But the backlash against tech that came to the fore in 2017 isn't going away. Predictions: The industry will face growing calls for regulation, Netflix is in big trouble, and the augmented reality bubble will burst.It was a rough year for Big Tech[1], at least aside from members' financial results. After years of unencumbered growth and fawning coverage in the press, the tech giants got hit with a huge backlash in 2017, largely concerning their role in society. After that public relations disaster, no one is probably more glad to see the year come to a close than the members of Big Tech. </p><p>Unfortunately for those companies, there are few signs the backlash will abate in 2018. But a continuation of the giants' image troubles isn't the only thing we can expect in the coming year. Instead, the tech industry and its biggest members are likely to see a mix of good and bad in 2018. As we say goodbye to 2017, here are some of the most important things I think will happen in tech next year.There will be a bigger push for regulation in the USThe big tech companies grew into behemoths without having to worry much about the US government stepping in to curb their power or dictate how they did things. In fact no one in the halls of power really talked seriously about regulating Big Tech. But that's changing. The populist backlash against the tech giants this year bled into the halls of the Senate, culminating in one of the first significant efforts to regulate some of those companies \u2014 the introduction of the Honest Ads Act. That proposed law would have required people placing political ads on internet sites such as Facebook and Google to follow the same transparency rules that apply to television, radio, and print. While that bill stalled, the push for regulation is only going to continue. And the proposed rules could cover a lot more than just political ads.\u00a0 For example, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner has held meetings with experts looking into whether or not tech companies intentionally make products addictive, according to Axios[2]. The meetings come as a growing number of such experts are warning that the dopamine hit you get whenever your Instagram post gets 100+ likes may not be incidental, but an intended result of the design of such features. Expect to see additional inquiries along the lines of Warner's. And don't be surprised if you see more bills proposed that might target not only political ads and addiction, but privacy and the industry's arguably anticompetitive practices. Of course, the chances of any new regulations being put in place by an antiregulatory Trump administration or any new legislation being passed by a Republican-controlled Congress \u2014 even in this political climate \u2014 is next to zero. But it is significant that more policymakers are keeping a closer eye on the tech industry.Disney will become Netflix's biggest rival, and a war will beginNetflix has room to worry in the coming year, because Disney is clearly gunning for it. The Mouse House's bid to purchase much of 21st Century Fox is clearly aimed at Netflix. But even if the government blocks that deal, Disney is poised to become Netflix's biggest rival. Next year, the Hollywood giant will launch its first standalone streaming service. That service will be packed full of the conglomerate's impressive collection of movies and television shows, which includes everything from Mickey Mouse to Luke Skywalker. Additionally, Disney-owned ESPN will finally launch its own streaming video service, which should be enticing to those cord cutters who are tired of missing their favorite sports. But Disney could be in an even better position to challenge Netflix if the Fox deal does go through. In addition to gaining a majority stake in Netflix-rival Hulu[3], the Mouse House would get access to more live sports, an even broader assortment of valuable intellectual property, including the movie rights to Marvel's X-Men, and a great collection of television series from the FX network. All of this comes in the wake of Disney announcing that it plans to pull its library from Netflix. That move alone is going to force Netflix to spend billions of dollars to develop new TV shows and movies to replace what it's losing from Disney. Those efforts could succeed \u2014 or they could be flops. Disney, for its part, doesn't have to worry as much about flops. It already has every weapon it needs in its budding war against Netflix.Tech companies will pour more money into Hollywood \u2014 but get little in returnApple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook are all investing heavily in developing original movies, television shows, and other video content. Each is slated to pour in billions of dollars in the endeavor. Their ambitions are understandable. For Apple, being able to offer some great TV series in Apple Music would help set the service apart from rivals such as Spotify and Pandora. It would also give Apple a way to squeeze more money out of customers after they buy one of its gadgets. Meanwhile, Google and Facebook hope to grow their ad businesses by getting a piece of the lucrative television ad market. And Amazon hopes to drive subscriptions to its Prime service, because Prime customers tend to buy more things from it than other consumers. But motivations and money aside, the tech giants' efforts aren't likely to produce many hits, if this past year is any indication. Apple's first original shows, \"Carpool Karaoke\" and \"Planet of the Apps,\" were not only critical duds, there's little evidence they found a significant audience. Google produced shows for YouTube featuring stars including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, but viewership has been mediocre[4]. And Facebook's new Watch video service has performed poorly[5]. While Amazon's had more success both critically and commercially, that success could be undermined by the recent sexual misconduct allegations against its former studio head[6] and against Jeffrey Tambor[7], the star of one of its most high-profile shows. Apple appears to have learned from some of its mistakes, hiring a pair of A-list producers to head up its video effort[8]. But it's hard to see how Apple Music in particular can set itself apart from all the other video services with just a handful of shows. It's going to need to build up a much deeper library and is going to need to develop a blockbuster, must-watch show. Good luck. For its part, Hollywood seems glad to take all the \"dumb money\" flowing in from the tech companies, as a connected source told New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo[9] earlier this year. To date, the tech giants, aside from Netflix and Amazon, haven't shown that they know much about how to produce great content besides writing a fat check. But the truth is that the tech companies' seemingly bottomless pits of money can't buy hits. You can hire the best talent in the world, but you also have to know how to get people to watch what they produce. And that's something the tech companies don't seem to have figured out yet. So, get ready for another year of flops funded by dumb tech money.China's consumer brands will bomb in the US Apple and Samsung have the US smartphone market locked up. According to comScore's latest numbers[10], iPhone owners account for 45% of all US wireless subscribers with a smartphone. Samsung phone owners comprise another 29%. Owners of devices from all other manufacturers barely register. Huawei and Xiaomi, China's two smartphone giants whose devices are popular in emerging market countries, aren't daunted by Apple and Samsung's US dominance.\u00a0Huawei plans to start selling a new smartphone through AT...n early 2018, according to The Information[11]. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is in talks with AT...nd Verizon, Bloomberg reported[12]. However, if history is any indication, the Chinese companies' US push is doomed. The smartphone market is littered with companies that tried to take on Apple and Samsung here and failed \u2014 HTC, Motorola, Essential, ZTE, Google, and so many more. The lesson? If you can't offer something unique and offer it through all the major carriers and retailers, you might as well not even try. It's simply too late in the game for another player to come in and give the US more of the same.We'll all start worrying about Amazon's powerNext year will see the Amazonification of even more aspects of our lives beyond just standard online shopping. Amazon has plans to expand into pharmaceuticals[13], digital advertising[14], and shipping, while increasing its presence in physical stores. The company is rapidly transforming itself from a simple digital department store into a commerce colossus that could soon add a Prime layer to practically everything we consume. When Amazon has entered new areas in the past, its expansion has often come at the expense of the former leaders of those areas. Grocery chains, for example, saw their stocks collapse[15] when Amazon announced it planned to buy Whole Foods. Imagine what's going to happen to drug store chain CVS when Amazon starts selling prescriptions or to Macys if Amazon buys a brick-and-mortar department store like Nordstrom[16]. With nearly unlimited cash and no viable competitors, Amazon will have unchecked power to topple nearly any consumer industry it wants. By the end of 2018, we'll have to start asking ourselves if it's a good thing that Amazon has its claws in so many aspects of commerce and our lives. I'm going to predict the answer will be \"no.\"The augmented reality bubble will burstAugmented reality (AR), the technology that layers virtual images on top of real ones, has replaced its cousin, virtual reality, as the most overhyped new tech. Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, and just about every other major consumer company in the industry have started laying the groundwork for turning AR devices and experiences into the next big thing after smartphones and smartphone apps. But despite all the buzz, we haven't yet seen anything that really demonstrates AR's alleged potential \u2014 unless you want to count Snapchat's dancing hot dog. Smartphones, which are the early showcase for AR experiences, turn out to be a terrible medium for the technology. And we've seen little evidence to date that developers can use AR to create anything truly innovative or useful. AR technology likely won't catch up to the hype surrounding it until someone invents computerized smart glasses that people will actually want to wear. If the AR headset Magic Leap recently unveiled is any indication, that's a long way off. Really, who would want to strap on a monstrosity like this?Because compelling, consumer-ready AR devices are still years away, the AR hype fueled by Apple, Google, and others will collapse next year. Venture capital investments in AR will dry up, and the bubble will burst. See you again in the 2020s.The artificial intelligence bubble will balloonArtificial intelligence has become the catch-all term for computers using what they know about the world to make decisions about new data. Self-driving cars use AI to navigate. Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant uses it to figure out which brand to get when you tell it to buy you some dish soap. Google uses it to automatically organize your photos into albums based on location and facial recognition. AI is the most promising and useful concept in technology we have, even if you don't necessarily see it every day. It's powering the most promising companies and initiatives across all industries, and its importance is only going to grow. Any company that's not thinking about how AI can make their products better will be doomed to fail.NOW WATCH: Thursday's big net neutrality vote could drastically change the internet \u2014 here's

After that public relations disaster, no one is probably more glad to see the year come to a close than the members of Big Tech. Unfortunately for those companies, there are few signs the backlash will abate in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a continuation of the giants' image troubles isn't the only thing we can expect in the coming year. Instead, the tech industry and its biggest members are likely to see a mix of good and bad in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we say goodbye to 2017, here are some of the most important things I think will happen in tech next year.</p><h>There will be a bigger push for regulation in the US</h><p>The big tech companies grew into behemoths without having to worry much about the US government stepping in to curb their power or dictate how they did things. In fact no one in the halls of power really talked seriously about regulating Big Tech.</p><p>REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueBut that's changing. The populist backlash against the tech giants this year bled into the halls of the Senate, culminating in one of the first significant efforts to regulate some of those companies - the introduction of the Honest Ads Act. That proposed law would have required people placing political ads on internet sites such as Facebook and Google to follow the same transparency rules that apply to television, radio, and print.</p><p>While that bill stalled, the push for regulation is only going to continue. And the proposed rules could cover a lot more than just political ads.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner has held meetings with experts looking into whether or not tech companies intentionally make products addictive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/big-techs-biggest-test-is-ahead-2518973101.html\">according to Axios</url>. The meetings come as a growing number of such experts are warning that the dopamine hit you get whenever your Instagram post gets 100+ likes may not be incidental, but an intended result of the design of such features.</p><p>Expect to see additional inquiries along the lines of Warner's. And don't be surprised if you see more bills proposed that might target not only political ads and addiction, but privacy and the industry's arguably anticompetitive practices.</p><p>Of course, the chances of any new regulations being put in place by an antiregulatory Trump administration or any new legislation being passed by a Republican-controlled Congress - even in this political climate - is next to zero. But it is significant that more policymakers are keeping a closer eye on the tech industry.</p><h>Disney will become Netflix's biggest rival, and a war will begin</h><p>Netflix has room to worry in the coming year, because Disney is clearly gunning for it.</p><p>The Mouse House's bid to purchase much of 21st Century Fox is clearly aimed at Netflix. But even if the government blocks that deal, Disney is poised to become Netflix's biggest rival.</p><p>Associated PressNext year, the Hollywood giant will launch its first standalone streaming service. That service will be packed full of the conglomerate's impressive collection of movies and television shows, which includes everything from Mickey Mouse to Luke Skywalker. Additionally, Disney-owned ESPN will finally launch its own streaming video service, which should be enticing to those cord cutters who are tired of missing their favorite sports.</p><p>But Disney could be in an even better position to challenge Netflix if the Fox deal does go through. In addition to gaining <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/disney-fox-takeover-deal-a-weapon-against-netflix-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">a majority stake in Netflix-rival Hulu</url>, the Mouse House would get access to more live sports, an even broader assortment of valuable intellectual property, including the movie rights to Marvel's X-Men, and a great collection of television series from the FX network.</p><p>All of this comes in the wake of Disney announcing that it plans to pull its library from Netflix. That move alone is going to force Netflix to spend billions of dollars to develop new TV shows and movies to replace what it's losing from Disney. Those efforts could succeed - or they could be flops.</p><p>Disney, for its part, doesn't have to worry as much about flops. It already has every weapon it needs in its budding war against Netflix.</p><h>Tech companies will pour more money into Hollywood - but get little in return</h><p>Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook are all investing heavily in developing original movies, television shows, and other video content. Each is slated to pour in billions of dollars in the endeavor.</p><p>Their ambitions are understandable. For Apple, being able to offer some great TV series in Apple Music would help set the service apart from rivals such as Spotify and Pandora. It would also give Apple a way to squeeze more money out of customers after they buy one of its gadgets.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google and Facebook hope to grow their ad businesses by getting a piece of the lucrative television ad market. And Amazon hopes to drive subscriptions to its Prime service, because Prime customers tend to buy more things from it than other consumers.</p><p>But motivations and money aside, the tech giants' efforts aren't likely to produce many hits, if this past year is any indication.</p><p>AppleApple's first original shows, \"Carpool Karaoke\" and \"Planet of the Apps,\" were not only critical duds, there's little evidence they found a significant audience. Google produced shows for YouTube featuring stars including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, but <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-original-series-are-not-setting-the-world-on-fire-2017-12?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">viewership has been mediocre</url>. And Facebook's new Watch video service       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-facebooks-watch-strategy-for-tv-original-video?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">has performed poorly</url>.</p><p>While Amazon's had more success both critically and commercially, that success could be undermined by the recent sexual misconduct allegations <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-studios-roy-price-sexual-remarks-investigation-2017-8?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">against its former studio head</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-tambor-of-transparent-investigated-by-amazon-for-sexual-harassment-2017-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">against Jeffrey Tambor</url>, the star of one of its most high-profile shows.</p><p>Apple appears to have learned from some of its mistakes, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-hires-sony-execs-jamie-erlich-and-zack-van-amburg-to-lead-video-2017-6?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">hiring a pair of A-list producers to head up its video effort</url>. But it's hard to see how Apple Music in particular can set itself apart from all the other video services with just a handful of shows. It's going to need to build up a much deeper library and is going to need to develop a blockbuster, must-watch show. Good luck.</p><p>For its part, Hollywood seems glad to take all the \"dumb money\" flowing in from the tech companies, as a connected source told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/technology/the-frightful-five-want-to-rule-entertainment-they-are-hitting-limits.html\">New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo</url> earlier this year. To date, the tech giants, aside from Netflix and Amazon, haven't shown that they know much about how to produce great content besides writing a fat check.</p><p>But the truth is that the tech companies' seemingly bottomless pits of money can't buy hits. You can hire the best talent in the world, but you also have to know how to get people to watch what they produce. And that's something the tech companies don't seem to have figured out yet. So, get ready for another year of flops funded by dumb tech money.</p><h>China's consumer brands will bomb in the US</h><p>Hollis Johnson/Business Insider</p><p>Apple and Samsung have the US smartphone market locked up. According to comScore's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/comscore-reports-june-2017-us-smartphone-subscriber-market-share-300498296.html\">latest numbers</url>, iPhone owners account for 45% of all US wireless subscribers with a smartphone. Samsung phone owners comprise another 29%. Owners of devices from all other manufacturers barely register.</p><p>Huawei and Xiaomi, China's two smartphone giants whose devices are popular in emerging market countries, aren't daunted by Apple and Samsung's US dominance.\u00a0Huawei plans to start selling a new smartphone through AT&amp;T in early 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/huawei-expected-to-gain-u-s-foothold-with-at-t\">according to The Information</url>. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is in talks with AT&amp;T and Verizon,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/china-s-top-phone-makers-poised-to-challenge-apple-on-home-turf\">Bloomberg reported</url>.</p><p>However, if history is any indication, the Chinese companies' US push is doomed. The smartphone market is littered with companies that tried to take on Apple and Samsung here and failed - HTC, Motorola, Essential, ZTE, Google, and so many more.</p><p>The lesson? If you can't offer something unique and offer it through all the major carriers and retailers, you might as well not even try. It's simply too late in the game for another player to come in and give the US more of the same.</p><h>We'll all start worrying about Amazon's power</h><p>Drew Angerer / Getty ImagesNext year will see the Amazonification of even more aspects of our lives beyond just standard online shopping.</p><p>Amazon has plans to expand into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/what-is-amazon-doing-in-health-and-the-pharmacy-industry.html\">pharmaceuticals</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/26/amazon-digital-advertising-push-in-2018.html\">digital advertising</url>, and shipping, while increasing its presence in physical stores. The company is rapidly transforming itself from a simple digital department store into a commerce colossus that could soon add a Prime layer to practically everything we consume.</p><p>When Amazon has entered new areas in the past, its expansion has often come at the expense of the former leaders of those areas. Grocery chains, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/r-grocery-chain-retailer-shares-tumble-on-amazon-whole-foods-deal-2017-6-1002099871?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">saw their stocks collapse</url> when Amazon announced it planned to buy Whole Foods. Imagine what's going to happen to drug store chain CVS when Amazon starts selling prescriptions or to Macys if       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/scott-galloway-predicts-amazon-nordstrom-amc-scripps-acquisition-2017-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Amazon buys a brick-and-mortar department store like Nordstrom</url>.</p><p>With nearly unlimited cash and no viable competitors, Amazon will have unchecked power to topple nearly any consumer industry it wants. By the end of 2018, we'll have to start asking ourselves if it's a good thing that Amazon has its claws in so many aspects of commerce and our lives. I'm going to predict the answer will be \"no.\"</p><h>The augmented reality bubble will burst</h><p>Augmented reality (AR), the technology that layers virtual images on top of real ones, has replaced its cousin, virtual reality, as the most overhyped new tech.</p><p>Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, and just about every other major consumer company in the industry have started laying the groundwork for turning AR devices and experiences into the next big thing after smartphones and smartphone apps. But despite all the buzz, we haven't yet seen anything that really demonstrates AR's alleged potential - unless you want to count Snapchat's dancing hot dog.</p><p>Smartphones, which are the early showcase for AR experiences, turn out to be a terrible medium for the technology. And we've seen little evidence to date that developers can use AR to create anything truly innovative or useful.</p><p>AR technology likely won't catch up to the hype surrounding it until someone invents computerized smart glasses that people will actually want to wear. If the AR headset Magic Leap recently unveiled is any indication, that's a long way off. Really, who would want to strap on a monstrosity like this?</p><p>Magic Leap</p><p>Because compelling, consumer-ready AR devices are still years away, the AR hype fueled by Apple, Google, and others will collapse next year. Venture capital investments in AR will dry up, and the bubble will burst. See you again in the 2020s.</p><h>The artificial intelligence bubble will balloon</h><p>Artificial intelligence has become the catch-all term for computers using what they know about the world to make decisions about new data. Self-driving cars use AI to navigate. Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant uses it to figure out which brand to get when you tell it to buy you some dish soap.

Some big earnings misses among U.S. blue chips after the bell on Wednesday may mean a rough day for those stocks, while in Canada, investors will react to earnings from CP Rail and Rogers Communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CP Rail beat Street estimates in reporting second quarter results Wednesday night and Rogers did the same this morning. For a rundown of more of the earnings action, read <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cp-rail-set-for-gains-thursday-but-several-us-blue-chips-poised-for/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cp-rail-set-for-gains-thursday-but-several-us-blue-chips-poised-for/</url> from the Globe's David Milstead.</p><p>Stock futures for all three major U.S. indexes and for the TSX were all down between 0.25 per cent 0.30 per cent as of 730 a.m. (ET)</p><p>The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, stayed strong but metal markets buckled badly on Thursday, as signs that China was resorting to credit-fueled stimulus again and trade jitters helped drive its currency to a one-year low.</p><p>Asian shares had struggled following the moves and Europe's bourses were also in the red as traders banked some of the recent gains that had hoisted the STOXX 600, the DAX and the CAC40 to 1-month highs.</p><p>Britain's Brexit-bruised pound was still suffering, falling below $1.30 for the first time in ten months, as stronger retail sales figures did little to repair the damage done by constant political turmoil and Wednesday's weak inflation data.</p><p>The yen at 113 per dollar, euro at $1.16 and most other European currencies were all weaker too. Instead of politics though they were just unable to fend off another advance from a dollar now near a 1-year high.</p><p>\"Sentiment right now is still very much in favor of buying the dollar,\" said Cr\u00e9dit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri.</p><p>\"It is positively correlated with risk appetite and risk appetite remains supported by the U.S. earnings season and there is a very strong notion among clients that there is further room for improvement.\"</p><p>That appetite got its latest boost as S&amp;P 500 rose to its highest in more than five months on Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed for a fifth session and the 'FANGs' group of big tech giants hit fresh all-time highs.</p><p>Ongoing trade jitters and developments in China however meant Asia had been a different picture.</p><p>China central bank plans to incentivise banks to expand lending to companies, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, a proposal that points to another shot of stimulus.</p><p>China's foreign-exchange regulator meanwhile said it would keep currency markets stable amid intensifying trade frictions with the United States.</p><p>The worries had pummeled the yuan to a one-year low of 6.7800 per dollar and 6.7427 in offshore and onshore trade.</p><p>The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite stocks index shed 1.0 per cent and Shanghai Composite index fell 0.6 per cent to head back towards a 1-1/2-year low it had set earlier this month.</p><p>\"Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People's Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,\" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.</p><p>\"If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.\"</p><p>She noted that although the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it hit during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015 when the central bank was seen intervening heavily.</p><p>METALS MELT</p><p>Metals markets were also in the firing line again. China is the world's biggest consumer of most industrial metals so worries about its economy can have a serious impact.</p><p>Copper and nickel were both down over 2 per cent on London's metal exchange, while zinc was down more than 3 per cent and lead shed 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Oil and gold also dropped again. Gold hit another one-year low of $1218.34 per ounce, while Brent and WTI U.S. crude futures were down 80 and 53 cents at $72.10 and $68.20 a barrel respectively.</p><p>Brent has fallen almost 9 per cent from last week's high above $79 on emerging evidence of higher production from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and the United States.</p><p>\"The outlook remains negative,\" said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.</p><p>Reuters</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/market-news/article-premarket-us-dollar-gains-metals-wane-as-china-grabs-for-monetary/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/market-news/article-premarket-us-dollar-gains-metals-wane-as-china-grabs-for-monetary/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180719ellipsis_5VFJIZ344BB45IQ2JVTZEKGNWE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV2-5VR1-F072-J2FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><timeReceived>7:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Free for 30 days</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Start 30-day free trialMy vision for a bold, thriving Britain enabled by BrexitBORIS JOHNSON</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOREIGN SECRETARY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who is one of the leaders of the Leave campaign</p><p>My friends, I must report that there are at least some people who are woefully underestimating this country. They think Brexit isn't going to happen. There are some media observers - in this country and around the world - who think we are going to bottle it.</p><p>I detect scepticism about whether we have the stamina, the guts, the persistence to pull it off. They think that the Brexit Bill will get lost in a House of Commons crevasse or buried in some interminable Jarndyce and Jarndyce legal proceedings. They think that we will simply despair of finding the way out of the EU and sit down on the floor and cry - like some toddler lost in the maze at Hampton Court.</p><p>Well, in so far as they doubt our resolve, I believe they are wrong; and I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our new national enterprise, and will succeed mightily.</p><p>Those 17.4 million people - they weren't fools, you know. They weren't stupid. They weren't as bad as some would have you believe. They were right; and even if you think they were wrong, I hope you agree that it is our duty, as democrats, to fulfil the mandate they gave us.</p><p>I respect those who voted to remain. More than respect them. They number some of the people I love the most in the world. And we all know that it is far too simple to divide this country into Leavers and Remainers.</p><p>We know the complexity of the decision, and how each person brought different mixtures of reason and emotion, heart and head.</p><p>There were lifelong Eurosceptics who decided at the last moment to remain; and a great many, in my view, whose heart said leave, but whose resolve was finally shaken by the warnings of the Government, the BBC, Barack Obama, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the CBI, every major political party and much of the media.</p><p>And then there were dyed-in-the-wool Europhiles, who thought Brussels was going too far and the only way to get change was to vote Leave.</p><p>It is not fair or right for one side to stereotype the motives of the other, because there is no stereotype. But the choice was binary. The result was decisive. There is simply no way - or no good way - of being 52 per cent out and 48 per cent in.</p><p>Before the referendum, we all agreed on what leaving the EU logically must entail: leaving the customs union and the single market, leaving the penumbra of the European Court of Justice; taking back control of our borders, cash, laws.</p><p>That is the programme that Theresa May set out with such clarity in her speech on January 17 at Lancaster House, and that is what she and her Government will deliver.</p><p>The answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>Overwhelmingly, I find that Leavers and Remainers are coming together - sometimes with a slight impatience - and urging us to get on and do it, and do a deal that is in the interests of both sides of the channel.</p><p>In 10 years', 20 years' time, when we consider the arc of history comprised by our 45 years of EU membership, we will have a better and fairer comprehension of these events - why the British people wanted to join and why, eventually and sometimes regretfully, they wanted to leave.</p><p>To understand why we wanted to join, you have to remember the shock of Suez, the loss of confidence in Westminster and Whitehall, the way in which this post-imperial future was sold to the people - a common market, a way of maximising trade.</p><p>Then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for; and you may remember how we were repeatedly assured that even if we were unhappy with the direction of the project, even if we disagreed with the concept of ever closer union, it was none the less worth putting up with it all for the sake of the influence we would have.</p><p>Of course we should pay tribute to the patriotic British men and women who went out to Brussels and got stuck into those institutions. The EU today is better for their contribution, but in the end we have to accept that they were only partly successful.</p><p>And it is notable that today their numbers have diminished to the point where the UK represents 16 per cent of EU GDP and 13 per cent of the population but only 3.6 per cent of EU officials.</p><p>If we had been asked to design the EU ourselves, on a blank sheet of paper, we would have nothing like the body that exists today. We tried so often to frustrate it.</p><p>To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>I was there at the Antibes EcoFin meeting, made up of the economics and finance ministers from all member states, when British officials made a gallant attempt to strangle the euro at birth with a project called the \"hard Ecu\", or fixed-rate European Currency Unit.</p><p>I was there when they ambushed Margaret Thatcher at the Rome summit with conclusions that the British thought had been explicitly rejected.</p><p>I remember how we kept trying to stop this or that - we rejected the very notion of political union; we tried to stop the expansion of majority voting.</p><p>And I remember the mantra of EU officials - Britain objects, Britain protests, but in the end she always signs up.</p><p>Although we kept trying to deny it - with an embarrassing lack of realism - we all knew that the logic was not economic but political. It wasn't about creating a single market; it was about trussing the nations together in a gigantic and ever-tightening cat's cradle of red tape.</p><p>I am afraid that all too often, when push comes to shove, that apparent willingness to support the UK position is less powerful than the great centripetal force of integration</p><p>And today the argument is still the same - that if only we were there we could somehow reform it all, make it more congenial to our instincts. I wish that were true. Yes, we do have allies - countries that look to us for a lead on deregulation, and free markets, and trying to resist the centralising role of the Commission. But I am afraid that all too often, when push comes to shove, that apparent willingness to support the UK position is less powerful than the great centripetal force of integration.</p><p>To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe!</p><p>I look ahead over the next 15 years at what may be coming down the track: the push to create an economic government of Europe, the activism of the ECJ in all the new competences of the Lisbon Treaty; and I ask myself, do I really believe that if we had stayed in, we would have produced a more devolved, a more decentralised, a more free-trading European Union?</p><p>I am afraid not.</p><p>And therefore it is wrong for us to be there - always trying to make things different, always getting in the way, always moaning.</p><p>Our destiny will be in our own hands</p><p>Our friends have embarked on a visionary but difficult project. Though the eurozone is growing more strongly now - and that is immensely positive - the logic of their ambition means trying to construct what is effectively a single polity out of 27 countries.</p><p>That plan is simply not for Britain, and we should have been more honest about it years ago. We have spent too much time trying, and often failing, to exert influence in the meeting rooms of Brussels. That exercise has diverted massive quantities of the intellectual energy of the British government, and it has not helped us to address the real challenges this country faces.</p><p>It is important to have a sense of perspective about these challenges, because the sky has not fallen in since June 23. We have not seen the prophesied 500,000 increase in unemployment and the Treasury has not so far sought to punish the British people with an emergency budget.</p><p>On the contrary: unemployment is at record lows, and manufacturing is booming \"in spite of Brexit\", as the BBC would put it. (Have you noticed that any good news is always \"in spite of Brexit\"?)</p><p>But, of course, this country still has chronic problems, and at least some of them have been exacerbated by the rigidities of EU membership - and certainly by the way we have chosen legally to apply those obligations.</p><p>Our infrastructure is too expensive - and takes far longer than France or other countries.</p><p>Successive governments have failed to build enough homes - though this is now being tackled by Sajid Javid .</p><p>Our vocational training is often superb - but still not inspirational, and we have yet to find a way of persuading middle-class kids that they might be just as well off getting a skill as a degree.</p><p>We do not conduct enough basic research in science, and I am afraid we still have too many schools that are content with second-best.</p><p>The result of all these failings - over decades - is that we have low productivity: lower than France or Germany.</p><p>I believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action.</p><p> believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action. But we also have a truly phenomenal ability to delay and to rack up cost. We have been able to blame bureaucracy and to blame Brussels, and my point is that after Brexit we will no longer be able to blame anyone but ourselves.</p><p>Our destiny will be in our own hands, and that will be immensely healthy.</p><p>We are not going to dismantle the corpus of EU law on exit. On the contrary, the objective of the repeal Bill is to incorporate it. Our systems of standards will remain absolutely flush with the rest of the EU.</p><p>We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours.</p><p>And yes - once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology.</p><p>The NHS is one of the great unifying institutions of our country. It is the top political priority of the British people and, under the leadership of Jeremy Hunt, it is indeed the top priority of the Conservative Party. Coming out of the EU will give us an opportunity to drive that message home.</p><p>And as we take back control of our cash, and our borders, and our laws, we will certainly not jettison what is good. We will keep environmental and social protections that are fair and wise.</p><p>Outside the EU, there are obvious opportunities</p><p>But over time we will be able to diverge from the great accumulated conglomerate, to act with regulatory freedom. I mean no disrespect to the authors and champions of the single market - but whether you believe such notable authorities as Peter Mandelson, who once claimed that EU regulation cost us 4 per cent of GDP, or Gordon Brown, who said the cost was nearer 7 per cent, it is fair to say that it has not produced the growth or the synergies that were originally forecast.</p><p>Outside the EU, there are obvious opportunities - in agriculture, fisheries, in the setting of indirect taxation. At the stroke of a pen, for instance,  the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons . This is often demanded by Parliament but - absurdly - it is legally impossible to deliver.</p><p>We will have an immigration policy that suits the UK, not slamming the door but welcoming the talent we need, from the EU and around the world. Of course we will make sure that business gets the skills it needs, but business will no longer be able to use immigration as an excuse not to invest in the young people of this country.</p><p>And I can think of obvious ways in which Brexit can help us tackle the housing crisis - perhaps the single biggest challenge facing the younger generation.</p><p>There may be ways of simplifying planning procedures, post-Brexit, and abbreviating impact assessments, without in any way compromising the environment.</p><p>It is often pointed out that the price of housing in certain parts of London may be pushed up by buyers from overseas. But there is no point in putting any kind of tax on foreign buyers, because the inhabitants of 27 other countries cannot legally be treated as foreign.</p><p>No one would want a tax that discouraged international investment and stopped good developments from happening. No one would want to send a signal that the London market was closed. But it would at least be possible to have the argument. That is what we mean by taking back control.</p><p>Outside the EU, we will be on our mettle - obliged to set policy to prioritise areas where the UK is strong. One of the advantages of investing in the NHS - if we combine that investment with reform - is that we can turbo-charge the role of our health service in driving bioscience.</p><p>The NHS is a national asset whose data banks record the dizzying range of diseases that our flesh is heir to. Freed from EU regimes - often cumbersome and hard to change - we will be able to accelerate our work on gene therapy - an infant science, now taking its first faltering steps, whose potential is gigantic. Britain is already at the forefront of this, and we can lengthen our lead.</p><p>Britain can become a tech powerhouse</p><p>We should seize the opportunity of Brexit to reform our tax system. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, argued in 2015 that our system is currently skewed so as to discourage investment. He believes that reform could raise output by around 20 per cent.</p><p>We should use the opportunities afforded by historically low interest rates to give this country the infrastructure it deserves - especially in London, the most dynamic and productive urban economy in Europe, where things seem frankly to have gone a bit quiet since the departure of the last Mayor.</p><p>There is an agenda that will help to drive the UK economy for decades - new road tunnels, new bridges, Crossrail 2, Tube extensions, and the housing developments made possible by this infrastructure.</p><p>This is our chance to catch the wave of new technology, and to put Britain in the lead. In the next 20 years I believe traditional car companies will vanish as we switch to automated vehicles. Millions of jobs will go, and millions of new jobs will be created. Traditional supply chains will be disrupted, and new supply chains will be created.</p><p>And, of course, the instinct of the European Commission will always be to protect against that revolution, to regulate, to muffle that change - listening, as they always do, to the vested interests of the big EU manufacturers.</p><p>People often ask themselves why the EU has failed to produced a single major tech giant on the scale of those found in America. Well, part of the answer may be found in the statist and top-down approach that characterises the thinking of the Commission.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what happened to Minitel, the state-owned and managed French equivalent of Google? Or what good was done by all those directives - dating from the early Nineties - on les r\u00e9seaux t\u00e9l\u00e9matiques? Did they produce a European champion? Pas encore.</p><p>There are in fact four zones of the world where big tech investments are made: Boston, Silicon Valley, Shanghai and the triangle formed by London, Oxford and Cambridge.</p><p>Let us have the confidence to experiment, to be at the cutting edge. My brother, Jo Johnson, is finalising the candidates for the location of a new UK space centre, and this Government is investing in the truly revolutionary Sabre project in Hampshire - a system that promises radically to reduce our journey times around this Earth.</p><p>We are investing in the new battery technology that will be part of the driverless revolution. And this country already boasts companies such as Deep Mind, one of the most promising artificial intelligence companies in the world.</p><p>These are just some of the most obvious areas for the future development of UK technology. What we cannot now know - as the great French economist Bastiat observed in the 19th century - is the unseen opportunity cost of the way the UK economic structure has evolved to fit the EU over the last four and a half decades, and the productive ways in which it might now evolve.</p><p>But we do know one thing: that we will be able to get on and do free-trade deals, to campaign for free trade that has lifted billions out of poverty, which so badly needs a new champion.</p><p>We will be able to intensify old friendships around the world, not least with fast-growing Commonwealth economies, and to build a truly Global Britain.</p><p>Brexit will work for everyone</p><p>Britain's success will not be a bad thing for our friends across the Channel. On the contrary, it will mean a bigger market in the UK for everything from Italian cars to German wine. And we will be there for our friends and partners.</p><p>We will be the largest military power in Europe, and with our growing defence budget we are now making an ever-more vivid commitment to the defence of Europe - like the new deployments in Estonia - and to our common European ideals and values.</p><p>That is the goal the Prime Minister has set out - a strong EU, buttressed and supported by a strong UK, and linked by a deep and special partnership founded on the mutual benefits of free trade.</p><p>We have a glorious future - but hardly any of this would be possible under the bizarre and incoherent plans of the Labour Party. It seems that Jeremy Corbyn has chickened out. He has already betrayed the students who voted for him, dropping his absurd pledge to cancel all their debts.</p><p>Now he is betraying the millions of Labour supporters who voted Leave and who thought that he also wanted to leave, to get on and deliver the will of the people. (For a man of such unbending Lefty principle, he seems to have a remarkable beardy ability to speak out both sides of his mouth.)</p><p>Now it appears he wants to remain in the single market and the customs union. In other words, he would make a complete mockery of Brexit, and turn an opportunity into a national humiliation. It would be the worst of both worlds, with the UK turned into a vassal state - taking direction from the EU, but with no power to influence the EU's decisions.</p><p>It is a totally invertebrate position, and betrays a dismal lack of confidence in this country.</p><p>We are not turning our backs on the world</p><p>I end on the point with which I began - that groundless and peculiar lack of confidence in Britain.</p><p>I remember when the project for European citizenship was launched by Jacques Delors in the early Nineties. At the time, I thought it was a bit of a gimmick. I used to doubt that you could build such a thing as a European identity out of the mosaic of states.</p><p>I was indignant when they came out with the European passport, and when they said that all car number plates had to carry the 12-star flag, but I never thought that Brussels would succeed in its aim.</p><p>I used to look at the Brussels bumper stickers saying \"Mon patrie, c'est Europe\" and think it was a bit of a laugh, and that they would never engender a genuine Euro-patriotism, or compete with people's natural feelings for their own country.</p><p>I have to say that I am now not so sure. I think I was complacent. I look at so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces and I am troubled with the thought that people are beginning to have genuinely split allegiances.</p><p>And when people say that they feel they have more in common with others in Europe than with people who voted Leave, I want to say: \"But that is part of the reason why people voted Leave.\"</p><p>You don't have to be some tub-thumping nationalist to worry that a transnational sense of allegiance can weaken the ties between us; and you don't have to be an out-and-out nationalist to feel an immense pride in this country and what it can do.</p><p>We have the biggest financial centre in this hemisphere - and, by common consent, we will still have one by the time the Brexit controversy is a distant memory. I have seen the prophets of doom proved wrong so many times.</p><p>They said it would be a disaster if we left the ERM in 1992, and again if we failed to join the euro in 1999; and again in the 2008 crash, when they prophesied that the bankers would flee to Zug and Zurich. Yet London has sailed serenely through, riding the waves of adversity, as we have for centuries.</p><p>Look at Canary Wharf - a banking district now bigger than Frankfurt itself.</p><p>Look at our universities - the best in the world, with just one Cambridge college responsible not just for more Nobel prizes than France but indeed for more than Russia and China combined.</p><p>It is an astonishing fact that of all the kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in the world, one in seven was educated in this country. While I have been Foreign Secretary, I am proud to have expanded the amazing Chevening and Commonwealth scholarship schemes that bring so many talented people into this country's system, which will ensure that the leaders of the world will be educated in Britain - and have a natural understanding of and affinity for Britain - for generations to come.</p><p>Britain at the beginning of the 21st century was the second-greatest power on Earth after America.</p><p>Just stand on the streets of central London and listen to the excitement of the tourists. We have more international visitors to our city than any other capital, including Paris and New York.</p><p>When you go to the British Museum, you visit the world's greatest thesaurus of global culture, and a place that attracts more visitors than the entire tourist industry of 10 other EU countries that I will not mention. So don't you tell me that we are turning our backs on the world. It is not physically or emotionally possible.</p><p>Britain can be the greatest country on Earth</p><p>I was proud to be mayor of the greatest city on Earth, and I believe we can be the greatest country on Earth. Indeed, a recent estimate by the Henry Jackson Society just this month made a tally of the various nations' political, economic and cultural throw-weight, and concluded that, with the second biggest contribution to Nato; with our forces deployed around the world; with our bankers, our chefs, our scientists, our poets and, yes, our diplomats, Britain at the beginning of the 21st century was the second-greatest power on Earth after America.</p><p>And since I regard the United States as one of the finest ideological and cultural creations of this country - even if involuntarily - I am prepared to live with that assessment.</p><p>We have more British people living overseas - a bigger diaspora - than any other OECD country. A great, bright, warm six-million-strong constellation of British minds and British hearts, a pulse in the eternal mind, no less, giving somewhere back the thoughts by Britain given (as Rupert Brooke almost puts it). Aid workers, journalists, businesspeople, artists, all helping in myriad ways to make the world a better place.</p><p>We have the youngest and fastest-growing population of any major EU economy, and on current estimates we will be the most populous country in western Europe by the middle of this century.</p><p>If we organise, if we plan, if we build the homes and the infrastructure we need, if we give our young people the skills and the confidence that they could so easily acquire, then we can also ensure that this country is not just the place where everyone wants to come and live, but the place with the highest standard of living, with the per-capita GDP, the productivity and the quality of life that we deserve.</p><p>That means insisting on a culture that is pro-business and pro-enterprise, but one that is so dynamic that fat cats can no longer sit unpunished in their jobs when they let everyone down.</p><p>It means simplifying regulation, and cutting taxes, wherever we can - but also ensuring that everyone in a company is decently paid, because that is the way to boost productivity.</p><p>I am not saying that all this will be some kind of cinch. I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny.</p><p>All I say is that they are in grievous error - all those who write off this country, who think we don't have it in us, who think that we lack the nerve and the confidence to tackle the task ahead.</p><p>They have been proved wrong before and, believe me, they will be proved wrong again.</p><p>Start your free 30-day trial of Premium today<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Access to unlimited Premium articles online and in the Telegraph App</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Subscriber only events</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Redeem exclusive Telegraph Rewards</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Sign up nowFind out more</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-37746026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ3-YN21-F021-60G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4119\"/><timeReceived>1:38 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

This was a year their industry stood accused of institutionalised sexism and misogyny, of ripping apart the planet's social fabric, destroying the minds of a generation and breaking the chains of morality to fly free in untethered pursuit of obscene profit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, money talks and it meant Big Tech remained the loudest voice in the financial world. Each one of the big five - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon - boasted a substantial rise in share prices. It seems the dotcom kids who aimed to free humanity from its capitalist shackles and create a liberally-minded socialist utopia have simply taken the reins from their corporate forefathers and whipped the horses harder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the moral compass of Big Tech under deep suspicion as we kick off 2018, here are four somewhat pessimistic predictions on how the driverless juggernaut of progress may soon revolutionise the way we live, work, feel and think ... </p><p>MONEY BECOMES MEANINGLESS</p><p>PINK Floyd branded money a \"gas\" in 1973, confusing scientists unfamiliar with groovy slang. Yet in 2018, it seems gas has more of a solid, tangible state than some currencies. Just as world markets are built upon collective faith in another country's ClearScore rating, new digital \"cryptocurrencies\" -  there's now 1,300 and rising -  are gaining credibility through a similar collective assumption in their worth. Yet, there is no gold reserve to back up and secure digital cash, just mass worship of the \"brand\". It's a grand madness with investors chasing will-o'-the-wisp and grasping at rainbows.</p><p>Last year belonged to Bitcoin, but young shavers Ripple and Stellar are currently hot on its heels, with both gaining wild traction this week. It seems this might be the year cryptocurrencies shake the foundations of the established world order - soulless Frankenstein's monsters intent on destroying the financial system that birthed them, their very existence and abundance rendering established currencies redundant. </p><p>What's even more bizarre is that many shrewd digital evangelists - inspired equally by Mark Zuckerberg and Del Boy - are presently going cap in hand to venture capitalists, claiming to have created their own digital currencies. And they are actually finding willing investors. </p><p>The fundamental illusion and artifice of cryptocurrency is perhaps symbolic of free market capitalism itself - with power and wealth ultimately revealed as mirages as we reach the finishing line of our egocentric sprints of existance.</p><p>THE EMPIRES STRIKE BACK</p><p>THERE was undoubtedly a great disturbance in the force last year, a tangible disillusionment with the power of instant communication, digital technology and social media. This mainly focused upon the adverse societal consequences of information technology, from future job losses to the manipulation of public opinion. The latter boasting heinous real-world consequences where a tantrum-prone, attention-seeking Twitter addict became President of the USA. Such events have been accompanied by a dramatic drop in public favour for California's Silicon Valley, long considered the global epicentre of innovation and global economic growth. </p><p>Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan perhaps encapsulated growing concern at the tech elite's perceived moral vacuum by referring to its CEOs as \"America's real overlords\", damning them as \"moral Martians who operate on some weird new postmodern ethical wavelength\". This year will undoubtedly see an abundance of PR paint jobs by Big Tech, with some form of internal moral policing suggested by a smiley collective of top firms. They will claim such a panel will be fully independent of Silicon Valley, and will aim to spark an honest discourse on regulation and monitoring of certain technology advances. We will be subjected to navel-gazing regrets from tech company founders about the addictive qualities of their creations. Don't be fooled, however. These crocodile tears are a smokescreen to avoid the real debate on full transparency - one we should demand - regarding seismic advances in technology which will greatly affect all our lives.</p><p>THE DEATH OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH </p><p>IN 2018, it's possible our thoughts will be a waste product like any other excretion, the half-digested echoes of nutrition-free unsolicited opinion, lies and spin. Look around. Traditional mainstream media companies spew out cheap clickbait in a bewildered death rattle reflex. State-sponsored viral campaigning influences everything from the Scottish independence referendum to the planetary apocalypse of a Trump presidency. Algorithmic mobile surveillance accurately predicts the colour, texture and taste of your bellybutton fluff. And automatically orders more when you scoop it out. The future arrived while our attentions were diverted by great TV shows, birthing a topsy-turvy new paradigm where \"truth\" is the pot of gold buried at the end of a cloud of static. </p><p> So, apart from the Sunday Herald, where do we find the purveyors of veritas in this new era? Perhaps not in the American \"mainstream media\". Earlier this year, The Washington Post staked its claim on righteousness, adding a startling \"Democracy dies in darkness\" motto underneath its masthead. The message was clear but the irony of the paper's owner being <url normalizedValue=\"http://Amazon.com\">http://Amazon.com</url> founder Jeffrey P Bezos is hopefully not lost on the organ's readers. Let's hope Bezos was sincere when he said: \"I think a lot of us believe that democracy dies in darkness, that certain institutions have a very important role in making sure that there is light.\" </p><p>This year, that light will dim even further when the informational terrain of the internet becomes even stranger - with brain-mimicking AI neural networks sparking a new acceleration in machine learning. On a micro scale, this bespoke AI will be capable of casually generating fake visuals and audio to put words in the mouths of public figures - and you too, if you're targeted. On a macro scale, the war on truth will become a massacre of willing cannon fodder, trapping us all within ego-gratifying online reality bubbles. Some of these enslaving tech platforms will be brought to you by Amazon. Darkness indeed, Mr Bezos.</p><p>FAREWELL TO MOBILE PHONES</p><p>YOU may recall the mundanity of rewinding those unwieldy VHS videos back to the start before returning them to the rental shop. Sometimes your player would viciously chew the tape and you'd have to spin it back manually with a bleeding, twisted thumb. One thing was clear - we all instinctively knew videotape was at the end of an evolutionary line, and that something new must arrive. So don't think for a second that tech giants Apple, Samsung and Sony haven't been listening to global grumbling about fragile touchscreen phones being nearly a decade old. The truth is they've already replaced your humble rectangular communication device in their research and development labs. And after Google's spectacular stumble with its unwieldy, stalker's dream \"glass\" eyewear, the other titans of tech will not be taking any chances when they eventually unveil the future - which is, by the way, augmented reality headsets. </p><p>These are a second skin for the eyes, a wizard's hat of sorts, aiming to revolutionise the way we see the world by bringing all inanimate surroundings to life. While virtual reality immerses but isolates, augmented reality overlays images and data onto the real one. AR's possibilities are endless, from the advertisers' dream of plastering the city street you're walking down with every offer, menu and discount imaginable. Even the sky above you will be chopped up and slices sold to the highest bidder in this vampiric new visual dawn. On the plus side, AR will also allow surgeons instant access to state-of-the-art medical techniques, streaming instructions on how to stick a mouse's ear onto your back or whatever. </p><p>Apple's CEO Tim Cook has said he considers AR as revolutionary as the smartphone. \"We're already doing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn,\" he recently hinted. \"AR is going to change technology forever.\" Chief design officer Jony Ive added: \"There are certain ideas that we have and we are waiting for the technology to catch up with the idea.\" </p><p>Could 2018 be the year? For the health of our Bitcoin-filled digital wallets, let's hope not. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNHER-NQ140847206</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNHER2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RBX-9WF1-JD7N-K2N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172807</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Herald (Glasgow)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 7, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The two candidates' performance in the debates, Mr Biden's choice of vice-president and coronavirus vaccine developments, which the current administration would be likely to claim credit for, can swiftly swing sentiment in either direction.</p><p> This election will therefore remain competitive despite the polling gap. Energising voter turnout, not just winning over independents, will be key for both candidates.</p><p> So rather than positioning today for a specific outcome, investors should have a plan to stay invested while tactically adjusting to higher volatility and potentially large moves among relative winners and losers of policy proposals.</p><p> Fundamentally, the pace of economic reopening and record-setting monetary easing and fiscal stimulus remain the more crucial drivers of risk assets in the coming months.</p><p>  For Asia, and in particular for trade-dependent economies like Singapore, this election is likely to matter more than any in the past.</p><p> With US-China relations at their lowest point in more than four decades, developments around trade, technology and supply chain restrictions will be closely watched.</p><p> In the meantime, Hong Kong has emerged as a new geopolitical flashpoint as the threat of financial sanctions over the new national security law looms.</p><p> Mr Trump's unorthodox approach to foreign relations has raised tensions, but investors should not assume that pressure from the US would disappear if he were to leave office.</p><p> A great power rivalry now defines the US-China relationship. A strategy of China containment, driven not by protectionism but by national security considerations, has broad bipartisan support and thus looks set to continue, regardless of who occupies the White House.</p><p><br/>Traders at the New York Stock Exchange in May. The writer says a unified Republican government would be more positive for stocks in the US, but a Democrat government would not necessarily be negative for equities. PHOTO: REUTERS<br/></p><p> Measures relating to high-tech export controls or the Huawei ban could well persist.</p><p> Investors should brace themselves for a future where there is increasing structural decoupling between the two economies.</p><p> However, political sabre-rattling doesn't readily translate into an immediate or meaningful economic impact.</p><p> Both the US and China are aware of the constraints imposed by their deep economic interdependence. Abrupt and extreme moves are still likely to be avoided even under a second Trump term, during which bilateral relations could remain rancorous yet functional.</p><p>  In a Biden presidency, relations should return to a more predictable footing, and the decision-making process should be less volatile.</p><p> In terms of approach, a Biden administration would be more multilateralist in garnering the support of allies to pressure China instead of going at it alone. Tariff uncertainty should also decline, which would boost investor sentiment.</p><p> That said, differences with China over human rights issues might be a greater sticking point under a Democratic administration.</p><p> As the thrust for globalisation loses popular support, whether the US rejoins the Trans-Pacific Partnership under Mr Biden is now uncertain.</p><p> Although it remains of great interest for Japan and other Asian economies, given the long-term impact on foreign direct investment, Mr Biden may look to renegotiate new terms before revitalising the trade pact.</p><p> On balance, Asian markets should do better with Mr Biden at the helm.</p><p>  Mr Trump and Mr Biden both favour greater infrastructure spending. Given the weakened state of the US economy, the immediate priority of the next administration is likely to be to boost growth and jobs.</p><p> Mr Trump favours further deregulation and lower taxes and an \"America first\" approach to international trade.</p><p> In contrast, Mr Biden seeks higher taxes and tighter regulations as well as more spending on climate change mitigation, federally funded healthcare and a higher minimum wage.</p><p> A \"blue wave\" (a unified Democrat government) wouldn't necessarily be negative for US equities, as accelerated fiscal spending should offset the impact of higher taxes.</p><p> The energy sector would be likely to be badly hurt by tighter regulations, while the regulatory tone on financials and Big Tech could cause some harm at the margin.</p><p> Assets exposed to energy efficiency, smart mobility and renewables, both in the US and abroad, would benefit from Mr Biden's greener agenda.</p><p> A \"red wave\" (a unified Republican government) would be slightly more positive for US stocks.</p><p> Potential infrastructure spending, a tax cut extension and continued deregulation would provide support for risk assets, but renewed trade war risks and related uncertainty would loom large on the outlook for earnings.</p><p> Select energy and financial companies stand to gain as the threat of tighter regulation recedes, while space and defence firms could also do well in a second Trump term.</p><p>  Risk assets globally have rebounded substantially from the lows in March. And we think they should still march higher for four reasons: a repeat of national lockdowns is unlikely, pent-up demand is driving economic recovery, the political consensus is now for sustained and large fiscal stimulus measures, and the infinite liquidity provided by global central banks is not going away any time soon.</p><p> US election outcomes are incredibly hard to call, and policies pledged during the campaign trail often deviate upon implementation.</p><p> Investors should therefore focus on the longer-term fundamentals that drive earnings and valuations, and avoid excessive concentration in stocks and sectors that could get whipsawed by changing political winds.</p><p>\u00b7 The writer is Asia-Pacific head of UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment office.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Traders at the New York Stock Exchange in May.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" Preparing for the worst, the U.K. and E.U. brace for a no deal Brexit with contingency plans to prevent chaos. Sentencing delayed, Trump's former National Security adviser's cozy plea deal is not looking too cozy anymore. An IPO flop by Japanese tech giant Softbank lost billions of dollars on its first day of trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with a major hack of the European Union's diplomatic communications network. A hack first reported by the \"New York Times\". The paper says cyber security firm Area 1 found hackers have been infiltrating the network for years, downloading thousands of cables, encrypted messages sent on what was meant to be a secure network. Area 1 made some of those hacked cables available to \"The Times.\" CNN has not yet reviewed the documents, but Area 1 has an idea of who might be behind the hack.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me now live from London the CNN's Samuel Burke. Samuel, it seems like these hackers wanted to learn everything they possibly could about international diplomacy. What did they find?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, it's incredibly interesting for the past two years, President Trump has brought a very different style to international relations. Now, we are finding out what these diplomats and world leaders think when they walk away from some of these incredible interactions with the U.S. President.</p><p>Let's just put on the screen the most sensitive topics that we see in these cable, starting with Trump's negotiations with China. President Xi Jinping quoted as saying working with Trump is like a no rules, free style boxing match. But more importantly, Xi reported as saying that Beijing will not submit to what he calls bullying from the United States, even if the trade war hurts everybody.</p><p>Now, when it comes to relationships with Russia, European diplomats described that meeting between Trump and President Putin in Finland back in July as successful, at least for Putin, not necessarily for Trump or the United States. Perhaps worrying in these cables, Crimea described as a hot zone where nuclear warheads might have already been deployed. And even though the U.S. has pulled out of the Iran deal, cable show European diplomats requesting to finance exports to Iran to entice that country to continue complying with the 2015 agreement.</p><p>Will, I think if you could summarize the most important sentiment here, the European Union seems to say that there's a negative attitude from President Trump toward the E.U. and the word they keep on using is that causes a lot of insecurity.</p><p>RIPLEY: It's so fascinating, and there's a reason why these cables are encrypted. These are diplomats that supposedly should be able to speak candidly. Do we have any idea who these hackers might be and are - is the E.U. taking steps to prevent this from happening again?</p><p>BURKE: Yes, the idea is that they can speak candidly, but certainly they're not feeling that today. Let me just also put up on the screen what we know and don't know about this hack, starting with the fact that that cyber security firm, Area 1 says these e-mails were accessed using techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of the China's People's Liberation Army.</p><p>But it was just a simple phishing campaign, Will, aimed at diplomats in Cyprus. These are e-mails that so many people get you to think it's from your work, you think it's from your cell phone company. You click it, put in your information and it turns out you've handed over your passwords to a foreign group, and many times, and then they can use that information to access your accounts or in this case, a much larger system.</p><p>Now, unlike WikiLeaks, which were high level cables, these are low level classified documents. And of course, the hackers didn't publish them. Very important to mention here that the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs says this \"New York Times\" report is suspicious, groundless and extremely irresponsible. They point out that China has been the victim of hacks, certainly, something that I hear from tech leaders in the United States, here in the European Union as well in China, Jack Ma once told me that Alibaba faces thousands of hacks a day, Will.</p><p>RIPLEY: Yes, and, of course, the Chinese would never want any candid conversation that Xi Jinping would have go out in public, especially if it's any way controversial. So obviously, they're watching this closely and we know you are, too. Samuel Burke, live in London. Thank you.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>RIPLEY: Well there are 100 days to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union - 100 days. Not a lot of time. The Prime Minister Theresa May has just been telling Parliament that she will reveal the results of her discussions with the E.U. in January. Now Britain's leading business groups, they are warning that time is running out to prevent the severe consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place.</p><p>And the U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal is reached with the European Union. I want to go to CNN's Anna Stewart who is live for us in London and has been following all of this.</p><p>Anna, some are saying that a no deal scenario for Brexit would have disastrous consequences. How much of that is scare mongering?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN: Yes, and the contingency planning that has come out in the last 24 hours from the government has also fueled speculation that what they're doing is scare mongering. And we've just had \"Prime Minister Question Time,\" thankfully the last of the year. I am sure, Theresa May feels the same as I do. And I can say how I appreciate Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party later on suggested that she was scare mongering here.</p><p>He think that she is essentially trying to run down the clock and make a no deal Brexit look likely and terrifying so that her Brexit deal is the only one people will vote for and they will vote for it.</p><p>Of course, the Prime Minister has refuted that and she also actually took Jeremy Corbyn to task over his confusing antics this week. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: They said they'd put on a vote of no confidence; then they said they wouldn't, then they said they would. Then they did it, but it wasn't effective. I know it's the Christmas season and the pantomime season. But what we see from the Labour front bench and the right Honorable gentleman, he is going to put a confidence vote. Oh, yes, he is. Oh, no, he isn't. I've got some news for him. I've got some advice for the right Honorable gentleman. Look behind you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: Clearly, the Prime Minister likes a bit of panto there. Now, what happened this week, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour opposition, it looked like he was going to bring forth a vote of confidence against the government, then he failed to do it, bringing one against the Prime Minister herself which effectively didn't mean much. It was fairly meaningless, symbolic, it's not going to get time in Parliament.</p><p>The smaller parties, Will, just in the last 24 hours have tried to put forward a confidence vote on the government, but they need Labour to join them and Labour is not joining them yet. But this, if it ever happens in the coming weeks or months, that would essentially pave the way for a new government to be formed or a snap election.</p><p>RIPLEY: Anna, if there wasn't so much at stake, it would be quite entertaining to go watch all of the drama unfold in Parliament. But, you know, there's another hot kind of issue that people are talking about. The Prime Minister ruled it out this week, but is this second referendum still a possibility?</p><p>STEWART: Well, a second referendum is something the Prime Minister has to rule out almost every day at the moment. There is so much chat about it. Frankly, it does not have the support at this stage that it would need to happen. Not within the Labour Party, not within the Conservative Party. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, he doesn't want it largely I think because two-thirds of his MPs are from Brexit areas. You know, it wouldn't be electorally not very useful for him to table that.</p><p>In addition, Will, it takes time, it takes about seven months for the last referendum in 2016, for the legislation to be passed. And then you've got the issue of what on earth would the question be? Because would it be in or out like we had last time or would it be hard Brexit, soft Brexit, no Brexit. Would it be Norway kind of Brexit, Canada kind of Brexit? I mean, there are just so many options. Parliament can't agree on anything at the moment. I can't imagine how that would go down, Will.</p><p>RIPLEY: You must be Brex-hausted, Anna Stewart. I have to steal that line from you. You e-mailed me earlier. I bet you can't wait for Christmas Break and maybe a little bit of a pause in all of this, but it will pick right back up. Anna Stewart, live in London. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up on news stream, the Trump organization, the campaign, the inauguration, the transition, the administration and now, even the charitable foundation all under investigation. Yes, the scandals keep piling up for the U.S. President. Also, a developing story. Another hit for Zimbabwe's Mugabe family. Authorities are looking to arrest the deposed leader's wife.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>Eleven minutes past 9:00 here in Hong Kong. It is Wednesday and you're watching \"News Stream.\" South African authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Grace Mugabe, the wife of the deposed Zimbabwean dictator, Robert Mugabe. Now, she's accused of assaulting a South African model in August of last year. A brutal assault if you believe the model's account of it all.</p><p>Now, South Africa is also applying for to Interpol to issue a red notice which is almost like an international arrest warrant calling for Grace Mugabe's arrest and extradition. This story breaking just in the last few hours. CNN's Eleni Giokos is live in Johannesburg for us. This has not been a great year for Zimbabwe's former First Lady.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes. It absolutely hasn't, and we know that the South African police, as you say, have issued that arrest warrant. What is interesting is that they are working closely with Interpol to try and force the warrant. They have applied for a red alert notice.</p><p>And if that does, in fact, come through, then Zimbabwe will be held accountable and liable to extradite Mugabe. Of course, this is going to be a very delicate situation because of the coup last year where Robert Mugabe and, of course, the First Lady were ousted out of government by Emmerson Mnangagwa and what is really important to note here is that Robert Mugabe and his wife have still be residing in the Presidential Palace.</p><p>So whether Zimbabwe is going to actually extradite Grace Mugabe is going to be interesting, but going back to these assault charges, Will, it's important to note that over the time that it occurred in South Africa, viral photos were, of course, made massive headlines in the country because the model had alleged that Mugabe had assaulted her with an electrical cable that she says had opened her head - open in around three places.</p><p>And over that time, the South African government had issued Mugabe diplomatic immunity, even though she was in the country not for diplomatic purposes, and that is when the prosecutor for the Oscar Pistorius trial stepped in and decided to represent the model. Of course that went through the courts and, of course, we've got the diplomatic immunity that has now been overturned and we stand here today with an arrest warrant for Grace Mugabe.</p><p>RIPLEY: It will be interesting, though, to see if Zimbabwean authorities comply. Eleni Giokos, a lot to watch there and we thank you for your live report. Now, to Washington where President Donald Trump is facing more blows to his already scandal-plagued Presidency.</p><p>Mr. Trump's charitable foundation, it is now closing its doors amid an ongoing civil lawsuit over its finances. Prosecutors say the organization was less of a charity and more like a personal piggy bank for Mr. Trump and his three eldest children. Meanwhile, a judge has ordered a unnamed foreign company to comply with a grand jury subpoena believed to be from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Now, the Justice Department has asked the firm to turn over information about its commercial activities.</p><p>And sentencing has been delayed for the President's former National Security adviser. In Tuesday's hearing, Michael Flynn eviscerated Mr. Trump's claim that he was entrapped by the FBI during the Russia investigation. Now, if you remember, Flynn was a top adviser to Donald Trump on National Security issues. He resigned from the Trump administration after he failed to tell the Vice President that he discussed sanctions with a Russian official.</p><p>[08:15:05]</p><p>RIPLEY: In December of 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to Federal investigators. For more on this, let's bring in CNN legal analyst Shan Wu who is live in Washington. Shan, let's start with Michael Flynn. So despite this humiliating dressing down that he got in court, he's not backing away from his guilty plea. He's still cooperating with the Special Counsel. So what does that mean for Flynn and also, frankly, for President Trump?</p><p>SHAN WU, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN: For Flynn, this is a second chance. Judge Emmet Sullivan really threw a monkey wrench into the agreements and plans of the Mueller prosecutors and the Flynn defense team.</p><p>I think the defense team may have made a minor miscalculation with good intentions. Earlier, they had filed a pleading in which they suggested that Flynn had been ambushed by the FBI. They hadn't read him his were proper rights, etcetera, and the Mueller team pushed back on that and the judge was quite offended by that. He went into that with Flynn and even went so far as to ask the prosecution if it was possible that they could have considered charging Flynn with treason.</p><p>So this quite was stunning for both sides. They took a break and is then decided to ask for a postponement hoping that in the intervening period, over the next weeks, they can do even more cooperation and maybe convince the judge that he really should get no jail time.</p><p>I think the problem is Mueller would not have agreed to the sentencing at this point if they felt there was a lot more cooperation to be done. So I don't really think there's a whole lot more that they can do, that they can hope that the judge calms down a bit and that is probably what they're banking on. In terms of what it means for the President, it seems although it's a black box to us, that Flynn has probably been a very, very helpful cooperator. He was the first man in on the cooperation from Mueller and they have found it to be of substantial assistance to them such that they were agreeing he had no jail time.</p><p>So I think that's really added a lot to the pressures on the President and his team as you were alluding to, there's more and more allegations. I think there are about 17 investigations going on and I think that that pressure is mounting a lot. You really are seeing the strains and the cracks beginning to show.</p><p>RIPLEY: And now you have this lawsuit claiming, a, quote, \"shocking pattern of illegality at President Trump's charity.\" I mean, what does that tell you about the way he's running the White House?</p><p>WU: Yes, it says a lot. And it's really quite, I think distressing for him and his team because he's always tried to draw this line in the sand not to go into his personal businesses and his family, and of course, that charity exactly involves both of those -- his personal business and his family.</p><p>And I think really, disturbingly, you know for America as a country, it really indicates his recklessness and his feeling that he does not need to abide by the rules, and even when you hear the White House statements about this, it always strikes me that they reflect Trump's sort of a second on or third creator's view of what it means to be the American President which is he can just do anything he wants. The President can do anything he wants and that's not true. And the facts and the law are beginning to catch up.</p><p>RIPLEY: And we'll have to see what happens with this unnamed foreign company getting a grand jury subpoena, see if this there's any connection to the Russia investigation. Shan Wu, appreciate your expertise. Thanks for joining us from Washington.</p><p>WU: Nice to see you.</p><p>RIPLEY: Turning now - yes, good to see you too - Russia now though says that it is moving forward with a missile contract for Turkey. This is despite a possible U.S. arms deal. The Kremlin says Moscow intends to sell the Russian made S-400 missile defense system to Ankara even though the U.S. has already approved the sale of rival missile equipment to Turkey. Now this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin, he threatened to beef up security if the U.S. withdraws from a key nuclear treaty.</p><p>So I want to bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen who is following the story for us live in Moscow. Fred, what a mess? How did we get here what does this mean for NATO which is kind of caught in the middle?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I think you're absolutely right. It is certainly a mess right now and the relations between the United States and Russia and it certainly doesn't look as though things are going to get any better anytime soon. Of course, we know that the U.S. was certainly not very happy about Turkey potentially buying those S-400 missile defense systems from the Russians.</p><p>The Russians however, of course, very keen to have that sale go through. All of this, Will, of course, as the relations between the U.S. and Russia continue to get worse, especially after one report after the next comes out in the U.S. outlining the scope and the scale of, for instance, what online trolls did in the United States both before the last Presidential election and afterwards as well.</p><p>Kremlin originally didn't want to comment on that yesterday. They finally did. Here is what they said to us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: An annoyed response from the Kremlin to the Senate report outlining Russian online troll activity against the U.S. both before and after the 2016 Presidential Election. Vladimir Putin's spokesman denying Moscow's involvement.</p><p>[08:20:07]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN: (Through a translator). Somebody is very critical of U.S. social issues and we are blamed for it? What does Russia have to do with this? It's not described. I can only repeat that we once again disagree with this. We think these are totally baseless statements.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: Moscow also engaging in tough military talk against the U.S. In a yearend meeting with his military leaders, Vladimir Putin saying Russia is moving fast to beat the U.S.'s missile defense systems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: (Through a translator). It is necessary to quickly switch over to modern weapons that possess the enhanced capabilities of breaching the advanced missile shield defenses. Next on the agenda are the serial production and the delivery of the avant- garde global range missile complex to the troops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: Earlier this year, Russia announced the development of what it says is a hyper sonic nuclear missile with a global range called avant- garde. Putin's Defense Minister says widespread deployment will begin next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER: (Through a translator). In 2019, the Ministry of Defense is facing a number of defensive tasks which need to be fulfilled. Regarding our strategic nuclear forces, we need to deploy 31 launchers with the intercontinental ballistic missiles, YARs, and avant-garde.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: Tensions between Moscow and Washington are increasing despite President Trump's stated goal of improving relations with Vladimir Putin. The U.S. saying it will pull out of the INF treaty which bans medium range nuclear weapons, claiming Moscow is breaching the agreement. Putin today threatening to deploy new weapons if America abandons the deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PUTIN: (Through a translator). If that, which they keep trying to frighten us with happens, well, we will have to respond accordingly. And as you understand, it won't be too big of a deal to do the appropriate research and development and put them on the ground if necessary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: As the Kremlin continues to lose faith in President Trump's ability to salvage relations between Russia and the U.S., Moscow is beefing up its forces even announcing they will hold strategic nuclear forces drills next year.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: And one of the other areas where they're beefing up their forces, as well, Will, is actually the Arctic and that's a huge area of concern for the United States. The Russians saying just yesterday that they want to finish infrastructure for three sites for air defense systems in the Arctic. That, of course, on top of, for instance, the basis that they're building up there, the air fields that they're building up there, as well. An area where the U.S. is really lagging behind as that relationship between these two important countries continues to sour, Will.</p><p>RIPLEY: Certainly looking and sounding a lot like an arms race. We'll have to see what happens. Fred Pleitgen there, live in Moscow. Thanks very much.</p><p>One of the deadliest ebola outbreaks in history is still spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo. More than 300 people have died from this rare type of fever and ITN's John Ray reports stories that you're hearing on the ground are just heartbreaking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JOHN RAY, CORRESPONDENT, ITN: We are entering the world of ebola where no faint heart dares tread. It is a world of pain and pity. With our camera carried by their medical team and through layers of latex and protective plastic, MSF offers as best it can a human touch and care for the desperately ill.</p><p>It is a highly contagious virus that can strip its victims of dignity. Some arrive already so consumed by ebola that it might be too late to save them. Doctors are trying experimental drugs, untested in clinical trials because there's no alternative. Still, the death rate is more than 50%.</p><p>The world has never been better prepared and armed with a battery of new drugs, better equipped to combat this disease and yet, ebola continues to confound every prediction and every projection. It is still spreading.</p><p>And still killing. A family has gathered to collect a body. Their grief is unrelenting and feelings are running high. We're asked to keep a distance. Instead, we watch as a young boy listens to the weeping and we try to guess what emotions are running through his head. His mother and three brothers have all died. He is more or less alone with his thoughts.</p><p>Since August, this outbreak has rolled through the jungles of Northeast Congo and has now arrived in Butembo, a ramshackle city of a million people.</p><p>[08:25:10]</p><p>RAY: In villages, ebola has passed through, much misery mains. A single tear runs down a child's face as he remembers his mother. He tells me she was preparing his milk when her headaches began. Later, the bleeding started and then swiftly came death. In the nearby city of Beni, Joshua looks over the wall that separates his nursery from his mother who is fighting for her life in the treatment center next door. No one knows if he, too, will succumb. So only those who have survived the disease and cannot be re-infected can touch him.</p><p>I pray to God he doesn't go through the pain I went through, his carer tells me. But there is no happy ending here. Before we leave, we learn Joshua's mother has died. He is now one of hundreds of ebola orphans.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>RIPLEY: That was ITN's John Ray with a very important look at a situation that is not reported about nearly enough. You're watching \"News Stream.\" We'll be right back.</p><p>I'm Will Ripley live in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\", and these are your world headlines. A major breach of the E.U.'s diplomatic communications network first reported by the \"New York Times.\" Cyber security firm, Area 1 discovered the breach and made some of the hacked cables available to the paper. CNN has not had a chance to review the documents, but \"The Time\" says they showed the E.U.'s anxieties about Donald Trump, Russia, Iran and other issues.</p><p>One of America's senior diplomats says the U.S. is considering reviewing the ban that blocks most Americans from traveling to North Korea. Stephen Biegun told reporters in Seoul, the evaluation would take place early next year if conditions are right, and he said, it would allow American aid workers inside North Korea.</p><p>One hundred days to go until Brexit, and five of Britain's leading business groups are warning that time is running out to prevent these severe consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place. The U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal is reached or agreed upon. Defense Secretary says 3,500 troops are also being put on standby.</p><p>The Brexit debate has sparked a controversy over a possible sexism in parliament. We're going to play again those comments from the Prime Minister Theresa May.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>RIPLEY: And I want you to listen to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn at the end of her statement, actually, pay close attention. Watch your screen and see if you can understand what he mouths.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAY: They said they put down a vote of no confidence, then they said they wouldn't. Then they said they would. Then they did it, but it wasn't effective. I know it's the Christmas season and the pantomime season, but what do we see from the Labour front bench and the right Honorable gentleman. He is got to put a confidence vote. Oh, yes, he is. Oh, no, he isn't. I've got some news for him. I've got some advice for the right Honorable gentleman. Look behind you. They're not impressed --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: Did you see his lips right there? Did you catch that? He seemed to call Prime Minister May a stupid woman. At least that's what she believes. And here is how she responded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAY: Can I say to my honorable friend, that I think that everybody in this House, particularly in this 100th year anniversary of women getting the vote, should be aiming to encourage women to come into this claim and to stand in this chamber and should, therefore, use appropriate language in this chamber when they are referring to female members.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: No word on whether Corbyn has apologized or even acknowledged that that is what he said.</p><p>A hard landing for Softbank after one of the world's biggest IPOs, a pretty disappointing start though. Shares in the Japanese mobile telecomm plunged 14.5% in Tokyo after raising an eye-popping 23$.5 billion to investors. This listing is a key part of CEO, Masayoshi Son efforts to reposition his company as a global tech investor.</p><p>Softbank is already a major player, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into technologies that could shape our future. Things like artificial intelligence and robotics. Softbank is not without controversy. It decided to stick with Saudi Arabia as an investment partner despite international outrage over the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. On that note, let's bring in Seijiro Takeshita, he is the former director of Mizumo's equities department. Now, he is a professor joining us live from Shizuoka City in Japan. Good to be with you and thanks for your time tonight.</p><p>SEIJIRO TAKESHITA, PROFESSOR, MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION, UNIVERSITY OF SHIZUOKA: Pleasure, always a pleasure.</p><p>RIPLEY: So what do you make of this dramatic plunge on the first day of this IPO? Should Softbank be discouraged?</p><p>TAKESHITA: Actually, it's bad timing as you know very much for example, the moves in the United States, the equity market is really making a big plunge, and obviously, the Japanese market is well, being dragged in as well. We saw the market drop already 6% this month alone, and basically what we are seeing is a total sellout situation. And this is when they had to make this IPO.</p><p>In addition to that, Softbank had a very, very big problem, a failure of their system on the 6th of December. So basically it was rather bad timing, given a pretty negative image for both of these institutional and private investor in addition to the Saudi Arabia factors that you're talking about.</p><p>RIPLEY: So this massive amount of money that's been raised, where is it going and do you think that the strategy that Masayoshi Son has here is going to pay out in the long run?</p><p>TAKESHITA: Well, it has paid out in the long run many, many times. But I think what the institutional investor constantly is quite aware and afraid about is that this is almost like the musical chair. In other words, Mr. Son had been playing the music very eloquently.</p><p>But everyone is extremely scared when the music will stop because Softbank had been betting very heavily on these new investments and diversification, which worked out fine so far. But the main line of business, the telecommunication in Japan is under a very, very big threat considering the fact that the government is there to pressurize the prize down, to lower the price constantly. In addition, they have got the new competitor, Rockton, coming in addition to the conventional competitors which are very strong, the KDDI and NTT DoCoMo.</p><p>So the environment itself is very, very difficult and the only way that Softbank really its presence is diversification and internationalization.</p><p>RIPLEY: Seijiro Takeshita, I remember the Softbank pepper robot back in 2014 and to think how far things have come since then and where they're headed. It's really extraordinary. We appreciate your time joining us from Japan. Thank you so much.</p><p>Now to Facebook which is facing yet another potential controversy. According to the \"New York Times\" the social networking giant gave other tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Spotify much more access to Facebook user data than it had previously disclosed.</p><p>[08:35:05]</p><p>RIPLEY: \"Time\" says it obtained hundreds of pages of Facebook documents revealing that it allowed some firms to see the names of users' friends, reading private messages and even obtained contact information all without consent. I want to bring in our chief media correspondent, CNN's Brian Stelter who joins me now from New York. I mean, this is just another bad headline for Facebook. What are you hearing, Brian?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes, in a year of bad headlines, and this one is particularly disturbing because it involves what we all think of as our private information on Facebook. Here are some examples on of what is alleged to have been enabled by Facebook. A number of partners that it worked with, big tech companies from Netflix to Spotify to Microsoft were able to access various kinds of Facebook data. Amazon, for example, able to obtain e-mail addresses through friends. Netflix able to read private messages. Yahoo! Able to view real-time feeds of friends' posts. Now, these companies for the most part say they didn't abuse this ability. In some cases, they didn't use it at all.</p><p>Some of these companies say they didn't even know that Facebook had given them this access into people's accounts. But regardless, the point is that Facebook opened the door and left the door open in some cases for years. Now the company is scrambling to respond, trying to down play the significance of this and saying that users, they went ahead, they agreed when they log on to Facebook and when they clicked various boxes to allow partners like Microsoft to make services easier to use.</p><p>But I think the overarching question here is do users really know what's going on when they are on Facebook? Do they realize that they are the product and they are being sold to advertisers? Here's a statement from the company saying in part that they do have to improve communication with the users. The company is saying, \"We know we have got work to do to regain people's trust. Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology and clearer policies and that's what we've been focused on for most of 2018.\"</p><p>Of course, back in March, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke wide open and ever since then, Facebook has been facing a barrage of these negative headlines. The company is facing slow or no user growth and it has a lot of challenges ahead as it tries to convince people that as a responsible user, a responsible site when it comes to private, private data.</p><p>RIPLEY: And you know, you talk to a lot of young people now who consider Facebook old fashioned, which is shocking to me because in college, I didn't even have a Facebook. But nonetheless, troubling trend, right? I'm ageing myself a little bit. Brian Stelter, always appreciate your expertise, live in New York, thank you very much.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks. Thank you.</p><p>RIPLEY: You're watching \"News Stream\" and still to come, a celebrity dog in China may be extending his career on the silver screen forever. All right, we'll tell you how that would have worked. Coming up.</p><p>Elon Musk is calling this a \"eureka\" moment. The tech entrepreneur has debuted his latest visionary project in Los Angeles, an underground loop track. It promises to revolutionize transport in what is often called the most freeway congested city in the U.S. Guests were invited on demo rides using a Tesla electric vehicle traveled around 64 kilometers an hour.</p><p>[08:40:10]</p><p>RIPLEY: Musk is hoping that cars will eventually travel this way in thousands of locations around the world. And in Los Angeles, I'm sure they would take anything to help them beat that horrific traffic there.</p><p>A while back, Hollywood star Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved Coton du Tolear, Samantha for $50,000.00. Now with a similar price tag, you can do the same, at least in China. CNN's Amara Walker introduces us to Juice, a celebrity dog, an ageing celebrity who is about to get perhaps a live long and maybe forever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>AMARA WALKER, ANCHOR, CNN: A rare and unusual operation in a Chinese lab. You're watching scientists extract skin samples from a dog. Part of a procedure to clone the dog, Juice. Famous for starring in Chinese films and television productions.</p><p>Juice adopted off the streets is now nine years old and his career may soon peak. But his owner, He Jun wants him to live on in one form or another.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HE JUN, JUICE's OWNER AND DOG TRAINER: (Through a translator). He has a lot of fans, so he's a piece of intellectual property with social influence. So we want to keep his appearance going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALKER: So a He went on to Sinogene, a Chinese biotech company that specializes in pet cloning. Sinogene came to prominence in 2017 when it announced that it had cloned a beagle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MI JIDONG, CEO, SINOGENE: (Through a translator). We've discovered that more and more pet owners want their pets to accompany them for an even longer period of time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALKER: He paid about $55,000.00 for the procedure and scientists used Juice's skin samples to isolate his DNA and fertilize an egg. The egg was then surgically inserted into a beagle and it was closely monitored during pregnancy. In September, the cloned puppy arrived. Juice's owner is impressed. When we adopted Juice, he said, he looked just like this.</p><p>Experts say the Chinese biotech industry is advancing rapidly. Earlier this year, scientists in Shanghai said they produced the world's first cloned monkeys. One Hong Kong based professor says while there are regulations on the use of animals in the lab, there are no laws that explicitly cover animal cloning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the government side, the image of this cloning industry is really high tech. Definitely our can country is very supportive for those high tech industry because of their high profit margin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALKER: For He Jun, having a replica of his beloved Juice is certainly a dream come true.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\"  Preparing for the worst, the U.K.  and E.U. brace for a no deal Brexit with contingency plans to prevent  chaos.  Sentencing delayed, Trump's former National Security adviser's cozy  plea deal is not looking too cozy anymore.  An IPO flop by Japanese tech  giant Softbank lost billions of dollars on its first day of trading.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with a major hack of the European Union's diplomatic  communications network.  A hack first reported by the \"New York Times\".   The paper says cyber security firm Area 1 found hackers have been  infiltrating the network for years, downloading thousands of cables,  encrypted messages sent on what was meant to be a secure network.  Area 1  made some of those hacked cables available to \"The Times.\"  CNN has not yet  reviewed the documents, but Area 1 has an idea of who might be behind the  hack.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me now live from London the CNN's Samuel Burke.  Samuel, it seems  like these hackers wanted to learn everything they possibly could about  international diplomacy.  What did they find?  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's  incredibly interesting for the past two years, President Trump has brought  a very different style to international relations.  Now, we are finding out  what these diplomats and world leaders think when they walk away from some  of these incredible interactions with the U.S. President.  </p><p>Let's just put on the screen the most sensitive topics that we see in these  cable, starting with Trump's negotiations with China.  President Xi Jinping  quoted as saying working with Trump is like a no rules, free style boxing  match.  But more importantly, Xi reported as saying that Beijing will not  submit to what he calls bullying from the United States, even if the trade  war hurts everybody.  </p><p>Now, when it comes to relationships with Russia, European diplomats  described that meeting between Trump and President Putin in Finland back in  July as successful, at least for Putin, not necessarily for Trump or the  United States.  Perhaps worrying in these cables, Crimea described as a hot  zone where nuclear warheads might have already been deployed.  And even  though the U.S. has pulled out of the Iran deal, cable show European  diplomats requesting to finance exports to Iran to entice that country to  continue complying with the 2015 agreement.  </p><p>Will, I think if you could summarize the most important sentiment here, the  European Union seems to say that there's a negative attitude from President  Trump toward the E.U. and the word they keep on using is that causes a lot  of insecurity.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  It's so fascinating, and there's a reason why these cables are  encrypted.  These are diplomats that supposedly should be able to speak  candidly.  Do we have any idea who these hackers might be and are - is the  E.U. taking steps to prevent this from happening again?  </p><p>BURKE:  Yes, the idea is that they can speak candidly, but certainly  they're not feeling that today.  Let me just also put up on the screen what  we know and don't know about this hack, starting with the fact that that  cyber security firm, Area 1 says these e-mails were accessed using  techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of the China's  People's Liberation Army.  </p><p>But it was just a simple phishing campaign, Will, aimed at diplomats in  Cyprus.  These are e-mails that so many people get you to think it's from  your work, you think it's from your cell phone company.  You click it, put  in your information and it turns out you've handed over your passwords to a  foreign group, and many times, and then they can use that information to  access your accounts or in this case, a much larger system.  </p><p>Now, unlike WikiLeaks, which were high level cables, these are low level  classified documents.  And of course, the hackers didn't publish them.   Very important to mention here that the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs  says this \"New York Times\" report is suspicious, groundless and extremely  irresponsible.  They point out that China has been the victim of hacks,  certainly, something that I hear from tech leaders in the United States,  here in the European Union as well in China, Jack Ma once told me that  Alibaba faces thousands of hacks a day, Will.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Yes, and, of course, the Chinese would never want any candid  conversation that Xi Jinping would have go out in public, especially if  it's any way controversial.  So obviously, they're watching this closely  and we know you are, too.  Samuel Burke, live in London.  Thank you.  </p><p>[08:05:00]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Well there are 100 days to go until Britain is due to leave the  European Union - 100 days.  Not a lot of time.  The Prime Minister Theresa  May has just been telling Parliament that she will reveal the results of  her discussions with the E.U. in January.  Now Britain's leading business  groups, they are warning that time is running out to prevent the severe  consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place.  </p><p>And the U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal  is reached with the European Union.  I want to go to CNN's Anna Stewart who  is live for us in London and has been following all of this.  </p><p>Anna, some are saying that a no deal scenario for Brexit would have  disastrous consequences.  How much of that is scare mongering?  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN:  Yes, and the contingency planning that has  come out in the last 24 hours from the government has also fueled  speculation that what they're doing is scare mongering.  And we've just had  \"Prime Minister Question Time,\" thankfully the last of the year.  I am  sure, Theresa May feels the same as I do.  And I can say how I appreciate  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party later on suggested that she  was scare mongering here.  </p><p>He think that she is essentially trying to run down the clock and make a no  deal Brexit look likely and terrifying so that her Brexit deal is the only  one people will vote for and they will vote for it.  </p><p>Of course, the Prime Minister has refuted that and she also actually took  Jeremy Corbyn to task over his confusing antics this week.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  They said they'd put on a vote of no  confidence; then they said they wouldn't, then they said they would.  Then  they did it, but it wasn't effective.  I know it's the Christmas season and  the pantomime season.  But what we see from the Labour front bench and the  right Honorable gentleman, he is going to put a confidence vote.  Oh, yes,  he is.  Oh, no, he isn't.  I've got some news for him.  I've got some  advice for the right Honorable gentleman.  Look behind you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>STEWART:  Clearly, the Prime Minister likes a bit of panto there.  Now,  what happened this week, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour opposition, it  looked like he was going to bring forth a vote of confidence against the  government, then he failed to do it, bringing one against the Prime  Minister herself which effectively didn't mean much.  It was fairly  meaningless, symbolic, it's not going to get time in Parliament.  </p><p>The smaller parties, Will, just in the last 24 hours have tried to put  forward a confidence vote on the government, but they need Labour to join  them and Labour is not joining them yet.  But this, if it ever happens in  the coming weeks or months, that would essentially pave the way for a new  government to be formed or a snap election.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Anna, if there wasn't so much at stake, it would be quite  entertaining to go watch all of the drama unfold in Parliament.  But, you  know, there's another hot kind of issue that people are talking about.  The  Prime Minister ruled it out this week, but is this second referendum still  a possibility?  </p><p>STEWART:  Well, a second referendum is something the Prime Minister has to  rule out almost every day at the moment.  There is so much chat about it.   Frankly, it does not have the support at this stage that it would need to  happen.  Not within the Labour Party, not within the Conservative Party.   Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, he doesn't want it largely I think  because two-thirds of his MPs are from Brexit areas.  You know, it wouldn't  be electorally not very useful for him to table that.  </p><p>In addition, Will, it takes time, it takes about seven months for the last  referendum in 2016, for the legislation to be passed.  And then you've got  the issue of what on earth would the question be?  Because would it be in  or out like we had last time or would it be hard Brexit, soft Brexit, no  Brexit.  Would it be Norway kind of Brexit, Canada kind of Brexit?  I mean,  there are just so many options.  Parliament can't agree on anything at the  moment.  I can't imagine how that would go down, Will.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  You must be Brex-hausted, Anna Stewart.  I have to steal that line  from you.  You e-mailed me earlier.  I bet you can't wait for Christmas  Break and maybe a little bit of a pause in all of this, but it will pick  right back up.  Anna Stewart, live in London.  Thank you.  </p><p>Coming up on news stream, the Trump organization, the campaign, the  inauguration, the transition, the administration and now, even the  charitable foundation all under investigation.  Yes, the scandals keep  piling up for the U.S. President.  Also, a developing story.  Another hit  for Zimbabwe's Mugabe family.  Authorities are looking to arrest the  deposed leader's wife.  </p><p>[08:10:00]  </p><p>Eleven minutes past 9:00 here in Hong Kong.  It is Wednesday and you're  watching \"News Stream.\"  South African authorities have issued an arrest  warrant for Grace Mugabe, the wife of the deposed Zimbabwean dictator,  Robert Mugabe.  Now, she's accused of assaulting a South African model in  August of last year.  A brutal assault if you believe the model's account  of it all.  </p><p>Now, South Africa is also applying for to Interpol to issue a red notice  which is almost like an international arrest warrant calling for Grace  Mugabe's arrest and extradition.  This story breaking just in the last few  hours.  CNN's Eleni Giokos is live in Johannesburg for us.  This has not  been a great year for Zimbabwe's former First Lady.  </p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes.  It absolutely hasn't, and we know  that the South African police, as you say, have issued that arrest warrant.   What is interesting is that they are working closely with Interpol to try  and force the warrant.  They have applied for a red alert notice.  </p><p>And if that does, in fact, come through, then Zimbabwe will be held  accountable and liable to extradite Mugabe.  Of course, this is going to be  a very delicate situation because of the coup last year where Robert Mugabe  and, of course, the First Lady were ousted out of government by Emmerson  Mnangagwa and what is really important to note here is that Robert Mugabe  and his wife have still be residing in the Presidential Palace.  </p><p>So whether Zimbabwe is going to actually extradite Grace Mugabe is going to  be interesting, but going back to these assault charges, Will, it's  important to note that over the time that it occurred in South Africa,  viral photos were, of course, made massive headlines in the country because  the model had alleged that Mugabe had assaulted her with an electrical  cable that she says had opened her head - open in around three places.  </p><p>And over that time, the South African government had issued Mugabe  diplomatic immunity, even though she was in the country not for diplomatic  purposes, and that is when the prosecutor for the Oscar Pistorius trial  stepped in and decided to represent the model.  Of course that went through  the courts and, of course, we've got the diplomatic immunity that has now  been overturned and we stand here today with an arrest warrant for Grace  Mugabe.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  It will be interesting, though, to see if Zimbabwean authorities  comply.  Eleni Giokos, a lot to watch there and we thank you for your live  report.  Now, to Washington where President Donald Trump is facing more  blows to his already scandal-plagued Presidency.  </p><p>Mr. Trump's charitable foundation, it is now closing its doors amid an  ongoing civil lawsuit over its finances.  Prosecutors say the organization  was less of a charity and more like a personal piggy bank for Mr. Trump and  his three eldest children.  Meanwhile, a judge has ordered a unnamed  foreign company to comply with a grand jury subpoena believed to be from  Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  Now, the Justice Department has asked the  firm to turn over information about its commercial activities.  </p><p>And sentencing has been delayed for the President's former National  Security adviser.  In Tuesday's hearing, Michael Flynn eviscerated Mr.  Trump's claim that he was entrapped by the FBI during the Russia  investigation.  Now, if you remember, Flynn was a top adviser to Donald  Trump on National Security issues.  He resigned from the Trump  administration after he failed to tell the Vice President that he discussed  sanctions with a Russian official.  </p><p>[08:15:05]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  In December of 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to Federal  investigators.  For more on this, let's bring in CNN legal analyst Shan Wu  who is live in Washington.  Shan, let's start with Michael Flynn.  So  despite this humiliating dressing down that he got in court, he's not  backing away from his guilty plea.  He's still cooperating with the Special  Counsel.  So what does that mean for Flynn and also, frankly, for President  Trump?  </p><p>SHAN WU, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN:  For Flynn, this is a second chance.  Judge  Emmet Sullivan really threw a monkey wrench into the agreements and plans  of the Mueller prosecutors and the Flynn defense team.  </p><p>I think the defense team may have made a minor miscalculation with good  intentions.  Earlier, they had filed a pleading in which they suggested  that Flynn had been ambushed by the FBI.  They hadn't read him his were  proper rights, etcetera, and the Mueller team pushed back on that and the  judge was quite offended by that.  He went into that with Flynn and even  went so far as to ask the prosecution if it was possible that they could  have considered charging Flynn with treason.  </p><p>So this quite was stunning for both sides.  They took a break and is then  decided to ask for a postponement hoping that in the intervening period,  over the next weeks, they can do even more cooperation and maybe convince  the judge that he really should get no jail time.  </p><p>I think the problem is Mueller would not have agreed to the sentencing at  this point if they felt there was a lot more cooperation to be done.  So I  don't really think there's a whole lot more that they can do, that they can  hope that the judge calms down a bit and that is probably what they're  banking on.  In terms of what it means for the President, it seems although  it's a black box to us, that Flynn has probably been a very, very helpful  cooperator.  He was the first man in on the cooperation from Mueller and  they have found it to be of substantial assistance to them such that they  were agreeing he had no jail time.  </p><p>So I think that's really added a lot to the pressures on the President and  his team as you were alluding to, there's more and more allegations.  I  think there are about 17 investigations going on and I think that that  pressure is mounting a lot.  You really are seeing the strains and the  cracks beginning to show.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  And now you have this lawsuit claiming, a, quote, \"shocking  pattern of illegality at President Trump's charity.\"  I mean, what does  that tell you about the way he's running the White House?  </p><p>WU:  Yes, it says a lot.  And it's really quite, I think distressing for  him and his team because he's always tried to draw this line in the sand  not to go into his personal businesses and his family, and of course, that  charity exactly involves both of those -- his personal business and his  family.  </p><p>And I think really, disturbingly, you know for America as a country, it  really indicates his recklessness and his feeling that he does not need to  abide by the rules, and even when you hear the White House statements about  this, it always strikes me that they reflect Trump's sort of a second on or  third creator's view of what it means to be the American President which is  he can just do anything he wants.  The President can do anything he wants  and that's not true.  And the facts and the law are beginning to catch up.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  And we'll have to see what happens with this unnamed foreign  company getting a grand jury subpoena, see if this there's any connection  to the Russia investigation.  Shan Wu, appreciate your expertise.  Thanks  for joining us from Washington.  </p><p>WU:  Nice to see you.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Turning now - yes, good to see you too - Russia now though says  that it is moving forward with a missile contract for Turkey.  This is  despite a possible U.S. arms deal.  The Kremlin says Moscow intends to sell  the Russian made S-400 missile defense system to Ankara even though the  U.S. has already approved the sale of rival missile equipment to Turkey.   Now this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin, he threatened to  beef up security if the U.S. withdraws from a key nuclear treaty.  </p><p>So I want to bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen who is following the story for us  live in Moscow.  Fred, what a mess?  How did we get here what does this  mean for NATO which is kind of caught in the middle?  </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  I think you're  absolutely right.  It is certainly a mess right now and the relations  between the United States and Russia and it certainly doesn't look as  though things are going to get any better anytime soon.  Of course, we know  that the U.S. was certainly not very happy about Turkey potentially buying  those S-400 missile defense systems from the Russians.  </p><p>The Russians however, of course, very keen to have that sale go through.   All of this, Will, of course, as the relations between the U.S. and Russia  continue to get worse, especially after one report after the next comes out  in the U.S. outlining the scope and the scale of, for instance, what online  trolls did in the United States both before the last Presidential election  and afterwards as well.  </p><p>Kremlin originally didn't want to comment on that yesterday.  They finally  did.  Here is what they said to us.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  An annoyed response from the Kremlin to the Senate report  outlining Russian online troll activity against the U.S. both before and  after the 2016 Presidential Election.  Vladimir Putin's spokesman denying  Moscow's involvement.  </p><p>[08:20:07]  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN:  (Through a translator).  Somebody is  very critical of U.S. social issues and we are blamed for it?  What does  Russia have to do with this?  It's not described.  I can only repeat that  we once again disagree with this.  We think these are totally baseless  statements.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Moscow also engaging in tough military talk against the U.S.  In  a yearend meeting with his military leaders, Vladimir Putin saying Russia  is moving fast to beat the U.S.'s missile defense systems.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT:  (Through a translator).  It is  necessary to quickly switch over to modern weapons that possess the  enhanced capabilities of breaching the advanced missile shield defenses.   Next on the agenda are the serial production and the delivery of the avant- garde global range missile complex to the troops.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Earlier this year, Russia announced the development of what it  says is a hyper sonic nuclear missile with a global range called avant- garde.  Putin's Defense Minister says widespread deployment will begin next  year.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER:  (Through a translator).    In  2019, the Ministry of Defense is facing a number of defensive tasks which  need to be fulfilled.  Regarding our strategic nuclear forces, we need to  deploy 31 launchers with the intercontinental ballistic missiles, YARs, and  avant-garde.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Tensions between Moscow and Washington are increasing despite  President Trump's stated goal of improving relations with Vladimir Putin.   The U.S. saying it will pull out of the INF treaty which bans medium range  nuclear weapons, claiming Moscow is breaching the agreement.  Putin today  threatening to deploy new weapons if America abandons the deal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PUTIN:  (Through a translator).  If that, which they keep trying to  frighten us with happens, well, we will have to respond accordingly.  And  as you understand, it won't be too big of a deal to do the appropriate  research and development and put them on the ground if necessary.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  As the Kremlin continues to lose faith in President Trump's  ability to salvage relations between Russia and the U.S., Moscow is beefing  up its forces even announcing they will hold strategic nuclear forces  drills next year.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>PLEITGEN:  And one of the other areas where they're beefing up their  forces, as well, Will, is actually the Arctic and that's a huge area of  concern for the United States.  The Russians saying just yesterday that  they want to finish infrastructure for three sites for air defense systems  in the Arctic.  That, of course, on top of, for instance, the basis that  they're building up there, the air fields that they're building up there,  as well.  An area where the U.S. is really lagging behind as that  relationship between these two important countries continues to sour, Will.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Certainly looking and sounding a lot like an arms race.  We'll  have to see what happens.  Fred Pleitgen there, live in Moscow.  Thanks  very much.  </p><p>One of the deadliest ebola outbreaks in history is still spreading in the  Democratic Republic of Congo.  More than 300 people have died from this  rare type of fever and ITN's John Ray reports stories that you're hearing  on the ground are just heartbreaking.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JOHN RAY, CORRESPONDENT, ITN:  We are entering the world of ebola where no  faint heart dares tread.  It is a world of pain and pity.  With our camera  carried by their medical team and through layers of latex and protective  plastic, MSF offers as best it can a human touch and care for the  desperately ill.  </p><p>It is a highly contagious virus that can strip its victims of dignity.   Some arrive already so consumed by ebola that it might be too late to save  them.  Doctors are trying experimental drugs, untested in clinical trials  because there's no alternative.  Still, the death rate is more than 50%.  </p><p>The world has never been better prepared and armed with a battery of new  drugs, better equipped to combat this disease and yet, ebola continues to  confound every prediction and every projection.  It is still spreading.  </p><p>And still killing.  A family has gathered to collect a body.  Their grief  is unrelenting and feelings are running high.  We're asked to keep a  distance.  Instead, we watch as a young boy listens to the weeping and we  try to guess what emotions are running through his head.  His mother and  three brothers have all died.  He is more or less alone with his thoughts.  </p><p>Since August, this outbreak has rolled through the jungles of Northeast  Congo and has now arrived in Butembo, a ramshackle city of a million  people.  </p><p>[08:25:10]  </p><p>RAY:  In villages, ebola has passed through, much misery mains.  A single  tear runs down a child's face as he remembers his mother.  He tells me she  was preparing his milk when her headaches began.  Later, the bleeding  started and then swiftly came death.  In the nearby city of Beni, Joshua  looks over the wall that separates his nursery from his mother who is  fighting for her life in the treatment center next door.  No one knows if  he, too, will succumb.  So only those who have survived the disease and  cannot be re-infected can touch him.  </p><p>I pray to God he doesn't go through the pain I went through, his carer  tells me.  But there is no happy ending here.  Before we leave, we learn  Joshua's mother has died.  He is now one of hundreds of ebola orphans.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>RIPLEY:  That was ITN's John Ray with a very important look at a situation  that is not reported about nearly enough.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"   We'll be right back.  </p><p>I'm Will Ripley live in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News Stream\", and  these are your world headlines.  A major breach of the E.U.'s diplomatic  communications network first reported by the \"New York Times.\"  Cyber  security firm, Area 1 discovered the breach and made some of the hacked  cables available to the paper.  CNN has not had a chance to review the  documents, but \"The Time\" says they showed the E.U.'s anxieties about  Donald Trump, Russia, Iran and other issues.  </p><p>One of America's senior diplomats says the U.S. is considering reviewing  the ban that blocks most Americans from traveling to North Korea.  Stephen  Biegun told reporters in Seoul, the evaluation would take place early next  year if conditions are right, and he said, it would allow American aid  workers inside North Korea.  </p><p>One hundred days to go until Brexit, and five of Britain's leading business  groups are warning that time is running out to prevent these severe  consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place.   The U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal is  reached or agreed upon.  Defense Secretary says 3,500 troops are also being  put on standby.  </p><p>The Brexit debate has sparked a controversy over a possible sexism in  parliament.  We're going to play again those comments from the Prime  Minister Theresa May.  </p><p>[08:30:00]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  And I want you to listen to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn at  the end of her statement, actually, pay close attention.  Watch your screen  and see if you can understand what he mouths.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAY:  They said they put down a vote of no confidence, then they said they  wouldn't.  Then they said they would.  Then they did it, but it wasn't  effective.  I know it's the Christmas season and the pantomime season, but  what do we see from the Labour front bench and the right Honorable  gentleman.  He is got to put a confidence vote.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, no,  he isn't.  I've got some news for him.  I've got some advice for the right  Honorable gentleman.  Look behind you.  They're not impressed --  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Did you see his lips right there?  Did you catch that?  He seemed  to call Prime Minister May a stupid woman.  At least that's what she  believes.  And here is how she responded.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAY:  Can I say to my honorable friend, that I think that everybody in this  House, particularly in this 100th year anniversary of women getting the  vote, should be aiming to encourage women to come into this claim and to  stand in this chamber and should, therefore, use appropriate language in  this chamber when they are referring to female members.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RIPLEY:  No word on whether Corbyn has apologized or even acknowledged that  that is what he said.  </p><p>A hard landing for Softbank after one of the world's biggest IPOs, a pretty  disappointing start though.  Shares in the Japanese mobile telecomm plunged  14.5% in Tokyo after raising an eye-popping 23$.5 billion to investors.   This listing is a key part of CEO, Masayoshi Son efforts to reposition his  company as a global tech investor.  </p><p>Softbank is already a major player, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars  into technologies that could shape our future.  Things like artificial  intelligence and robotics.  Softbank is not without controversy.  It  decided to stick with Saudi Arabia as an investment partner despite  international outrage over the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.   On that note, let's bring in Seijiro Takeshita, he is the former director  of Mizumo's equities department.  Now, he is a professor joining us live  from Shizuoka City in Japan.  Good to be with you and thanks for your time  tonight.  </p><p>SEIJIRO TAKESHITA, PROFESSOR, MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION, UNIVERSITY OF  SHIZUOKA:  Pleasure, always a pleasure.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  So what do you make of this dramatic plunge on the first day of  this IPO?  Should Softbank be discouraged?  </p><p>TAKESHITA:  Actually, it's bad timing as you know very much for example,  the moves in the United States, the equity market is really making a big  plunge, and obviously, the Japanese market is well, being dragged in as  well.  We saw the market drop already 6% this month alone, and basically  what we are seeing is a total sellout situation. And this is when they had  to make this IPO.  </p><p>In addition to that, Softbank had a very, very big problem, a failure of  their system on the 6th of December.  So basically it was rather bad  timing, given a pretty negative image for both of these institutional and  private investor in addition to the Saudi Arabia factors that you're  talking about.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  So this massive amount of money that's been raised, where is it  going and do you think that the strategy that Masayoshi Son has here is  going to pay out in the long run?  </p><p>TAKESHITA:  Well, it has paid out in the long run many, many times.  But I  think what the institutional investor constantly is quite aware and afraid  about is that this is almost like the musical chair.  In other words, Mr.  Son had been playing the music very eloquently.  </p><p>But everyone is extremely scared when the music will stop because Softbank  had been betting very heavily on these new investments and diversification,  which worked out fine so far.  But the main line of business, the  telecommunication in Japan is under a very, very big threat considering the  fact that the government is there to pressurize the prize down, to lower  the price constantly.  In addition, they have got the new competitor,  Rockton, coming in addition to the conventional competitors which are very  strong, the KDDI and NTT DoCoMo.  </p><p>So the environment itself is very, very difficult and the only way that  Softbank really its presence is diversification and internationalization.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Seijiro Takeshita, I remember the Softbank pepper robot back in  2014 and to think how far things have come since then and where they're  headed.  It's really extraordinary.  We appreciate your time joining us  from Japan.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Now to Facebook which is facing yet another potential controversy.   According to the \"New York Times\" the social networking giant gave other  tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Spotify much more access to  Facebook user data than it had previously disclosed.  </p><p>[08:35:05]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  \"Time\" says it obtained hundreds of pages of Facebook documents  revealing that it allowed some firms to see the names of users' friends,  reading private messages and even obtained contact information all without  consent.  I want to bring in our chief media correspondent, CNN's Brian  Stelter who joins me now from New York.  I mean, this is just another bad  headline for Facebook.  What are you hearing, Brian?  </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, in a year of bad  headlines, and this one is particularly disturbing because it involves what  we all think of as our private information on Facebook.  Here are some  examples on of what is alleged to have been enabled by Facebook.  A number  of partners that it worked with, big tech companies from Netflix to Spotify  to Microsoft were able to access various kinds of Facebook data.  Amazon,  for example, able to obtain e-mail addresses through friends.  Netflix able  to read private messages.  Yahoo! Able to view real-time feeds of friends'  posts.  Now, these companies for the most part say they didn't abuse this  ability.  In some cases, they didn't use it at all.  </p><p>Some of these companies say they didn't even know that Facebook had given  them this access into people's accounts.  But regardless, the point is that  Facebook opened the door and left the door open in some cases for years.   Now the company is scrambling to respond, trying to down play the  significance of this and saying that users, they went ahead, they agreed  when they log on to Facebook and when they clicked various boxes to allow  partners like Microsoft to make services easier to use.  </p><p>But I think the overarching question here is do users really know what's  going on when they are on Facebook?  Do they realize that they are the  product and they are being sold to advertisers?  Here's a statement from  the company saying in part that they do have to improve communication with  the users.  The company is saying, \"We know we have got work to do to  regain people's trust.  Protecting people's information requires stronger  teams, better technology and clearer policies and that's what we've been  focused on for most of 2018.\"  </p><p>Of course, back in March, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke wide open  and ever since then, Facebook has been facing a barrage of these negative  headlines.  The company is facing slow or no user growth and it has a lot  of challenges ahead as it tries to convince people that as a responsible  user, a responsible site when it comes to private, private data.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  And you know, you talk to a lot of young people now who consider  Facebook old fashioned, which is shocking to me because in college, I  didn't even have a Facebook.  But nonetheless, troubling trend, right?  I'm  ageing myself a little bit.  Brian Stelter, always appreciate your  expertise, live in New York, thank you very much.  </p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.  Thank you.  </p><p>RIPLEY:  You're watching \"News Stream\" and still to come, a celebrity dog  in China may be extending his career on the silver screen forever.  All  right, we'll tell you how that would have worked.  Coming up.  </p><p>Elon Musk is calling this a \"eureka\" moment.  The tech entrepreneur has  debuted his latest visionary project in Los Angeles, an underground loop  track.  It promises to revolutionize transport in what is often called the  most freeway congested city in the U.S.  Guests were invited on demo rides  using a Tesla electric vehicle traveled around 64 kilometers an hour.  </p><p>[08:40:10]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  Musk is hoping that cars will eventually travel this way in  thousands of locations around the world.  And in Los Angeles, I'm sure they  would take anything to help them beat that horrific traffic there.  </p><p>A while back, Hollywood star Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved Coton du  Tolear, Samantha for $50,000.00.  Now with a similar price tag, you can do  the same, at least in China.  CNN's Amara Walker introduces us to Juice, a  celebrity dog, an ageing celebrity who is about to get perhaps a live long  and maybe forever.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>AMARA WALKER, ANCHOR, CNN:  A rare and unusual operation in a Chinese lab.   You're watching scientists extract skin samples from a dog.  Part of a  procedure to clone the dog, Juice.  Famous for starring in Chinese films  and television productions.  </p><p>Juice adopted off the streets is now nine years old and his career may soon  peak.  But his owner, He Jun wants him to live on in one form or another.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HE JUN, JUICE's OWNER AND DOG TRAINER:  (Through a translator).  He has a  lot of fans, so he's a piece of intellectual  property with social  influence.  So we want to keep his appearance going forward.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALKER:  So a He went on to Sinogene, a Chinese biotech company that  specializes in pet cloning.  Sinogene came to prominence in 2017 when it  announced that it had cloned a beagle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MI JIDONG, CEO, SINOGENE:  (Through a translator).  We've discovered that  more and more pet owners want their pets to accompany them for an even  longer period of time.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALKER:  He paid about $55,000.00 for the procedure and scientists used  Juice's skin samples to isolate his DNA and fertilize an egg.  The egg was  then surgically inserted into a beagle and it was closely monitored during  pregnancy.  In September, the cloned puppy arrived.  Juice's owner is  impressed.  When we adopted Juice, he said, he looked just like this.  </p><p>Experts say the Chinese biotech industry is advancing rapidly.  Earlier  this year, scientists in Shanghai said they produced the world's first  cloned monkeys.  One Hong Kong based professor says while there are  regulations on the use of animals in the lab, there are no laws that  explicitly cover animal cloning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the government side, the image of this cloning  industry is really high tech.  Definitely our can country is very  supportive for those high tech industry because of their high profit  margin.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALKER:  For He Jun, having a replica of his beloved Juice is certainly a  dream come true.  Amara Walker, CNN.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>RIPLEY:  They may look the same, but you can't clone a personality.  That  is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Will Ripley.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\"  Preparing for the worst, the U.K.  and E.U. brace for a no deal Brexit with contingency plans to prevent  chaos.  Sentencing delayed, Trump's former National Security adviser's cozy  plea deal is not looking too cozy anymore.  An IPO flop by Japanese tech  giant Softbank lost billions of dollars on its first day of trading.  </p><p> We begin with a major hack of the European Union's diplomatic  communications network.  A hack first reported by the \"New York Times\".   The paper says cyber security firm Area 1 found hackers have been  infiltrating the network for years, downloading thousands of cables,  encrypted messages sent on what was meant to be a secure network.  Area 1  made some of those hacked cables available to \"The Times.\"  CNN has not yet  reviewed the documents, but Area 1 has an idea of who might be behind the  hack.  </p><p> Joining me now live from London the CNN's Samuel Burke.  Samuel, it seems  like these hackers wanted to learn everything they possibly could about  international diplomacy.  What did they find?  </p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's  incredibly interesting for the past two years, President Trump has brought  a very different style to international relations.  Now, we are finding out  what these diplomats and world leaders think when they walk away from some  of these incredible interactions with the U.S. President.  </p><p> Let's just put on the screen the most sensitive topics that we see in these  cable, starting with Trump's negotiations with China.  President Xi Jinping  quoted as saying working with Trump is like a no rules, free style boxing  match.  But more importantly, Xi reported as saying that Beijing will not  submit to what he calls bullying from the United States, even if the trade  war hurts everybody.  </p><p> Now, when it comes to relationships with Russia, European diplomats  described that meeting between Trump and President Putin in Finland back in  July as successful, at least for Putin, not necessarily for Trump or the  United States.  Perhaps worrying in these cables, Crimea described as a hot  zone where nuclear warheads might have already been deployed.  And even  though the U.S. has pulled out of the Iran deal, cable show European  diplomats requesting to finance exports to Iran to entice that country to  continue complying with the 2015 agreement.  </p><p> Will, I think if you could summarize the most important sentiment here, the  European Union seems to say that there's a negative attitude from President  Trump toward the E.U. and the word they keep on using is that causes a lot  of insecurity.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  It's so fascinating, and there's a reason why these cables are  encrypted.  These are diplomats that supposedly should be able to speak  candidly.  Do we have any idea who these hackers might be and are - is the  E.U. taking steps to prevent this from happening again?  </p><p> BURKE:  Yes, the idea is that they can speak candidly, but certainly  they're not feeling that today.  Let me just also put up on the screen what  we know and don't know about this hack, starting with the fact that that  cyber security firm, Area 1 says these e-mails were accessed using  techniques resembling those long used by an elite unit of the China's  People's Liberation Army.  </p><p> But it was just a simple phishing campaign, Will, aimed at diplomats in  Cyprus.  These are e-mails that so many people get you to think it's from  your work, you think it's from your cell phone company.  You click it, put  in your information and it turns out you've handed over your passwords to a  foreign group, and many times, and then they can use that information to  access your accounts or in this case, a much larger system.  </p><p> Now, unlike WikiLeaks, which were high level cables, these are low level  classified documents.  And of course, the hackers didn't publish them.   Very important to mention here that the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs  says this \"New York Times\" report is suspicious, groundless and extremely  irresponsible.  They point out that China has been the victim of hacks,  certainly, something that I hear from tech leaders in the United States,  here in the European Union as well in China, Jack Ma once told me that  Alibaba faces thousands of hacks a day, Will.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Yes, and, of course, the Chinese would never want any candid  conversation that Xi Jinping would have go out in public, especially if  it's any way controversial.  So obviously, they're watching this closely  and we know you are, too.  Samuel Burke, live in London.  Thank you.  </p><p> [08:05:00]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Well there are 100 days to go until Britain is due to leave the  European Union - 100 days.  Not a lot of time.  The Prime Minister Theresa  May has just been telling Parliament that she will reveal the results of  her discussions with the E.U. in January.  Now Britain's leading business  groups, they are warning that time is running out to prevent the severe  consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place.  </p><p> And the U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal  is reached with the European Union.  I want to go to CNN's Anna Stewart who  is live for us in London and has been following all of this.  </p><p> Anna, some are saying that a no deal scenario for Brexit would have  disastrous consequences.  How much of that is scare mongering?  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, REPORTER, CNN:  Yes, and the contingency planning that has  come out in the last 24 hours from the government has also fueled  speculation that what they're doing is scare mongering.  And we've just had  \"Prime Minister Question Time,\" thankfully the last of the year.  I am  sure, Theresa May feels the same as I do.  And I can say how I appreciate  Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party later on suggested that she  was scare mongering here.  </p><p> He think that she is essentially trying to run down the clock and make a no  deal Brexit look likely and terrifying so that her Brexit deal is the only  one people will vote for and they will vote for it.  </p><p> Of course, the Prime Minister has refuted that and she also actually took  Jeremy Corbyn to task over his confusing antics this week.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  They said they'd put on a vote of no  confidence; then they said they wouldn't, then they said they would.  Then  they did it, but it wasn't effective.  I know it's the Christmas season and  the pantomime season.  But what we see from the Labour front bench and the  right Honorable gentleman, he is going to put a confidence vote.  Oh, yes,  he is.  Oh, no, he isn't.  I've got some news for him.  I've got some  advice for the right Honorable gentleman.  Look behind you.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> STEWART:  Clearly, the Prime Minister likes a bit of panto there.  Now,  what happened this week, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour opposition, it  looked like he was going to bring forth a vote of confidence against the  government, then he failed to do it, bringing one against the Prime  Minister herself which effectively didn't mean much.  It was fairly  meaningless, symbolic, it's not going to get time in Parliament.  </p><p> The smaller parties, Will, just in the last 24 hours have tried to put  forward a confidence vote on the government, but they need Labour to join  them and Labour is not joining them yet.  But this, if it ever happens in  the coming weeks or months, that would essentially pave the way for a new  government to be formed or a snap election.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Anna, if there wasn't so much at stake, it would be quite  entertaining to go watch all of the drama unfold in Parliament.  But, you  know, there's another hot kind of issue that people are talking about.  The  Prime Minister ruled it out this week, but is this second referendum still  a possibility?  </p><p> STEWART:  Well, a second referendum is something the Prime Minister has to  rule out almost every day at the moment.  There is so much chat about it.   Frankly, it does not have the support at this stage that it would need to  happen.  Not within the Labour Party, not within the Conservative Party.   Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, he doesn't want it largely I think  because two-thirds of his MPs are from Brexit areas.  You know, it wouldn't  be electorally not very useful for him to table that.  </p><p> In addition, Will, it takes time, it takes about seven months for the last  referendum in 2016, for the legislation to be passed.  And then you've got  the issue of what on earth would the question be?  Because would it be in  or out like we had last time or would it be hard Brexit, soft Brexit, no  Brexit.  Would it be Norway kind of Brexit, Canada kind of Brexit?  I mean,  there are just so many options.  Parliament can't agree on anything at the  moment.  I can't imagine how that would go down, Will.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  You must be Brex-hausted, Anna Stewart.  I have to steal that line  from you.  You e-mailed me earlier.  I bet you can't wait for Christmas  Break and maybe a little bit of a pause in all of this, but it will pick  right back up.  Anna Stewart, live in London.  Thank you.  </p><p> Coming up on news stream, the Trump organization, the campaign, the  inauguration, the transition, the administration and now, even the  charitable foundation all under investigation.  Yes, the scandals keep  piling up for the U.S. President.  Also, a developing story.  Another hit  for Zimbabwe's Mugabe family.  Authorities are looking to arrest the  deposed leader's wife.  </p><p> [08:10:00]  </p><p> Eleven minutes past 9:00 here in Hong Kong.  It is Wednesday and you're  watching \"News Stream.\"  South African authorities have issued an arrest  warrant for Grace Mugabe, the wife of the deposed Zimbabwean dictator,  Robert Mugabe.  Now, she's accused of assaulting a South African model in  August of last year.  A brutal assault if you believe the model's account  of it all.  </p><p> Now, South Africa is also applying for to Interpol to issue a red notice  which is almost like an international arrest warrant calling for Grace  Mugabe's arrest and extradition.  This story breaking just in the last few  hours.  CNN's Eleni Giokos is live in Johannesburg for us.  This has not  been a great year for Zimbabwe's former First Lady.  </p><p> ELENI GIOKOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes.  It absolutely hasn't, and we know  that the South African police, as you say, have issued that arrest warrant.   What is interesting is that they are working closely with Interpol to try  and force the warrant.  They have applied for a red alert notice.  </p><p> And if that does, in fact, come through, then Zimbabwe will be held  accountable and liable to extradite Mugabe.  Of course, this is going to be  a very delicate situation because of the coup last year where Robert Mugabe  and, of course, the First Lady were ousted out of government by Emmerson  Mnangagwa and what is really important to note here is that Robert Mugabe  and his wife have still be residing in the Presidential Palace.  </p><p> So whether Zimbabwe is going to actually extradite Grace Mugabe is going to  be interesting, but going back to these assault charges, Will, it's  important to note that over the time that it occurred in South Africa,  viral photos were, of course, made massive headlines in the country because  the model had alleged that Mugabe had assaulted her with an electrical  cable that she says had opened her head - open in around three places.  </p><p> And over that time, the South African government had issued Mugabe  diplomatic immunity, even though she was in the country not for diplomatic  purposes, and that is when the prosecutor for the Oscar Pistorius trial  stepped in and decided to represent the model.  Of course that went through  the courts and, of course, we've got the diplomatic immunity that has now  been overturned and we stand here today with an arrest warrant for Grace  Mugabe.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  It will be interesting, though, to see if Zimbabwean authorities  comply.  Eleni Giokos, a lot to watch there and we thank you for your live  report.  Now, to Washington where President Donald Trump is facing more  blows to his already scandal-plagued Presidency.  </p><p> Mr. Trump's charitable foundation, it is now closing its doors amid an  ongoing civil lawsuit over its finances.  Prosecutors say the organization  was less of a charity and more like a personal piggy bank for Mr. Trump and  his three eldest children.  Meanwhile, a judge has ordered a unnamed  foreign company to comply with a grand jury subpoena believed to be from  Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  Now, the Justice Department has asked the  firm to turn over information about its commercial activities.  </p><p> And sentencing has been delayed for the President's former National  Security adviser.  In Tuesday's hearing, Michael Flynn eviscerated Mr.  Trump's claim that he was entrapped by the FBI during the Russia  investigation.  Now, if you remember, Flynn was a top adviser to Donald  Trump on National Security issues.  He resigned from the Trump  administration after he failed to tell the Vice President that he discussed  sanctions with a Russian official.  </p><p> [08:15:05]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  In December of 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to Federal  investigators.  For more on this, let's bring in CNN legal analyst Shan Wu  who is live in Washington.  Shan, let's start with Michael Flynn.  So  despite this humiliating dressing down that he got in court, he's not  backing away from his guilty plea.  He's still cooperating with the Special  Counsel.  So what does that mean for Flynn and also, frankly, for President  Trump?  </p><p> SHAN WU, LEGAL ANALYST, CNN:  For Flynn, this is a second chance.  Judge  Emmet Sullivan really threw a monkey wrench into the agreements and plans  of the Mueller prosecutors and the Flynn defense team.  </p><p> I think the defense team may have made a minor miscalculation with good  intentions.  Earlier, they had filed a pleading in which they suggested  that Flynn had been ambushed by the FBI.  They hadn't read him his were  proper rights, etcetera, and the Mueller team pushed back on that and the  judge was quite offended by that.  He went into that with Flynn and even  went so far as to ask the prosecution if it was possible that they could  have considered charging Flynn with treason.  </p><p> So this quite was stunning for both sides.  They took a break and is then  decided to ask for a postponement hoping that in the intervening period,  over the next weeks, they can do even more cooperation and maybe convince  the judge that he really should get no jail time.  </p><p> I think the problem is Mueller would not have agreed to the sentencing at  this point if they felt there was a lot more cooperation to be done.  So I  don't really think there's a whole lot more that they can do, that they can  hope that the judge calms down a bit and that is probably what they're  banking on.  In terms of what it means for the President, it seems although  it's a black box to us, that Flynn has probably been a very, very helpful  cooperator.  He was the first man in on the cooperation from Mueller and  they have found it to be of substantial assistance to them such that they  were agreeing he had no jail time.  </p><p> So I think that's really added a lot to the pressures on the President and  his team as you were alluding to, there's more and more allegations.  I  think there are about 17 investigations going on and I think that that  pressure is mounting a lot.  You really are seeing the strains and the  cracks beginning to show.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  And now you have this lawsuit claiming, a, quote, \"shocking  pattern of illegality at President Trump's charity.\"  I mean, what does  that tell you about the way he's running the White House?  </p><p> WU:  Yes, it says a lot.  And it's really quite, I think distressing for  him and his team because he's always tried to draw this line in the sand  not to go into his personal businesses and his family, and of course, that  charity exactly involves both of those -- his personal business and his  family.  </p><p> And I think really, disturbingly, you know for America as a country, it  really indicates his recklessness and his feeling that he does not need to  abide by the rules, and even when you hear the White House statements about  this, it always strikes me that they reflect Trump's sort of a second on or  third creator's view of what it means to be the American President which is  he can just do anything he wants.  The President can do anything he wants  and that's not true.  And the facts and the law are beginning to catch up.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  And we'll have to see what happens with this unnamed foreign  company getting a grand jury subpoena, see if this there's any connection  to the Russia investigation.  Shan Wu, appreciate your expertise.  Thanks  for joining us from Washington.  </p><p> WU:  Nice to see you.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Turning now - yes, good to see you too - Russia now though says  that it is moving forward with a missile contract for Turkey.  This is  despite a possible U.S. arms deal.  The Kremlin says Moscow intends to sell  the Russian made S-400 missile defense system to Ankara even though the  U.S. has already approved the sale of rival missile equipment to Turkey.   Now this comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin, he threatened to  beef up security if the U.S. withdraws from a key nuclear treaty.  </p><p> So I want to bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen who is following the story for us  live in Moscow.  Fred, what a mess?  How did we get here what does this  mean for NATO which is kind of caught in the middle?  </p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  I think you're  absolutely right.  It is certainly a mess right now and the relations  between the United States and Russia and it certainly doesn't look as  though things are going to get any better anytime soon.  Of course, we know  that the U.S. was certainly not very happy about Turkey potentially buying  those S-400 missile defense systems from the Russians.  </p><p> The Russians however, of course, very keen to have that sale go through.   All of this, Will, of course, as the relations between the U.S. and Russia  continue to get worse, especially after one report after the next comes out  in the U.S. outlining the scope and the scale of, for instance, what online  trolls did in the United States both before the last Presidential election  and afterwards as well.  </p><p> Kremlin originally didn't want to comment on that yesterday.  They finally  did.  Here is what they said to us.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  An annoyed response from the Kremlin to the Senate report  outlining Russian online troll activity against the U.S. both before and  after the 2016 Presidential Election.  Vladimir Putin's spokesman denying  Moscow's involvement.  </p><p> [08:20:07]  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN:  (Through a translator).  Somebody is  very critical of U.S. social issues and we are blamed for it?  What does  Russia have to do with this?  It's not described.  I can only repeat that  we once again disagree with this.  We think these are totally baseless  statements.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  Moscow also engaging in tough military talk against the U.S.  In  a yearend meeting with his military leaders, Vladimir Putin saying Russia  is moving fast to beat the U.S.'s missile defense systems.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT:  (Through a translator).  It is  necessary to quickly switch over to modern weapons that possess the  enhanced capabilities of breaching the advanced missile shield defenses.   Next on the agenda are the serial production and the delivery of the avant- garde global range missile complex to the troops.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  Earlier this year, Russia announced the development of what it  says is a hyper sonic nuclear missile with a global range called avant- garde.  Putin's Defense Minister says widespread deployment will begin next  year.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER:  (Through a translator).    In  2019, the Ministry of Defense is facing a number of defensive tasks which  need to be fulfilled.  Regarding our strategic nuclear forces, we need to  deploy 31 launchers with the intercontinental ballistic missiles, YARs, and  avant-garde.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  Tensions between Moscow and Washington are increasing despite  President Trump's stated goal of improving relations with Vladimir Putin.   The U.S. saying it will pull out of the INF treaty which bans medium range  nuclear weapons, claiming Moscow is breaching the agreement.  Putin today  threatening to deploy new weapons if America abandons the deal.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PUTIN:  (Through a translator).  If that, which they keep trying to  frighten us with happens, well, we will have to respond accordingly.  And  as you understand, it won't be too big of a deal to do the appropriate  research and development and put them on the ground if necessary.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  As the Kremlin continues to lose faith in President Trump's  ability to salvage relations between Russia and the U.S., Moscow is beefing  up its forces even announcing they will hold strategic nuclear forces  drills next year.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  And one of the other areas where they're beefing up their  forces, as well, Will, is actually the Arctic and that's a huge area of  concern for the United States.  The Russians saying just yesterday that  they want to finish infrastructure for three sites for air defense systems  in the Arctic.  That, of course, on top of, for instance, the basis that  they're building up there, the air fields that they're building up there,  as well.  An area where the U.S. is really lagging behind as that  relationship between these two important countries continues to sour, Will.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Certainly looking and sounding a lot like an arms race.  We'll  have to see what happens.  Fred Pleitgen there, live in Moscow.  Thanks  very much.  </p><p> One of the deadliest ebola outbreaks in history is still spreading in the  Democratic Republic of Congo.  More than 300 people have died from this  rare type of fever and ITN's John Ray reports stories that you're hearing  on the ground are just heartbreaking.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JOHN RAY, CORRESPONDENT, ITN:  We are entering the world of ebola where no  faint heart dares tread.  It is a world of pain and pity.  With our camera  carried by their medical team and through layers of latex and protective  plastic, MSF offers as best it can a human touch and care for the  desperately ill.  </p><p> It is a highly contagious virus that can strip its victims of dignity.   Some arrive already so consumed by ebola that it might be too late to save  them.  Doctors are trying experimental drugs, untested in clinical trials  because there's no alternative.  Still, the death rate is more than 50%.  </p><p> The world has never been better prepared and armed with a battery of new  drugs, better equipped to combat this disease and yet, ebola continues to  confound every prediction and every projection.  It is still spreading.  </p><p> And still killing.  A family has gathered to collect a body.  Their grief  is unrelenting and feelings are running high.  We're asked to keep a  distance.  Instead, we watch as a young boy listens to the weeping and we  try to guess what emotions are running through his head.  His mother and  three brothers have all died.  He is more or less alone with his thoughts.  </p><p> Since August, this outbreak has rolled through the jungles of Northeast  Congo and has now arrived in Butembo, a ramshackle city of a million  people.  </p><p> [08:25:10]  </p><p> RAY:  In villages, ebola has passed through, much misery mains.  A single  tear runs down a child's face as he remembers his mother.  He tells me she  was preparing his milk when her headaches began.  Later, the bleeding  started and then swiftly came death.  In the nearby city of Beni, Joshua  looks over the wall that separates his nursery from his mother who is  fighting for her life in the treatment center next door.  No one knows if  he, too, will succumb.  So only those who have survived the disease and  cannot be re-infected can touch him.  </p><p> I pray to God he doesn't go through the pain I went through, his carer  tells me.  But there is no happy ending here.  Before we leave, we learn  Joshua's mother has died.  He is now one of hundreds of ebola orphans.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> RIPLEY:  That was ITN's John Ray with a very important look at a situation  that is not reported about nearly enough.  You're watching \"News Stream.\"   We'll be right back.  </p><p> I'm Will Ripley live in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News Stream\", and  these are your world headlines.  A major breach of the E.U.'s diplomatic  communications network first reported by the \"New York Times.\"  Cyber  security firm, Area 1 discovered the breach and made some of the hacked  cables available to the paper.  CNN has not had a chance to review the  documents, but \"The Time\" says they showed the E.U.'s anxieties about  Donald Trump, Russia, Iran and other issues.  </p><p> One of America's senior diplomats says the U.S. is considering reviewing  the ban that blocks most Americans from traveling to North Korea.  Stephen  Biegun told reporters in Seoul, the evaluation would take place early next  year if conditions are right, and he said, it would allow American aid  workers inside North Korea.  </p><p> One hundred days to go until Brexit, and five of Britain's leading business  groups are warning that time is running out to prevent these severe  consequences of Britain crashing out of the E.U. with no deal in place.   The U.K. government says it is speeding up preparations in case no deal is  reached or agreed upon.  Defense Secretary says 3,500 troops are also being  put on standby.  </p><p> The Brexit debate has sparked a controversy over a possible sexism in  parliament.  We're going to play again those comments from the Prime  Minister Theresa May.  </p><p> [08:30:00]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  And I want you to listen to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn at  the end of her statement, actually, pay close attention.  Watch your screen  and see if you can understand what he mouths.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAY:  They said they put down a vote of no confidence, then they said they  wouldn't.  Then they said they would.  Then they did it, but it wasn't  effective.  I know it's the Christmas season and the pantomime season, but  what do we see from the Labour front bench and the right Honorable  gentleman.  He is got to put a confidence vote.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, no,  he isn't.  I've got some news for him.  I've got some advice for the right  Honorable gentleman.  Look behind you.  They're not impressed --  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Did you see his lips right there?  Did you catch that?  He seemed  to call Prime Minister May a stupid woman.  At least that's what she  believes.  And here is how she responded.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAY:  Can I say to my honorable friend, that I think that everybody in this  House, particularly in this 100th year anniversary of women getting the  vote, should be aiming to encourage women to come into this claim and to  stand in this chamber and should, therefore, use appropriate language in  this chamber when they are referring to female members.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RIPLEY:  No word on whether Corbyn has apologized or even acknowledged that  that is what he said.  </p><p> A hard landing for Softbank after one of the world's biggest IPOs, a pretty  disappointing start though.  Shares in the Japanese mobile telecomm plunged  14.5% in Tokyo after raising an eye-popping 23$.5 billion to investors.   This listing is a key part of CEO, Masayoshi Son efforts to reposition his  company as a global tech investor.  </p><p>Softbank is already a major player, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars  into technologies that could shape our future.  Things like artificial  intelligence and robotics.  Softbank is not without controversy.  It  decided to stick with Saudi Arabia as an investment partner despite  international outrage over the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.   On that note, let's bring in Seijiro Takeshita, he is the former director  of Mizumo's equities department.  Now, he is a professor joining us live  from Shizuoka City in Japan.  Good to be with you and thanks for your time  tonight.  </p><p> SEIJIRO TAKESHITA, PROFESSOR, MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION, UNIVERSITY OF  SHIZUOKA:  Pleasure, always a pleasure.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  So what do you make of this dramatic plunge on the first day of  this IPO?  Should Softbank be discouraged?  </p><p> TAKESHITA:  Actually, it's bad timing as you know very much for example,  the moves in the United States, the equity market is really making a big  plunge, and obviously, the Japanese market is well, being dragged in as  well.  We saw the market drop already 6% this month alone, and basically  what we are seeing is a total sellout situation. And this is when they had  to make this IPO.  </p><p> In addition to that, Softbank had a very, very big problem, a failure of  their system on the 6th of December.  So basically it was rather bad  timing, given a pretty negative image for both of these institutional and  private investor in addition to the Saudi Arabia factors that you're  talking about.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  So this massive amount of money that's been raised, where is it  going and do you think that the strategy that Masayoshi Son has here is  going to pay out in the long run?  </p><p> TAKESHITA:  Well, it has paid out in the long run many, many times.  But I  think what the institutional investor constantly is quite aware and afraid  about is that this is almost like the musical chair.  In other words, Mr.  Son had been playing the music very eloquently.  </p><p> But everyone is extremely scared when the music will stop because Softbank  had been betting very heavily on these new investments and diversification,  which worked out fine so far.  But the main line of business, the  telecommunication in Japan is under a very, very big threat considering the  fact that the government is there to pressurize the prize down, to lower  the price constantly.  In addition, they have got the new competitor,  Rockton, coming in addition to the conventional competitors which are very  strong, the KDDI and NTT DoCoMo.  </p><p> So the environment itself is very, very difficult and the only way that  Softbank really its presence is diversification and internationalization.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Seijiro Takeshita, I remember the Softbank pepper robot back in  2014 and to think how far things have come since then and where they're  headed.  It's really extraordinary.  We appreciate your time joining us  from Japan.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> Now to Facebook which is facing yet another potential controversy.   According to the \"New York Times\" the social networking giant gave other  tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Spotify much more access to  Facebook user data than it had previously disclosed.  </p><p> [08:35:05]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  \"Time\" says it obtained hundreds of pages of Facebook documents  revealing that it allowed some firms to see the names of users' friends,  reading private messages and even obtained contact information all without  consent.  I want to bring in our chief media correspondent, CNN's Brian  Stelter who joins me now from New York.  I mean, this is just another bad  headline for Facebook.  What are you hearing, Brian?  </p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, in a year of bad  headlines, and this one is particularly disturbing because it involves what  we all think of as our private information on Facebook.  Here are some  examples on of what is alleged to have been enabled by Facebook.  A number  of partners that it worked with, big tech companies from Netflix to Spotify  to Microsoft were able to access various kinds of Facebook data.  Amazon,  for example, able to obtain e-mail addresses through friends.  Netflix able  to read private messages.  Yahoo! Able to view real-time feeds of friends'  posts.  Now, these companies for the most part say they didn't abuse this  ability.  In some cases, they didn't use it at all.  </p><p> Some of these companies say they didn't even know that Facebook had given  them this access into people's accounts.  But regardless, the point is that  Facebook opened the door and left the door open in some cases for years.   Now the company is scrambling to respond, trying to down play the  significance of this and saying that users, they went ahead, they agreed  when they log on to Facebook and when they clicked various boxes to allow  partners like Microsoft to make services easier to use.  </p><p> But I think the overarching question here is do users really know what's  going on when they are on Facebook?  Do they realize that they are the  product and they are being sold to advertisers?  Here's a statement from  the company saying in part that they do have to improve communication with  the users.  The company is saying, \"We know we have got work to do to  regain people's trust.  Protecting people's information requires stronger  teams, better technology and clearer policies and that's what we've been  focused on for most of 2018.\"  </p><p> Of course, back in March, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke wide open  and ever since then, Facebook has been facing a barrage of these negative  headlines.  The company is facing slow or no user growth and it has a lot  of challenges ahead as it tries to convince people that as a responsible  user, a responsible site when it comes to private, private data.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  And you know, you talk to a lot of young people now who consider  Facebook old fashioned, which is shocking to me because in college, I  didn't even have a Facebook.  But nonetheless, troubling trend, right?  I'm  ageing myself a little bit.  Brian Stelter, always appreciate your  expertise, live in New York, thank you very much.  </p><p> STELTER:  Thanks.  Thank you.  </p><p> RIPLEY:  You're watching \"News Stream\" and still to come, a celebrity dog  in China may be extending his career on the silver screen forever.  All  right, we'll tell you how that would have worked.  Coming up.  </p><p> Elon Musk is calling this a \"eureka\" moment.  The tech entrepreneur has  debuted his latest visionary project in Los Angeles, an underground loop  track.  It promises to revolutionize transport in what is often called the  most freeway congested city in the U.S.  Guests were invited on demo rides  using a Tesla electric vehicle traveled around 64 kilometers an hour.  </p><p> [08:40:10]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  Musk is hoping that cars will eventually travel this way in  thousands of locations around the world.  And in Los Angeles, I'm sure they  would take anything to help them beat that horrific traffic there.  </p><p> A while back, Hollywood star Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved Coton du  Tolear, Samantha for $50,000.00.  Now with a similar price tag, you can do  the same, at least in China.  CNN's Amara Walker introduces us to Juice, a  celebrity dog, an ageing celebrity who is about to get perhaps a live long  and maybe forever.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> AMARA WALKER, ANCHOR, CNN:  A rare and unusual operation in a Chinese lab.   You're watching scientists extract skin samples from a dog.  Part of a  procedure to clone the dog, Juice.  Famous for starring in Chinese films  and television productions.  </p><p> Juice adopted off the streets is now nine years old and his career may soon  peak.  But his owner, He Jun wants him to live on in one form or another.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HE JUN, JUICE's OWNER AND DOG TRAINER:  (Through a translator).  He has a  lot of fans, so he's a piece of intellectual  property with social  influence.  So we want to keep his appearance going forward.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALKER:  So a He went on to Sinogene, a Chinese biotech company that  specializes in pet cloning.  Sinogene came to prominence in 2017 when it  announced that it had cloned a beagle.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MI JIDONG, CEO, SINOGENE:  (Through a translator).  We've discovered that  more and more pet owners want their pets to accompany them for an even  longer period of time.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALKER:  He paid about $55,000.00 for the procedure and scientists used  Juice's skin samples to isolate his DNA and fertilize an egg.  The egg was  then surgically inserted into a beagle and it was closely monitored during  pregnancy.  In September, the cloned puppy arrived.  Juice's owner is  impressed.  When we adopted Juice, he said, he looked just like this.  </p><p> Experts say the Chinese biotech industry is advancing rapidly.  Earlier  this year, scientists in Shanghai said they produced the world's first  cloned monkeys.  One Hong Kong based professor says while there are  regulations on the use of animals in the lab, there are no laws that  explicitly cover animal cloning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the government side, the image of this cloning  industry is really high tech.  Definitely our can country is very  supportive for those high tech industry because of their high profit  margin.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALKER:  For He Jun, having a replica of his beloved Juice is certainly a  dream come true.  Amara Walker, CNN.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> RIPLEY:  They may look the same, but you can't clone a personality.  That  is \"News Stream.\"  I'm Will Ripley.

Google's high-profile acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion last year, mainly for its portfolio of 17,000 granted patents and 6,800 patents pending, illustrates how important IPR isin the modern technology sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ownership of IPR is only one part of what investors look for in a tech business. They want to know that the valuable assets lie with the business, but, more importantly, that the company's IPR is not going to be challenged. An investor will want the funds he invests to help grow the business and give him a decent return, not be swallowed bylitigation costs. This is becoming more and more of a risk, as various recent disputes between big tech players like Google, Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo, Samsung and Apple demonstrate. As Joshua Walker (Chairman of Lex Machina, which compiles and analyses data on intellectual property litigation) commented in the Economist at the end of last year, \"this really is the first global patent war\" (Economist, 19 December 2011).</p><p>In addition, technology companies are especially at risk from the increasingly aggressive approaches taken by so-called 'patent trolls', entities which exist solely to hold patents and use the threat of litigation to extract profitable licence fees in respect of these.</p><p>In this article, Adam Kuan and Peter Dalton consider what steps a technology company reliant on key IPR should take to maximise the value of its assets and ensure that its IP portfolio is best presented to potential investors. We have assumed a company structure, although these issues would equally apply to sole trader or partnership structures.</p><p>1) Identify the IP used by the company</p><p>The first step is to identify the IPR used by the company. This may not always be as easy as it sounds, especially in the case of unregistered IPR (i.e. IPR not registered with a national registry such asthe UK's Intellectual Property Office) if records have not been keptup to date.</p><p>As a guideline, the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of the IPR we might expect to a company to own:</p><p>&gt; In particular you should seek to identify the core asset of the company, and whether this is adequately protected by relevant IPR. For example, the company may have developed a particular piece of software which generates the majority of the company's revenue and value.Whilst investors or buyers will want to know about all of the IP owned by the company, they will be particularly concerned about the IPR protection afforded to core assets. They will want assurance that allcore IP which is capable of being registered has been registered (orhas pending applications for registration) in all key jurisdictions in which the company operates (or intends to operate in the future). Any challenges to the subsistence of IP in core assets, or to the validity of registered IPR, may be critical to whether the transaction goes ahead.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You will need to be able to identify the unregistered and registered IPR used by the company;</p><p>Core assets are particularly important and investors will want to see that these are adequately protected.</p><p>2) Establish ownership of IPR</p><p>Some IPR is likely to be owned by third parties, and licensed by the company (see section 4 below). For IPR owned by the company, investors and buyers will want to see evidence that the company is the proper owner.</p><p>a) Registered IPR</p><p>In respect of Registered IPR, it should be relatively easy to showthat the company is the owner. You will need to make sure that the company is recorded as the owner of the registered IPR in all relevantnational registries. In many cases it will be possible to obtain such evidence from the website of the registry in question, although in some jurisdictions the company may have to rely on a paper certificate. If IPR has previously been transferred to the company, ensure thatthere is a formal written agreement assigning the relevant rights and that this change of ownership is recorded in the relevant national registries.</p><p>b) Unregistered IPR</p><p>With unregistered IPR, there may be no single document which proves ownership. You will need to show a chain of ownership from the original creator of the IPR which shows that the company is now the proper owner.</p><p>You will therefore need to identify the original creator; as a general rule, work created by an employee is in the course of employmentbelongs to the employer, not the employee. However, a buyer or investor will often want to see contracts of employment with that employeeto ensure that there is nothing contradictory in those employment contracts which could displace this presumption. Generally it is best to have a specific clause in those contracts which sets out that IPR produced during the course of the employment belongs to the employer.</p><p>This presumption does not apply to work produced by third party contractors. Here the default position is that IPR belongs to the contractor, not the party which commissioned the work. The commissioning party will often simply have a licence to use the work in question (although the terms of such a licence will not be clear). It will therefore be necessary to show that the contract of work contained a clauseby which the contractor assigned all IPR in the work to the company.If you cannot show this, any buyer or investor may require the company to obtain such an assignment from the contractor.</p><p>If you have purchased or otherwise obtained unregistered IPR underan assignment from a third party, you may need to show that the assignor was the proper owner of the unregistered IPR when it was assigned to the company. Investors / buyers may be satisfied if the documentassigning the IPR contained a warranty to that effect given by the assignor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Showing ownership of registered IPR will generally be relatively easy, as the registration documents should show ownership.</p><p>For unregistered IPR you will need to show the IPR passed from theoriginal creator to the company. This may involve producing contracts governing the creation of the IPR.</p><p>IPR produced by an employee in the course of employment is owned by the employer, however in the absence of written agreement to the contrary, IPR produced by a contractor is owned by that contractor, notthe party commissioning the work. These presumptions can be displaced, most often by terms in the employment or contractor contract.</p><p>3) Third party challenges</p><p>Buyers or investors will want to know the extent of any allegations that the company's IPR infringes third party rights (this includes applications to invalidate, cancel, revoke or modify registered IPR) or that the IPR is otherwise not capable of protection. They will also want to know about any infringement allegations made by the companyagainst third parties. If the company is involved in litigation which could threaten the company's ability to use a core piece of IPR in the future, this is likely to be a serious stumbling block for any investor or buyer.</p><p>It is also likely that you will be asked to disclose what checks have been made to ensure that such risks do not exist in the immediatefuture. For example, were searches undertaken when trade marks were registered to ensure that there were not similar marks registered which could be used to challenge the registration. Or when entering a new market, were freedom to market searches undertaken to look for patents which might exist in that area. Registered IPR can still be challenged by pre-existing IPR holders, even if no complaint was raised when the registration was originally made; such searches and checks will help satisfy buyers / investors that the registration is secure.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Investors or buyers will want to know:</p><p>whether there have been any allegations of IP infringement by or against the company;</p><p>whether there have been any challenges to the validity or subsistence of the company's IPR; and</p><p>what checks as to the existence of third party rights have been made.</p><p>4) Licences</p><p>Licences in</p><p>You will need to consider what IPR your company licenses in from third parties. Buyers or investors will want to know that your companyhas valid licences to use any third party IPR which it needs. This will be especially important if your core products or services incorporate such third party IPR. If your company uses third party IPR on aninformal basis, you should consider putting in place formal written licences with proper commercial terms.</p><p>Whilst some licences will be clearly marked in individual licence documents, other documents may also contain licences which are not immediately clear; for example, research and development, collaboration, trade mark co-existence agreements and IT Services Agreements couldall incorporate some form of IPR licence.</p><p>You should also be aware of the terms of licences and whether theycontain onerous provisions or represent areas of risk for the business of the company. For example, overly high royalty rates, uncapped indemnities given by the company, or abilities of the licensor to terminate at will and thus remove the company's right to use the subject of the licence. Buyers and investors are likely to request copies of licences, certainly in respect of core products or services, and you will need to be able to justify any questionable terms.</p><p>Licences out</p><p>You will also need to be able to identify any licences of IPR which your company has given and provide copies of these. Buyers and investors will want to be sure that such licences are in the company's interests and give it adequate protection in respect of the licensee'suse of the licensed IPR. As well as any formal licences, you should consider whether the company has given any informal permissions to third parties to use IPR. These may need to be formalised in written licences.</p><p>General considerations</p><p>It will also be important to consider whether any licences (in or out) contain change control provisions which could be triggered by the proposed transaction; if so, these licences may need to be varied to ensure they continue after the transaction has taken place.</p><p>You will also be required to identify any material breaches of licences which have occurred or have been alleged, again either by or against the company.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You will need to be able to identify that the company has a formallicence of any IPR needed by the business, and that such licences donot contain overly onerous terms and will not be jeopardised by the proposed transaction or by any other situation in the immediate future.</p><p>Buyers and investors will also want to see the terms of any licences of the company's IPR to third parties, to ensure that these are onappropriate commercial terms.</p><p>5) Open Source Software</p><p>The presence of open source software (OSS) in a target company's products was once considered a potential deal breaker. This is no longer the case as OSS has become more mainstream; however, especially where the company in question is a software provider, buyers or investors will want to satisfy themselves that the use of OSS in the companyor its products does not compromise the business of the company.</p><p>Questions which are likely to be asked include:</p><p>Where the OSS originates from;</p><p>What the OSS does;</p><p>Where or how the OSS is being used and re-used internally or distributed externally;</p><p>The terms of OSS licences and whether there are conditions on use;for example a requirement that any distribution includes copyright notices or attributions or (more importantly) that the source code must be made available if a derivative work is created and distributed.</p><p>In general the use of OSS is unlikely to be a major issue, especially if such OSS is licensed under permissive licences such as MIT or BSD. Where OSS is governed by restrictive licences (especially those containing 'copyleft' provisions which require source code of derivative works to be made available to the public) this is likely to be okas long as the software in question is only used internally and is not distributed outside the company (either in isolation or as part ofa wider product). However, care must be exercised where products / services containing OSS licensed under restrictive licences (such as the GPL) are distributed to third parties, where this could give rise to a risk that source code in proprietary software must be disclosed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Buyers and investors generally understand that it is sometimes appropriate to use OSS.</p><p>However, you must be able to adequately document your company's use of OSS to ensure that the use does not present any risks to the company.</p><p>In particular, investors or buyers will want to know that the company is in compliance with any OSS licences, and that no licence posesa risk to the business model (for example by imposing 'copyleft' provisions on proprietary software owned by the company which might require the source code to be disclosed).</p><p>6) Encumbrances, confidential information and competition</p><p>Encumbrances</p><p>A buyer or investor will want to know whether any of your company's IPR is secured against lending, as this would reduce the value of that IPR to the company in the event of a sale. In the case of registered IPR, such encumbrances may be registered on the register.</p><p>Confidential Information</p><p>You may need to show that the company has put in place adequate protections to protect its confidential information. You may also be required to provide a schedule of such information. You will also need to identify any breaches of confidentiality which have taken place orhave been alleged, either by or against the company.</p><p>You may also be required to provide a schedule of obligations of confidence owed to third parties in respect of third party confidential information in the hands of the company.</p><p>Competition</p><p>Technology or software companies are often at risk of falling foulof competition law where their market share is such that they can besaid to be in a dominant position. Smaller companies are not immune if the market they operate in is defined narrowly by the relevant competition regulator.</p><p>In such a situation, business practices which are deemed 'anti-competitive', such as excessive pricing, price fixing, or bundling of products, can be prohibited. Regulators can even force dominant companies to licence industry standard technology to their competitors in order to encourage competition.</p><p>You may therefore be asked to provide evidence of the company's market share in its particular market, and also evidence as to whether any competition issues have been raised in the past. Buyers or investors may also wish to scrutinise licences or agreements with third parties relating to the company's IPR, to see if these contain anti-competitive terms which could be challenged.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You will need to identify IPR which is secured against debts; thiswill reduce the value of the IPR in the eyes of the investor / buyer.</p><p>The company's confidential information is also an important IPR ofthe company which you will need to show is properly recorded and protected.</p><p>If your company is in a dominant position in the market, regulators could restrict certain 'anti-competitive' business practices and even require industry standard IPR to be licensed to competitors. You will need to be able to demonstrate to a buyer or seller how likely itis that the company is in such a position, and if so whether its activities could be deemed 'anti-competitive'.</p><p>Comment</p><p>Investors or buyers will require evidence that the target company has a strategy in place for properly protecting its intellectual property assets. Whilst this likely to be especially important where the company operates in the technology or digital sectors, it is increasingly something which will be expected of all companies regardless of the sector in which they operate.</p><p>It is important therefore to be able to demonstrate at the outset of a potential transaction that IPR is being pro-actively managed, protected and enforced, with a clear view of the importance of IPR to the overall business strategy of the company. This will help to ensurethat no issues with IPR are encountered down the line, and also helpdemonstrate that the company is well managed and potentially a good prospect for investment or purchase.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guideto the subject matter.

Google's high-profile acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion last year, mainly for its portfolio of 17,000 granted patents and 6,800 patents pending, illustrates how important IPR is in the modern technology sector.</p><p><br/><br/>Ownership of IPR is only one part of what investors look for in a tech business. They want to know that the valuable assets lie with the business, but, more importantly, that the company's IPR is not going to be challenged. An investor will want the funds he invests to help grow the business and give him a decent return, not be swallowed by litigation costs. This is becoming more and more of a risk, as various recent disputes between big tech players like Google, Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo, Samsung and Apple demonstrate. As Joshua Walker (Chairman of Lex Machina, which compiles and analyses data on intellectual property litigation) commented in the Economist at the end of last year, \"this really is the first global patent war\" (Economist, 19 December 2011).<br/><br/>In addition, technology companies are especially at risk from the increasingly aggressive approaches taken by so-called 'patent trolls', entities which exist solely to hold patents and use the threat of litigation to extract profitable licence fees in respect of these.\u00a0<br/><br/>In this article, Adam Kuan and Peter Dalton consider what steps a technology company reliant on key IPR should take to maximise the value of its assets and ensure that its IP portfolio is best presented to potential investors. We have assumed a company structure, although these issues would equally apply to sole trader or partnership structures.<br/><br/>1)\u00a0Identify the IP used by the company<br/><br/>The first step is to identify the IPR used by the company. This may not always be as easy as it sounds, especially in the case of unregistered IPR (i.e. IPR not registered with a national registry such as the UK's Intellectual Property Office) if records have not been kept up to date. <br/><br/>As a guideline, the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of the IPR we might expect to a company to own:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In particular you should seek to identify the core asset of the company, and whether this is adequately protected by relevant IPR. For example, the company may have developed a particular piece of software which generates the majority of the company's revenue and value. Whilst investors or buyers will want to know about all of the IP owned by the company, they will be particularly concerned about the IPR protection afforded to core assets. They will want assurance that all core IP which is capable of being registered has been registered (or has pending applications for registration) in all key jurisdictions in which the company operates (or intends to operate in the future). Any challenges to the subsistence of IP in core assets, or to the validity of registered IPR, may be critical to whether the transaction goes ahead.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/> You will need to be able to identify the unregistered and registered IPR used by the company;<br/>Core assets are particularly important and investors will want to see that these are adequately protected.<br/>2)\u00a0Establish ownership of IPR<br/><br/>Some IPR is likely to be owned by third parties, and licensed by the company (see section 4 below). For IPR owned by the company, investors and buyers will want to see evidence that the company is the proper owner.<br/><br/>a) Registered IPR<br/><br/>In respect of Registered IPR, it should be relatively easy to show that the company is the owner. You will need to make sure that the company is recorded as the owner of the registered IPR in all relevant national registries. In many cases it will be possible to obtain such evidence from the website of the registry in question, although in some jurisdictions the company may have to rely on a paper certificate. If IPR has previously been transferred to the company, ensure that there is a formal written agreement assigning the relevant rights and that this change of ownership is recorded in the relevant national registries.<br/><br/>b)\u00a0Unregistered IPR<br/><br/>With unregistered IPR, there may be no single document which proves ownership. You will need to show a chain of ownership from the original creator of the IPR which shows that the company is now the proper owner.<br/><br/>You will therefore need to identify the original creator; as a general rule, work created by an employee is in the course of employment belongs to the employer, not the employee. However, a buyer or investor will often want to see contracts of employment with that employee to ensure that there is nothing contradictory in those employment contracts which could displace this presumption. Generally it is best to have a specific clause in those contracts which sets out that IPR produced during the course of the employment belongs to the employer.<br/><br/>This presumption does not apply to work produced by third party contractors. Here the default position is that IPR belongs to the contractor, not the party which commissioned the work. The commissioning party will often simply have a licence to use the work in question (although the terms of such a licence will not be clear). It will therefore be necessary to show that the contract of work contained a clause by which the contractor assigned all IPR in the work to the company. If you cannot show this, any buyer or investor may require the company to obtain such an assignment from the contractor. <br/><br/>If you have purchased or otherwise obtained unregistered IPR under an assignment from a third party, you may need to show that the assignor was the proper owner of the unregistered IPR when it was assigned to the company. Investors / buyers may be satisfied if the document assigning the IPR contained a warranty to that effect given by the assignor.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/> Showing ownership of registered IPR will generally be relatively easy, as the registration documents should show ownership.<br/>For unregistered IPR you will need to show the IPR passed from the original creator to the company. This may involve producing contracts governing the creation of the IPR.<br/>IPR produced by an employee in the course of employment is owned by the employer, however in the absence of written agreement to the contrary, IPR produced by a contractor is owned by that contractor, not the party commissioning the work. These presumptions can be displaced, most often by terms in the employment or contractor contract.<br/>3) Third party challenges<br/><br/>Buyers or investors will want to know the extent of any allegations that the company's IPR infringes third party rights (this includes applications to invalidate, cancel, revoke or modify registered IPR) or that the IPR is otherwise not capable of protection. They will also want to know about any infringement allegations made by the company against third parties. If the company is involved in litigation which could threaten the company's ability to use a core piece of IPR in the future, this is likely to be a serious stumbling block for any investor or buyer.\u00a0<br/><br/>It is also likely that you will be asked to disclose what checks have been made to ensure that such risks do not exist in the immediate future. For example, were searches undertaken when trade marks were registered to ensure that there were not similar marks registered which could be used to challenge the registration. Or when entering a new market, were freedom to market searches undertaken to look for patents which might exist in that area. Registered IPR can still be challenged by pre-existing IPR holders, even if no complaint was raised when the registration was originally made; such searches and checks will help satisfy buyers / investors that the registration is secure.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>Investors or buyers will want to know:<br/> whether there have been any allegations of IP infringement by or against the company;<br/>whether there have been any challenges to the validity or subsistence of the company's IPR; and<br/>what checks as to the existence of third party rights have been made.<br/>4) Licences<br/><br/>Licences in<br/><br/>You will need to consider what IPR your company licenses in from third parties. Buyers or investors will want to know that your company has valid licences to use any third party IPR which it needs. This will be especially important if your core products or services incorporate such third party IPR. If your company uses third party IPR on an informal basis, you should consider putting in place formal written licences with proper commercial terms.<br/><br/>Whilst some licences will be clearly marked in individual licence documents, other documents may also contain licences which are not immediately clear; for example, research and development, collaboration, trade mark co-existence agreements and IT Services Agreements could all incorporate some form of IPR licence.<br/><br/>You should also be aware of the terms of licences and whether they contain onerous provisions or represent areas of risk for the business of the company. For example, overly high royalty rates, uncapped indemnities given by the company, or abilities of the licensor to terminate at will and thus remove the company's right to use the subject of the licence. Buyers and investors are likely to request copies of licences, certainly in respect of core products or services, and you will need to be able to justify any questionable terms.<br/><br/>Licences out<br/><br/>You will also need to be able to identify any licences of IPR which your company has given and provide copies of these. Buyers and investors will want to be sure that such licences are in the company's interests and give it adequate protection in respect of the licensee's use of the licensed IPR. As well as any formal licences, you should consider whether the company has given any informal permissions to third parties to use IPR. These may need to be formalised in written licences.<br/><br/>General considerations<br/><br/>It will also be important to consider whether any licences (in or out) contain change control provisions which could be triggered by the proposed transaction; if so, these licences may need to be varied to ensure they continue after the transaction has taken place.<br/><br/>You will also be required to identify any material breaches of licences which have occurred or have been alleged, again either by or against the company.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/> You will need to be able to identify that the company has a formal licence of any IPR needed by the business, and that such licences do not contain overly onerous terms and will not be jeopardised by the proposed transaction or by any other situation in the immediate future.<br/>Buyers and investors will also want to see the terms of any licences of the company's IPR to third parties, to ensure that these are on appropriate commercial terms.<br/>5) Open Source Software<br/><br/>The presence of open source software (OSS) in a target company's products was once considered a potential deal breaker. This is no longer the case as OSS has become more mainstream; however, especially where the company in question is a software provider, buyers or investors will want to satisfy themselves that the use of OSS in the company or its products does not compromise the business of the company.<br/><br/>Questions which are likely to be asked include:<br/> Where the OSS originates from;<br/>What the OSS does;<br/>Where or how the OSS is being used and re-used internally or distributed externally;<br/>The terms of OSS licences and whether there are conditions on use; for example a requirement that any distribution includes copyright notices or attributions or (more importantly) that the source code must be made available if a derivative work is created and distributed.<br/>In general the use of OSS is unlikely to be a major issue, especially if such OSS is licensed under permissive licences such as MIT or BSD. Where OSS is governed by restrictive licences (especially those containing 'copyleft' provisions which require source code of derivative works to be made available to the public) this is likely to be ok as long as the software in question is only used internally and is not distributed outside the company (either in isolation or as part of a wider product). However, care must be exercised where products / services containing OSS licensed under restrictive licences (such as the GPL) are distributed to third parties, where this could give rise to a risk that source code in proprietary software must be disclosed.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/> Buyers and investors generally understand that it is sometimes appropriate to use OSS.<br/>However, you must be able to adequately document your company's use of OSS to ensure that the use does not present any risks to the company.<br/>In particular, investors or buyers will want to know that the company is in compliance with any OSS licences, and that no licence poses a risk to the business model (for example by imposing 'copyleft' provisions on proprietary software owned by the company which might require the source code to be disclosed).<br/>6)\u00a0Encumbrances, confidential information and competition<br/><br/>Encumbrances<br/><br/>A buyer or investor will want to know whether any of your company's IPR is secured against lending, as this would reduce the value of that IPR to the company in the event of a sale. In the case of registered IPR, such encumbrances may be registered on the register.<br/><br/>Confidential Information<br/><br/>You may need to show that the company has put in place adequate protections to protect its confidential information. You may also be required to provide a schedule of such information. You will also need to identify any breaches of confidentiality which have taken place or have been alleged, either by or against the company.<br/><br/>You may also be required to provide a schedule of obligations of confidence owed to third parties in respect of third party confidential information in the hands of the company.<br/><br/>Competition<br/><br/>Technology or software companies are often at risk of falling foul of competition law where their market share is such that they can be said to be in a dominant position. Smaller companies are not immune if the market they operate in is defined narrowly by the relevant competition regulator.<br/><br/>In such a situation, business practices which are deemed 'anti-competitive', such as excessive pricing, price fixing, or bundling of products, can be prohibited. Regulators can even force dominant companies to licence industry standard technology to their competitors in order to encourage competition.<br/><br/>You may therefore be asked to provide evidence of the company's market share in its particular market, and also evidence as to whether any competition issues have been raised in the past. Buyers or investors may also wish to scrutinise licences or agreements with third parties relating to the company's IPR, to see if these contain anti-competitive terms which could be challenged.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/> You will need to identify IPR which is secured against debts; this will reduce the value of the IPR in the eyes of the investor / buyer.<br/>The company's confidential information is also an important IPR of the company which you will need to show is properly recorded and protected.<br/>If your company is in a dominant position in the market, regulators could restrict certain 'anti-competitive' business practices and even require industry standard IPR to be licensed to competitors. You will need to be able to demonstrate to a buyer or seller how likely it is that the company is in such a position, and if so whether its activities could be deemed 'anti-competitive'.<br/>Comment<br/><br/>Investors or buyers will require evidence that the target company has a strategy in place for properly protecting its intellectual property assets. Whilst this likely to be especially important where the company operates in the technology or digital sectors, it is increasingly something which will be expected of all companies regardless of the sector in which they operate.<br/><br/>It is important therefore to be able to demonstrate at the outset of a potential transaction that IPR is being pro-actively managed, protected and enforced, with a clear view of the importance of IPR to the overall business strategy of the company. This will help to ensure that no issues with IPR are encountered down the line, and also help demonstrate that the company is well managed and potentially a good prospect for investment or purchase.<br/><br/>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

His talk of integrating humans and ...</p><p>Elon Musk, purveyor of electric cars and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower\"> flame-throwers</url>, has sometimes been compared to a Bond villain. His talk of integrating humans and microchips does little to dispel the bad boy image. Mr Musk has invested\u00a0more than $100m in\u00a0 Neuralink, a company experimenting with brain implants. But he is not alone: companies and governments around the world are betting on the marriage of machine and mind.</p><p>A report from Britain\u2019s\u00a0 Royal Society this week predicted those efforts will pave the way for a cybernetic future. Before humanity can reach that goal though, it sees two\u00a0big challenges. Integrating complex electronic systems with organic wiring may be the simpler of the two. Developing policy for computer-brain interaction, when the ramifications are unclear, is even more of a challenge. It is nevertheless vital to try to mitigate the risks ahead.</p><p>Most work on neural implants focuses on their medical capabilities, and potential to transform healthcare. The\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/ihuman/report-neural-interfaces.pdf\"> report\u00a0</url>envisions that human creativity combined with immense computing power could radically change other areas of life as well. Workers in hazardous conditions could remotely control robots. Virtual reality experiences could reach a new level, beaming images directly to our minds. Thoughts could be wordlessly shared over a combined network, giving humanity something approaching telepathy.</p><p>While many of these possibilities are years away, the Royal Society is right to argue that the process for assessing possible pitfalls should begin now. After these devices are embedded in society (and surgically implanted in human brains), it will be far harder to reverse course. The risks are varied. Neural implants which make the users smarter but which are only accessible to the wealthy could further entrench inequality, creating a permanent \u201caugmented\u201d elite. Connecting human brains to a network could, in theory, give marketers, political campaigners and even employers access to individuals\u2019 thoughts and emotions. There is even the prospect that malicious actors could hack implants, leaving victims little more than\u00a0 ghosts in their shells.</p><p>The business side of neural interfaces also presents challenges. The fact that Facebook and Alphabet are already studying the technology creates the danger of power being further concentrated in the hands of a few companies. Product lifespans are another cause for concern. It is unclear what will happen to the firmware inside users\u2019 heads if companies go bust. Customers might need to\u00a0have new implants installed every time a product update is released.</p><p>Several of the Royal Society\u2019s proposals for ensuring that neural implants are developed safely are well worth putting into practice. The first is that international frameworks, not Big Tech, should govern the development and policy of neural implants. The tech\u00a0 giants\u2019 dominance\u00a0 in other fields has already left regulators on the back foot.\u00a0</p><p>Public dialogue is vital too. The people who will have to live with the new reality should have a say in navigating its ethical and societal risks. Finally, these debates should not be restricted to a one-off process. As technologies evolve, so must norms and regulations.</p><p>William Gibson\u2019s seminal novel\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Neuromancer</emphasis> turned 35 this year. Its imagined future, where humans would enter cyber space merely by sticking cables into their brains, may come to pass before it reaches 70. That is cause for both hope, and some fear.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Neuromancer</emphasis> envisioned a society where cybernetically enhanced and genetically augmented superhumans were the norm. For those without upgrades, life would be nasty, brutish and short.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-46272692d55011e9a0bdab8ec6435630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1X-2T51-JB77-K2VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><timeReceived>4:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is Monday, June 17th. We are coming to you live from the Cannes Lions conference and it is 7 A.M. on the East Coast. Your top stories right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are pointing to a slightly higher opening this morning for the broader averages. Take a look. Dow Industrial's holding onto a point, S&amp;P's also up a point and the Nasdaq up 8.5. I should point out that this is off of the best levels of the morning in terms of futures. We will keep watching that. It is a big week where the Federal Reserve will have a two- day meeting. Friday, markets ended the day down slightly, but they were up for the week. As you see, the Dow was down 17 on Friday, the S&amp;P was down 4 and the Nasdaq lower by 40 points.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this. European markets today are mixed. FT 100's down 9.5, CAC quarante in Paris is up 10 and the DAX index in Germany down one point. In Asia overnightm markets were mostly higher with the exception of Korea, but here too very much fractional moves across the board. In Hong Kong, government offices are closed today following the massive protests in the streets yesterday. We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>Meanwhile, big technology in focus. The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, says that tech giants need to take responsibility for the chaos that they create. Plus, Facebook takes action against Huawei this morning. Coming up, Connell McShane is live from China. He is on the ground in China with an inside look at Huawei and the troubles that the company is facing today. That's coming up, 8:30 A.M. this morning, Eastern time, right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>The 2020 race is on, Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says that Democrats have a real risk of losing to Donald Trump. The president's response, plus new Fox News polls right here.</p><p>And Bitcoin is soaring once again this morning. Why the cryptocurrency is climbing above $9,000, as you see, all those stories coming up right here and joining me to break it all down in New York, Fox Business Network's Cheryl Casone, along with PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle. Good morning, guys.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Good morning.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Good morning.</p><p>CASONE: Is it as beautiful there as it looks here to us?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it definitely is. Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well, it's partly cloudy here. Just if you wanted a New York city weather report, it's partly cloudy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but the same issues are there and here. We're talking about the same things. Here we have the Federal Reserve meeting this week and I'd like to know, Cheryl, why are we talking about a cut in interest rates when the economy seems to be growing so strongly?</p><p>CASONE: Exactly. Well, look, you know how market participants are. They want nothing but free, easy money and if we could go back to zero, I think Wall Street would be thrilled. But you're right. The economy is doing great. Jobs, unemployment at a -- at a 30-year low. So there's no really strong reason for the rate cut, but I got to say, President Trump would like to see one. So we'll see if that pressure on Jay Powell that he's been putting onto the Fed chair will make ant difference and maybe they'll talk about it at the meeting this week. We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And of course, Mitch, when you have rock bottom rates, it's giving you very few alternatives for your money so that's why we usually see the stock market trade up when you've got such low rates because you're not getting any return in fixed income.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. And one of the reasons why the 10-year treasury and the entire treasury curve has come down is because the rates around the world are so low and we've talked about this a bunch. The fact of the matter is you've got Germany and Japan with negative interest rates on their 10-year treasury. So not only do investors around the world like U.S. treasuries, but they also like U.S. stocks when the treasuries fall.</p><p>So that's why there's a flood of money coming here and I agree our economy's fundamentally strong. I can't wait to hear what the Fed has to say about rates, but there's not a lot of pricing in of rate cut (PH) 24 percent for the June meeting, but 85 percent for the July meeting. So the market is banking on a rate cut this year, this summer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll hear Tuesday and Wednesday, two-day meeting from the Fed. We also have today, there are public hearings for the president's tariffs against China.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we'll talk about that. We got a big three hours here. Former senior advisor to President George W. Bush Karl Rove is joining us this morning, along with the chairman of Laffer Associates, Art Laffer, who was (PH) the former Reagan economic adviser.</p><p>We'll talk with Art about economic trends right now and Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us, along with U.S. Soccer hall-of-famer and Fox Sports analyst Alexi Lalas is with us this morning and two-time Olympic gold medalist, lead match analyst for the FIFA Women's World Cup, Aly Wagner joining us as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big couple of hours right here.</p><p>[07:05:00] We want to kick this hour off with this, the big tech threat, the industry battling for its future against potential new regulations as Congress ramps up regulations on Silicon Valley's largest companies or at least talks about doing so. Facebook fighting to rebuild trust as well. The networking giant now boosting spending on advertising amid a wave of antitrust and privacy probes.</p><p>The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, targeting some of the biggest names in tech over the weekend. In his Stanford commencement speech, Tim Cook says that companies must take responsibility for the chaos that they create. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: This industry is becoming better known for a less noble innovation, the belief that you can claim credit without accepting responsibility. With every data breach, every privacy violation, every blind eye turned to hate speech, fake news poisoning our national conversation, the false miracles in exchange for a single drop of your blood, too many seem to think that good intentions excuse away harmful outcomes. But if you built a chaos factory, you can't dodge responsibility for the chaos. Taking responsibility means having the courage to think things through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the head of global brand strategy for Twitter, Alex Josephson and Alex, it is great to have you on the program.</p><p>ALEX JOSEPHSON, HEAD OF GLOBAL BRAND STRATEGY, TWITTER: Thanks for having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining. So let's take a step back. Your reaction to everything going on within technology today, whether it's the breach of privacy or the calls from Congress that Twitter and others censor conservative speech. What's your reaction?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure. So technology brings the world closer together, it enhances culture, it creates jobs, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It certainly can.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: But any platform that plays a part in that has a responsibility to the users, to the customers who use their service and we take data protection and data privacy at Twitter, for example, we take it very, very seriously. We have really strict regulations in place for any third party that licenses our data. That's both with that technology that we have, teams that we have, reviewing the data licensing in detail manually.</p><p>And the reality is our platform is public. So whenever a user signs up to use the service, everything they're doing on the service, engaging with a tweet, sending a tweet, that's all public information and that's the only information that we license to any sort of third party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you make those decisions, Alex? Because, you know, people are saying, look, you know, why is it that one person gets thrown off the Twitter platform because they didn't -- the speech fit those descriptions ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... and then somebody else isn't? And they'll say, well, maybe because that person's conservative and that person's liberal.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure. So just to be really clear, ideology, subjectivity plays zero role in any decisions we make when we're taking action either on a user or on a tweet or any sort of behavior on the platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And are you watching this?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, as (PH) one of the leaders of the company ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you watch, in fact, what you want to do is actually being executed that way?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Absolutely. So historically, we put too much responsibility, too much onus on the users to report those actions and behaviors to us, but over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, we've implemented machine learning technology that knows what to look for both from an imagery standpoint and a tech standpoint and it proactively detects behaviors that are in violations of our terms and service and of our policies. We've proactively taken action on 40 percent more of those instances this year versus a year ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I've been watching this a lot because I've been hearing a lot on AI.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And even with artificial intelligence, there's an implicit bias, isn't there?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Well, I mean we have a team of humans also watching the algorithms and refining them ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: ... and course correcting them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: So we're proud of the progress we've made over the course of the last year. With that said, health on the platform is our number one priority and we're continuing to invest in that and we're continuing to refine that. And we know we have a lot of work to do ahead of us, but we are proud of the progress we've made.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's funny. You're in charge of brand strategy and yet we are all using Twitter. It's like it's -- the brand is out there.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you've got the president of the United States, the president of India, I mean, using Twitter. This is ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure. Well, all the world leaders are on Twitter. My team specifically at Twitter, we work with the biggest CMOs and the biggest brands and their agency partners around the world, helping them get their brand strategy on Twitter right and a lot of that comes down to understanding our audience, listening to our audience and what really comes into play is when a brand is launching something new or trying to connect with a moment in culture and that's where we really get involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you make such a good point in terms of you working with the other CMOs because what I keep finding from all these chief marketing officers is they're trying to reach young people, they're trying to reach - - this is right in your sweet spot. You've got them.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: It is. We just published research with Interpublic Group, which is one of the major holding companies in the -- in the ad agency space.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: It says that cultural relevance drives 25 percent of all product purchase decisions and ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cultural relevance.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Cultural relevance. So brands who lean into what's happening in the world and have a point of view, those are the brands that are winning the hearts and minds, particularly as you age down amongst consumers, when it comes to Millennials, when it comes to Gen Z.</p><p>[07:10:01] Gen Z users who use Twitter, say they open the app -- daily active users, they open the app multiple times a day, more than 70 percent of Gen Z does that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's amazing. And what really resonates with them is that there's purpose, that there's -- they want like when they want to go work somewhere, they don't necessarily just want to go make a lot of money. They want a company that actually believes in something, has convictions.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: That's right. That's right. Yes. I mean, 70 percent of Gen Zs are buying products from brands because they agree with them on certain social issues. A third of them have already boycotted brands because they disagree with them and brands are leaning into that, particularly when it comes to launching new purpose messaging ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: ... or connecting their company's purpose to something that's happening in culture that's relevant to them. I think a campaign that we all expect to win big in Cannes this year is Nike's Just Do It campaign which all launched with a tweet from Colin Kaepernick's handle. We expect that to make a lot of noise this week in Cannes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder if that's going to be the winner of the award.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: It very -- it very well might.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: It started with a tweet and it ended up driving a $6 billion increase in Nike's market cap in two weeks' time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you like -- you've got to feel great about that. It started with a tweet. You got to explain this new mystery that we're hearing about today from Elon Musk. You know what I'm talking about, right? The Tesla chief says that he has deleted his Twitter account. As it turns out, his Twitter account still exists, but he changed his user name and the new user name is Daddy DotCom.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Well, you know, I can't speak on behalf of Elon Musk. I know his tweets send ripple effects through the platform. I think the infamous tweet about potentially taking Tesla private, that actually drove the stock up by 11 percent in 24 hours. So we talk a lot about starting with Twitter's audience to shape culture and build your brand and I think he's an example of that. I can't describe ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: He really is.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: I can't describe or explain his latest behaviors though (PH) ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Daddy DotCom. OK. You just got off stage, right?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were -- you were just on stage. Tell me about that because you're also marking the launch of a new study that's looking at 2,000 Cannes Lions entries from 2014 to 2018 identifying critical characteristics ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... that define brand campaigns.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes. So Cannes Lions is the -- it's the epicenter of creativity in advertising. It always has been. Half of Grand Prix and gold winners last year integrated Twitter into their -- into their campaigns and so we looked at the Twitter-led campaigns from the last half decade, as you mentioned, and we're really looking at the ones that started on Twitter and then transcended Twitter and either impacted the brand, the business and shaped culture in some unique way, shape or form.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so do you see more CMOs spending money on that?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they investing knowing that these are -- these issues are changing and they ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Absolutely. It's no longer an option to lean into Twitter and start with our audience. It's a necessity. You know, and we're seeing more brands activate on the platform and we're seeing brands that have been active on the platform invest in increasingly amounts year-on-year. We reported our Q1 earnings. Advertising revenue is up 18 percent year-on-year and that's a sign of the times and the sign of marketers knowing where they really have to start when it comes to their biggest audience of the year (PH) ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how do you deepen your relationships? How do you reach more people and get the user base increasing at Twitter ...</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... and how do you deepen that direct to consumer relationship?</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Yes. Absolutely. So we've seen eight consecutive quarters of daily active user growth on Twitter in the range of 9 percent to 14 percent. Q1 was no exception. We reported 11 percent in daily active user growth. All of that's a result of Twitter being what's happening in the world and the product refinements we've made over time to make the app more engaging, to make it more relevant for you. We see direct causation between the product changes we're making and the daily active user growth that we're seeing.</p><p>And of course that's all related to the growth in advertising spend that we're seeing on the platform. More users means more inventory. That means healthier ad engagements. Engagements are up -- ad performance is up on Twitter 23 percent year-on-year, cost is down 4 percent and all of that leads to the fact that the business is up 18 percent year-on-year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that's how you monetize this business. You monetize the platform in that -- it's just advertising. Very simple.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: That's right. It all comes down to our audience. So if you want to reach people who are interested in the NBA finals, or you want to reach K-pop fans -- there were 5 billion tweets about K-pop last year alone -- \"Game of Thrones\" fans, basically any conversation, any audience segment and particularly the ones that are becoming harder and harder to reach because the world is increasingly mobile, consumer fragmentation is at an all time high, that's our sweet spot for marketers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, I will go tweet about it.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: Please. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. Alex, it's good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>JOSEPHSON: It's great -- it's great to be here. Thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alex Josephson. We'll be right back.</p><p>[07:15:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, there is a new fear for border patrol agents. Lauren Simonetti in New York with headlines. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS, REPORTER: Maria, agents are concerned about exposure to illnesses. Union officials say migrants are showing up with the flu, chicken pox, measles. The breakouts being blamed in part on over- crowding in detention facilities and issues with quarantining. And the migrants influx isn't just coming from Latin America. Officials say people fleeing Africa for the U.S. on pace to triple this year.</p><p>Marijuana is not safe for teenage brains. That's the warning from two prominent health professionals, Kenneth Davis, the president of the Mount Sinai Health System, and Mary Kreek, a senior attending physician at Rockefeller University. They penned an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" saying marijuana can impair executive function, processing speed, memory, attention span and concentration. New York state and New Jersey are currently considering legalizing marijuana for those over the age of 21.</p><p>And this, inmates in California are allowed to possess marijuana, but they're not allowed to smoke it. A court rules that a law that legalized recreational possession of marijuana in 2016 did not make an exception for people who are incarcerated. That made laws criminalizing possession in prison obsolete. However, the court did point out, Maria, that smoking or ingesting marijuana is still a felony. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, all right. Thank you so much, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a short break. When we come back, Boeing's startling admission. The CEO is now acknowledging that the company made mistakes that led to those two fatal crashes. Details straight ahead.</p><p>And then Bitcoin back on the upside, the cryptocurrency hitting a one-year high this morning as Facebook says it's ready to unveil its own digital money. All that right after this.</p><p>[07:20:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Boeing's startling admission. CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged that the company did make mistakes in communication, saying that it should have been more transparent with regulators and with the public when it found a safety light malfunction. This as \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that FAA flight trials for the 737 Max safety enhancement could begin this week. The 737 Max has been grounded now for months.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano in New York. And Judge, it's always a pleasure to see you. What does this mean, that the CEO now makes this admission, acknowledges they made mistakes that led to the crashes -- people have died. The lawsuits obviously have probably begun already.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I'm sure the lawsuits have begun. I'm also sure that Dennis Mulholland (PH) ran this statement past his legal department and his PR people before he made it and they came to the conclusion that the evidence is overwhelming. It's apparent what we did. It would be better -- because these cases are going to be resolved by juries. It would be better if we just admitted the obvious and dealt with it.</p><p>Now, I honestly don't know if they're self-insured. They probably have a self-insured retention and then insurance beyond that. They are not protected by the Warsaw or Montreal conventions because they're not a carrier. They're a manufacturer. So they are exposed to potential enormous, enormous liability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. I wonder where this goes. It's incredible because Boeing was doing so well and now you see countries pushing back and stopping orders, changing their order flow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, look, this was catastrophic and there may even be some chicanery involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There may even be some inappropriate interaction -- may be. I don't know this to be so -- interaction with their regulator, with the FAA. You know, you get to a point where the entity being regulated knows more about the technical aspect of what's to be regulated than the government does and you find that the regulation is not what the law requires.</p><p>[07:25:00] I'm not very big on regulations, but you're talking about human safety and human life here and if any corners were cut ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... that's fodder for the Department of Justice to look into.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Speaking of Washington and government, there is a continuing push for impeachment on the Democrats' side. a group of Democrats rallying to impeach President Trump but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she's reluctant, instead encouraging action on issues like healthcare. Listen to what Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn said yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" Judge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARSHA BLACKBURN, UNITED STATES SENATOR: The Democrats are getting mighty antsy about what might be found in that report and about what Attorney General Barr could possibly be looking at because they are the ones who did some outsourcing and working with the Russians and foreign nationals and trying to get information, the dossier paying for that through the Clinton campaign. Everybody is against foreign interference into U.S. policy or elections or influence or any such. It was wrong in 2016. It will be wrong in 2020 and forever more. The Russians have been trying to interfere in U.S. policy for decades.</p><p>So out of all this, I do congratulate my Democrat colleagues for finally admitting that Russia is not our friend. They're a foe. Of course, that is something that former president Obama obviously did not think was a problem because of the comments that he had back when Mitt Romney was his opponent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge, what about that? Do you think that this group of Democrats are going to win and move forward with impeaching, an impeachment trial?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, the lead story in this morning's ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or hearing, rather.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. The lead story in this morning's \"Washington Post\" is that Mrs. Pelosi is still in charge and she's still resisting impeachment. She's either resisting impeachment because she believes it will explode on the Democrats if it's not successful, and it's hard to believe that it would be, or she truly believes there are better things for the government to do.</p><p>I happen to agree with her on this, that impeachment is the wrong thing to do at the present time and the government has a lot of better things to do and the public has a lot more needs to fulfill, but the drum beat continues. Most of the people in favor of impeachment comprise a majority of the House Judiciary Committee. I don't know how much longer she can -- she can keep it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You know, I think if they don't do things for the American people, voters are going to have backlash come 2020. People want to feel like their representatives are actually working for them.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think Mrs. Pelosi understands that ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... but I think there are also members on the hard left side of the Democratic party who believe that their constituents want them to make Donald Trump's life miserable. To me, that's an inappropriate ...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: ... function for the government, making the president's life miserable, but they think this will assure their re-election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Mrs. Pelosi thinks it will assure their defeat and right now, she's still in charge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I think so. They've been resisting from day one. Judge, always a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Enjoy France, my friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Napolitano joining us there. I will. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, 2020 is in focus. Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez makes some predictions. What new Fox News polls are saying as well.</p><p>Then, Mariah Carey mix-up. Check this out. A cake order gone wrong, big- time. The link to the pop star coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live from France at the 2019 Cannes Lions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, happy Monday everybody.

But first, we want to turn to the road to 2020, President Trump doubling down on a warning to Democrats. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I think that we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to Donald Trump if we do not have a presidential candidate that is fighting for true transformational change in the lives of working people in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Sunday shows this weekend and President Trump used her words against her. Tweeting in part, I agree, and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used, writes the president on the heels of Ocasio-Cortez comments.</p><p>The New York Democrat fires back then, she says this. Opening an impeachment inquiry is exactly what we must do when the president obstructs justice, advises witnesses to ignore legal subpoenas and more, writes AOC.</p><p>Joining me right now is Democratic strategist, Bustle Digital group head of research and Fox News contributor, Jessica Tarlov. Jessica, great to see you.</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. Thank you for having me. I'm at your set.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Although here again.</p><p>TARLOV: I know. We had to go far to talk about 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. So what do you think is going on here? The president responding to AOC. She responds back. What's your reaction?</p><p>TARLOV: They've done that a few times before. AOC definitely likes to get into it with leading Republicans. She is making an argument that a number of Democrats have been making lately. But most of the ones who are doing it are from very safe districts. If you look at the bulk of where the party is, they're not in the impeachment camp, they're saying run on the issues, I heard you talking earlier with Andrew Napolitano about that as well. Saying get the job done, run on healthcare, talk about the economy, what we're going to do about criminal justice reform, gun safety measures, get him out of office and move on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it seems like that would be the easiest thing and the right thing to do, given the fact that a lot of the metrics that you would use for a president's performance are very strong.</p><p>Let me bring Mitch and Cheryl in in New York right now. Because we keep talking about a great economy, decisions that many people are happy with and yet there's still this group of Democrats, Cheryl and Mitch, that want to impeach this president.</p><p>CASONE: They want to impeach him. They want Medicare for All. And then they're not paying attention to the role economic fundamentals that were seeing which are so positive, Maria. And you have to wonder if Democrats and these polls are saying they want somebody that's electable. Well, then you got to run on electable issue and it's not going after the big banks which they can't stop doing, you know, in appearance after appearance.</p><p>TARLOV: I'm not sure about this. You were just showing a graphic that shows a slight uptick in the interest in impeachment. And that's when the Fox News poll where there was another metric in there that showing -- show that economic comfort with the economy or economic outlook had actually gone down a bit from a couple months ago.</p><p>So I think that not every metric is going in the president's favor, obviously, in that arena but I still would say run on the issues. You can talk about impeachment, you can talk about obstruction of justice but that's not what motivates people to come out to the polls.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you decided who you're going to get behind on the Democratic field yet, Jessica?</p><p>TARLOV: I have three people but I am really -- would be thrilled with. And it's an exciting, huge field in. Debates are going to be wonderful.</p><p>But Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are top of the list for me now. So you have a moderate and kind of more extreme there with Elizabeth Warren but her surge has just been remarkable the past few weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really has been.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mitch, what about that? I mean, Elizabeth Warren, to see her in the number three spot behind Bernie and Joe Biden is pretty incredible, given that she's a progressive but very aggressive.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And I think it will ultimately be a debate about the economy because some of her views which are, I'd call them anti-business are really sort of flying in the face of all of the growth that we've had in the economy that's been going on, you know, for the duration of the president's administration. So I think it's going to be a debate about whether or not business is the culprit or the reason for the growth in the economy.</p><p>TARLOV: I think Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg as well has been making a really effective argument for what they're calling just capitalism or Democratic capitalism. And it's actually quite similar to what President Trump campaigned on in 2016 where he talked about that the game was rigged against lower and middle class Americans. That message is resonating. Republicans need to be weary of it.</p><p>There was (INAUDIBLE) from the latest Quinnipiac poll that showed that there -- while people vote for the president was hand -- that the economy was doing well, they didn't give the president credit necessarily for that. So connecting those to dots is really going to be key for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. So you've got AOC again going after -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going after Amazon, the Democrat bashing billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos. She said that Bezos is paying workers, quote, starvation wages. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: Do you think that's why he's a billionaire, because he pays his workers starvation wages and --</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think it's certainly part of the equation when you have a very large workforce and you underpay every single person. And then you also participate in -- you know, in taking billions of dollars of government subsidies. I think that could be part of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazon is responding, by the way, and Amazon says, quote, these allegations are absurd. Amazon associates receive industry-leading pay starting at $15.00 an hour. Jessica, what do you make of it?</p><p>TARLOV: It didn't really work for her when she got Amazon booted out of the development in Long Island City.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That didn't work well at all.</p><p>TARLOV: No, that didn't play well with her fellow representatives, state representatives and mostly -- most importantly the constituents. This is a line of argumentation that a lot of Democrats are making.</p><p>I saw Amazon go after Joe Biden as well who's probably the most moderate of the bunch in here when he said they paid zero in corporate taxes. That's a good tact for AOC to be going with.</p><p>I think for Joe Biden long term, he's probably going to have to moderate on that, I think with the way that Amazon is certainly in everyone's lives. There's a very positive view of the company and if they can come up with data and say we're even paying, you know, $17.00 an hour in Arkansas, then they don't look so bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, it was pretty much a black mark when she, you know, stopped Amazon from coming to New York, right, Mitch? I mean, why does she keep talking about Amazon?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It's fascinating and let's not forget the jobs that were lost in New York were not $15.00 an hour jobs. They were six figure jobs that would have helped the local economy on Long Island City would have helped all of New York. So, there's a big disconnect between her view of them paying starvation wages and what they would have been paying people if they were in New York.</p><p>TARLOV: It's actually one of the strongest arguments people are making that she should have a primary challenger from the center, so do to her what she did to Joe Crowley just a couple years ago. I would imagine that she would get reelected. But it is an interesting conversation to be having since the justice Democrats, the far lefties love to get into races and kind of pick on moderates who are doing things to actually cater to their constituents.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point because a lot of people say that right now she's trying to come up with challengers for Jerry Nadler and others. She wants her progressive candidates right in there. She wants to unseat all these moderates and Nadler's hardly a moderate, by the way.</p><p>TARLOV: No, going after Jerry Nadler is not smart. I mean, this is someone who's obviously the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, beloved in the party, he was my congressman all going through upset next to my mom in law school. So big fan of Jerry Nadler's. That's not a smart attack.</p><p>But she went after Dianne Feinstein. They pick on moderates or moderates all over the country. It brews and sews more discord than we need especially looking at 2020. Because it will be hard to unseat a sitting president. Just statically speaking, that doesn't happen that often.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is this just one bridge too far? I mean, Cheryl, when I look at our audience, when I look at my friends, your friends, I feel like everyone's pretty much hanging out in the middle. I mean, you might lean to rot one, you know, to the right on some things you might lean to the left on other things but the majority of the country is hanging out in the middle. And so, I don't understand why we give so much attention to the extremists like an AOC when in fact that's not where the country is. Does she not see that?</p><p>CASONE: Well, she obviously is not looking at the most recent polling that we've seen Maria, which shows that within likely Democratic voters, the number one thing they want, electability. And that at this point, if you look at the polls is Joe Biden, it is not Bernie Sanders. It's definitely not AOC's ideas which is kind of half of Bernie Sanders' platform right now.</p><p>So, at this point -- you know, electability and they're still talking about healthcare, those are the two things they should focus on. The impeachment thing needs to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'll tell you, Joe Biden is keeping a low profile isn't he?</p><p>TARLOV: He had a really bad week last week. I think he'll be out more, there's a big event in South Carolina over the weekend where he will definitely be attending. But he's doing well at the Fox News poll was really good for him as Cheryl said on the electability question. I think he's running a really good campaign. We should also pay attention to the fact that AOC hasn't endorsed yet. She was a Bernie girl in 2016. A lot of people think she's eyeing Elizabeth Warren potentially as her progressive candidate versus Bernie.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, I would have thought President Obama would be -- you know, supporting Joe Biden but not happening.</p><p>TARLOV: No, he and Michele said months and months ago, there are too many people in the race, when you have 23 candidates. And they have -- you know, very good relationship with at least 10 of them. It would be unfair to do that, even if there are friendship bracelets in the mix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jessica, good to see you.</p><p>TARLOV: It was great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jessica, thank you.</p><p>TARLOV: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jessica Tarlov here in Cannes with me. We will take a short break. When we come back, Bitcoin is taking off this morning, the cryptocurrency topping $9,000 on reports Facebook maybe launching its own digital money.</p><p>Then, Maria mix-up, one person's a pop star, another pioneer scientist mixed up at the bakery. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A merger in the drug industry to report. Lauren Simonetti with headlines right now in New York, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria. Another oncology takeover, the Biotech Company set to acquire Array Biopharma for a deal worth about $11.4 billion. The transaction will be done using stock valued at $48.00 a share. Array's portfolio includes cancer fighting drugs and you can see share reaction, Array shares surging 60 percent this morning.</p><p>Well, Bitcoin surging again. It climbed above $9,300 over the weekend after Facebook announced plans for its own cryptocurrency. Investors say the number of companies signing up for Facebook system is restoring confidence in digital money.</p><p>Mariah, Marie, the names causing a bit of a mix-up at a bakery in England. A woman named Siobhan asked a coworker for a birthday cake with Mariah Carey's face on it. Well, they tried. The cake reportedly arriving with a picture of the Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie. She won the prize in 1903 for her work in radiation. The cake shown off in a tweet by Siobhan's cousin has racked up more than 200,000 likes. A notable woman nonetheless, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And very different looking than Mariah Carey.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You think?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was funny.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sparking some scientific tweets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Lauren. Coming up, Gary Woodland winning the U.S. Open, what led to his surprise victory, we've got sports coming up right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. From Sunny Cannes, France, here, we are looking at sports this morning. Brooks Koepka quest for U.S. Open history in sunny California. Jared Max joins us now with more, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Brooks Koepka earned a check for $1.35 million yesterday for second place. The winner's check for $2.25 million went to 35-year-old Gary Woodland from Topeka, Kansas. First time on tour. He did not peak too soon. Offers have a lifetime when leading after 54 holes, Woodland held off Koepka by three shots. His first major win. Koepka the first ever to shoot all four rounds in the 60s at the U.S. Open and not win. Tiger Woods tied for 21st, 11 shots back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY WOODLAND, GOLFER: It means everything especially, you know, being in America, we have men and women that go out and fight and serve and sacrifice for us to go out and here and play a game. I was able to come play a game at Pebble Beach and walk away U.S. Open champion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Proud American. It was a record setting Sunday for U.S. Women's National Soccer star Carli Lloyd, 36 years old, she became the oldest player to score twice in a Women's World Cup match. And after Carli's first goal, well, she took a funny shot at those critics who said team USA celebrated too much in winning 13-0. This time a sarcastic golf clap from Carli Lloyd. The next match will be Thursday against Sweden.</p><p>And 30 minutes from now, Maria's going to talk to former U.S. soccer stars and Fox Sports analyst Aly Wagner and Alexi Lalas. This coming up at 8:20 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Did you see how much money somebody paid for a jersey worn by Babe Ruth circa 1928 to 1930? This jersey worn by the Babe at the time he earned $70-80,000 in annual salary purchased at auction for $5.64 million. Via that's more than $1.2 million more than the previous record for sports memorabilia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVE HUNT, PRESIDENT, HOT AUCTIONS: There's only about six of these known of any equality. This is from that late 20s, that murder Israel era. And you see just the beautiful condition, original Yankees across front which is interestingly the only time in their history that that franchise name was across their jersey,</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: And look at that, the estimate was $4.5 million when David Hunt from Hunt's auction spoke with MORNINGS WITH MARIA. $5.64 million, a lot of money Maria for a piece of laundry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. And we -- and we were -- we were awe -- in awe of it when he came and he brought the jersey on-set and now we see, wow, we underestimated the value.</p><p>MAX: I wonder is that the same one George Costanza wore to work when he put on the U.S. trying to get himself fired. Maybe a little jam on it herself then don't wear it to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. That's funny. Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Radio, Sirius Radio XM 115.</p><p>We'll slip in a short break, and then the Trump economy. Former Reagan economic advisor Art Laffer is here on trade tensions with China and what new Fox News polls are saying now about the perception of the economy, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO.)</p><p> LAWYER HARMEET DHILLON</p><p>LIVE ACTION FOUNDER LILA ROSE </p><p>[*]TRUMP: Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down. I want to thank you all for being here. Very special day, very important day. Many of you are friends and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like but I know what you sound like-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--which I guess is probably more important, right? But I want to thank you and it's a terrific--it's a terrific day to be together and if you look you are in a very famous place. We all work very hard and I don't know if you call it influence, I don't if you call it power but whatever it is we are in the White House and we are going to stay in the White House and we are going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(INAUDIBLE). So I am thrilled to welcome you here and we are all working very hard and I don't if you know but we just hit 27,000 on the Dow, that's the highest in history. We are up a couple of hundred points today. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>The highest in history for those of you that like the stock market. The stock market means jobs; I view it as jobs and I view it as 401(k)s. When the people say oh, the rich people are getting rich but if you look at the numbers the greatest impact proportionately is blue-collar workers in what is happened in this miracle that is happening. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they are up 72 percent and 67 percent and the wife or the husband whoever is responsible the other one says you're a genius, you're a great financial investor. Darling you're up 77 percent this year. So a lot of good things happen. A lot of people are happy and I think really everybody is happy, some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalist and influencers and that is exactly what you are, you are journalists and you are influencers come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.  </p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You are challenging the media gatekeepers in the corporate sensors to bring the facts straight to the American people and that is what you are doing. You were going right to the people possibly we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody what do you think I would do without social media? Would I be here because I said I think so but they weren't so sure. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I have to say that you know that. I'm not sure I believe that but I have to say it. </p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake news filter, very simple. Together you reach more people than any television, broadcast network by far, not even close. We are delighted to be joined at the summit by someone you know very well, our senior advisor for digital strategy and somebody that has been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Stand up. So long before we were even doing this he was at a club, running a club and other businesses and he was okay at doing it, not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest but you know what he was great at, he was always looking at his computer screen. I said that guy's incredible so right at the beginning I said that the man and there's nobody better at that and I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Right? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I had my Dan and he works at about 28 hours a day and he works very hard. He doesn't work. I mean he loves it. He loves it. And his imagination and really working with all of you and many of you will come up with ideas and you will come up with ideas and he will run into my office and so you got to see this. And a lot of times I will go out I will spend a lot of money on a concept. I will say here's a concept come up with this and we will hire these companies and they want a lot of money and they come back, just happened the other day, right? I said that's terrible; these guys have no talent. The people that have a talent are the people that we deal with and it's true and some of you are extraordinary. Can't say everybody. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Unbelievable. So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Where Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur. We have a meeting in a little while on the census and citizenship. Can you believe are you a citizen of the United States of America. Sir, you can't ask that question.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Why? Because the court said you can't. We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all of the way; the judges don't like us too much I guess. But think of that. Herman(SP), think of that question. Are you a citizen? We spend--this is another thing that so crazy $20 billion on a census, $20 billion, they spent $20 billion. I  said 20 billion what? $20 billion on a census. </p><p>They go through houses. They go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks, how many beds, what is their roof made of? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>The only thing we can't ask is are you a citizen of the United States. Is that the craziest thing? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>$20 billion. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie(SP).  </p><p>Also David Bernhardt, great job you are doing, interiors. He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are--I just bought another building. Big deal Kevin(SP), right? They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt he controls half of the United States; Department of Interiors, a lot of land, a lot of beautiful and that we are taking good care of, David, right?  </p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We are working on our budget along with some of the great members of Congress and wonderful friend of mine who's my leader, right? He's my leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that Marshall(SP) but Kevin, stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy everybody. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee; we campaigned together. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And she (INAUDIBLE), we can say it now, she ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years, he really was good man, right? And Governor for quite a long time, eight years and she just didn't stop.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TRUMP: She was down by 10 and she won by 12. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That's right. She was down by 10 and she won by 12 and she wouldn't stop. Every day, where is she? She's here, she's there. Fantastic job you did we are proud of you. Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just honestly working with people that know what they are doing it's fun. That was fun and you know what you are doing.  </p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw who was very good at this by the way, Dan, very good at this, really good. Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It's great to have you in the party and you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay. That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.  </p><p>A friend of mine and a wonderful person and somebody that has I don't know pretty unlimited future I would say. I hear a lot of very positive things, Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And you know I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is, Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said what do you think Liz and you said absolutely he deserves it and it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So thank you for that, for that help.  </p><p>Matt Gaetz, where is Matt? Stand up, Matt.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Boy, a great defender he gets on television and he's like it doesn't stop and he's smart and he's good and he loves Florida and he loves his people and he's a hard worker. And Matt thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much. And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. Great job, Mike. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said a long time ago when we said let's do it because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that I said Josh you got to run. Well, I don't know. You know he had a good set up pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere; he could do whatever he wanted in his great state unless I'm telling you can do it and she turned out-- she's a tough candidate whether you like her or you don't like her -- she's tough, right? And by the end of that that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won and he's young and he's brilliant and I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words if you don't mind about what we are doing and come on up right now I think it would be a good time. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>HAWLEY: Thank you. Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>You know, the media--the media says, the establishment media, the fake media, they say, \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else, and we can't let them.  </p><p>And that's why we need to step up now and I think we need to say to them here's the deal, Google, Facebook, Twitter, they've gotten the special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They are treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain, they have to quit discriminating against conservatives. You agree with that? No more. No more discrimination. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It's that simple. That's all we're asking for. They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms who've gotten rich off of our information, right, off of our data, off of everything we've given them, they got rich off of it, they got rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate, they shouldn't censor, they shouldn't shut us down. To make the President to give her his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP: And you know, Josh is doing right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what is happening. I never hear about the other side. I could tell you I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but technologically I would think I'm okay, just okay. But I will tell you a lot about things are happening. I people come up to me, \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\"  </p><p>And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people and I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because you know you also cool off, right? But much hotter-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Especially with the nice new stock market like it is, right? But no, I'm hotter now and I go to Dan,  I say, \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people. I'm not complaining. We're like at 60 some odd million, but then we have 5 different sites and we have another site with 25 million we have another site with 10 or 12, then we have Facebook, then we have Instagram. We have a lot. We have a lot of people, way, way over 100 million, but I use to pick them up and I--when I say used to, I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long. And I noticed things happening when I put out something, a good one that people like </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Right? A good tweet, it goes up. It use to go up, it would say 7000, 7008-7000, 7017, 7024, 7032, 70444, right?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Now it goes 7000, 7008, 6998. Then they go 7009, 6074. I say, \"What is going on? It never did that before.\" It goes up and then they take it down, then it goes up. I had never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this? I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocketship when I put out a beauty. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Like when I said--remember I said somebody was spying on me? That thing was like a rocket I get a call two--two minutes later, \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>\"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>We turn out to be right about a lot of things. But--but I never had it. I'm just saying from, you know, from the standpoint of--of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became president. I'm sure I could've done it, as we said, much--I would have--there's no question I would've done it either way. I said to Mark Burnett the other day, so I said, \"So the Apprentice. Had I never done the Apprentice,\" because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons, I said, \"Had I never done the Apprentice, would I be president?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show. But with social media--so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up, down. Up, down. Now ultimately, you get--but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are--they're taking it up as it goes up. And it--and it--sometimes it comes down substantially.  </p><p>A number of months ago I was at a certain number. You know, many millions, and then all of the sudden, I was down over a million, and then I came down. I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said, \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\" And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because first of all, if I did it, it's a front-page story all over the place. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But I know a lot of people, there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. I say there's no way because nobody has any interest in these people. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>There's--they have no--now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games. James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy and he's a straight shooter. He's tough. But then when they want to take him off and other people like him, many in this room, some in this room, it's a very, very bad--it's a very bad thing.  </p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts, and together, everyone in this room, we reach over half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number because one of the things I get that's a little benefit, I'll go watch like I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the--the real credit over and--and--you know, it's Golan Heights and Israel. Very important. But I gave representation in the strongest form of the Golan Heights, Israel.  </p><p>I talked about it a little quickly. They've been looking at it for 52 years they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing. They fly in, they fly out.\" Some had beautiful planes, some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane, but they have many summits.  </p><p>I said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it, and within two seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over it. He said, \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" It doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up. Now, that's Twitter. That social media. I call Twitter a typewriter. That's what I really call Twitter because it goes on to Facebook automatically and it goes on to Instagram and it goes on to television, more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>\"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>\"He doesn't know how to spell 'the.' He spelled it T-H-I.\" You know, I couldn't care--any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I--really--I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said the fingers aren't as good as the brain. But--but it is true and it's--it's incredible what it does. I put a social media statement.  </p><p>And I was telling Kellyanne the other what day, I said, \"You know, I used to put out like a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of.\" You know, next day, two days, they'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out--we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out on social media a statement like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated but a very important statement--now they're going crazy. \"What is it? Tell me what.\" Watch. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But it's very important. But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me--same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC, they're stone cold crazy. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I made them a lot of money with the Apprentice and I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC, but they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. The used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead. Big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I was there 12--12 years, 14 seasons, and then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>You know, I own that with--with Mark Burnett and some people and I said--they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success, you own it, so you benefit financially, or would you rather have him die so that you say you did it for 14 seasons, 12 years?\" I said, \"I think I'd rather have him die at it.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>TRUMP: That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have them (INAUDIBLE). Anyway, but with amazing creativity and determination we are bypassing the corrupt establishment and it is corrupt, and you are bypassing the very, very corrupt media, which not all of it is but much of it is far greater percentage than anyone would understand as the cameras go off they go the red lights look. Boom. I can always tell.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I can always tell. Be in the stadium the red lights are all on and then we start talking about like the media how dishonest it is how corrupt it is, how fake it is and the lights go off. The lights immediately go off and usually immediately come back they say this guy is impossible. But I want to just say because you people have a lot of courage each and every one of you I say thank you very much on behalf of a nation thank you very much. It's important what you're doing. In many cases, the honest the hones word out. Not in all cases but in many cases. When historians look back at this time they will see that the biggest new stories of this era are totally ignored. I--I can tell you that I deal with the media and the spin they put on it or the--sometimes they leave it out or there is something slightly negative they will make it headline news. They will put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by media they were broken up by citizens or take a look at what is happening or you see stories that should be phenomenal, big beautiful, stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And with Secretary Azar it was a big, big important thing. Got very little coverage. And what we did it was such a great thing and I don't care we don't have to get the--it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides we have made in what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered.  </p><p>And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't' want to let that happen. Now if somebody else were in this position such as the previous administration they would make that headline news all over the place what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it we get very little credit to that. But anything bad that happens I always say they can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad and they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad. It's incredible what they can do. I always say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Benuchi(PH) knows. He said, man, you get the greatest press until I got deleted. Then it's done. But I used to get the greatest press. Possibly one of the reasons I'm here. And we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we would have to try. I didn't think it would be this tough and by the way two of those special people I have to say hello to--to because my wife said I see these two beautiful women, incredible African American women that are on television. The are unbelievable. This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I am talking about.  </p><p>She was, our first lady said you have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius and they like you. I said, I want to see them. And I like them. I love them actually, I love them. Come.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, when the historians look back they are going to see something very important took place right here-before today it took place--it started taking place a number of years ago and it is something that nobody ever thought would happen. Free speech is a bed rock of American life our Constitutional rights must be forcibly protected and I want you to know that we will always have your back. We are fighting for you very hard. We are going to be calling a big meeting of your companies for in a week or two that have to be here. And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness that's happening.  </p><p>And, remember we won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls like yesterday they were telling me. I said can you imagine if I actually got good press instead of even fair press, I don't want good I want fair. Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories--you know the Russian hoax, I call it the Russian hoax, the witch hunt. All bad publicity and yet we are doing great in the polls. So people understand that the public is very smart but we are getting the word out about so many things not just that. About so many things. And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs now more people working today than ever in the history of our country.  </p><p>Everyone in the history of our country. Think of that. Unemployment the best numbers in 51 years for African American the best numbers in our history--in our history.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Right? Including you. And you're making a lot I hope. But Hispanic American, best numbers in history.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Stand up. And I like your dress as well very much. No. Not you, sir. You. Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job. But Hispanic American the best in history. Asian American the best in history. Women I think (INAUDIBLE), the best in 75 years. The best--best unemployment in 75 years. What we're doing it's nothing like has this has been done. Our military is now stronger when I took it over it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they couldn't fly. They had to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion then $716 billion and we are going to be asking for another one this year and it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good that's jobs you know, in this case jobs aren't important compared to military defense. We make the best planes and rockets and military defense in the world. Nothing like it. And we are doing something that is incredible. Our military is strong. Our--our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this. Whoops. How did a flag get into the White House. I don't like flies. I don't like flies.  </p><p>So, I just want to tell you just in finishing up we had a terrible bias. We had censorship like nobody had any understanding and nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone, right? That's right. Thank you. There he is. Thank you. Stand up, please. Stand up.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>How good--what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. He's not controversial. He's truthful. He's truthful. That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.  </p><p>So, you know, they're playing with--with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that in theory--in theory they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side--they should be really liking our side because we're the ones that want freedom you see what's happening up on the debate stand you see what they are doing to each other. You see the hate they have up there. It is a very different philosophy. It is a very different thought. And I say this the election that is coming up is I think and you know, we talked 2016 and I would say maybe that's the most important and certainly I said it but what we are really fighting for there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again because what they are looking at is pure socialism. Or worst than socialism. You know, there's a work called communism too. There's a word called--they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called communism and they're trying to get socialism over the line. But these people are--this is beyond socialism to a larger extent and I think we are going to have a tremendous success.  </p><p>We had a sort of an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 maybe more I think it was one and two come we were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We had a 21,000 seat stadium and then with the basketball court it held way more than that. It was packed. We had a similar number outside. And we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there and this was an opening and this was like a Biden they said he had 600--that wasn't 600 that was 150 people.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That was 150 that was a very small crowd. And even the big crowds if they have 100 that's a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They won't even say that. They never will say that. We had on the mall just the other day the fourth of July a tremendous success it was pouring. The weather was just--it was beautiful in one way. Orlando was my (INAUDIBLE) that day.  </p><p>TRUMP: Because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. Iran and they learn it's my hair because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Let's go over here, let's go this one, that one, this desert, let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane sir the wind is blowing about 70 miles an hour. I said boy, it's got to be mine(SP) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all and I will tell you what more than anything else I have met great people. I have met great people, dedicated people and I think that the election coming up, Kevin(SP) this is the most important election of our times. This is an election were our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela and that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. This green new deal and you know I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early.  </p><p>I spoke too early on Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. I should have saved it but you know I don't like to go to early because I don't want it to change. I like the green new deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make--you know the problem with this business they can make a change and eat immediately upon making the it last for about a week you look at for instance on the wall Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall, right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody, Hillary, everybody. They were all in favor of a wall just a few years ago. Now a wall is--well, that's okay. They want open borders, they want people to pour in including criminals and worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good politically. Nobody can tell me.  </p><p>So all Americans regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them, that includes them but they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shot out. I wrote a few terms, I said to my son Don who's here somewhere. Where are you, Don? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>He's very good, Kimberly(SP). Don. People like Don. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Good. Thank you, Don. But road out a few--shadow ban 100 percent you look at what's going on. You know I could go with a block in just a place sick blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join, they don't, there's no doubt in my mind then I should have millions and millions--I have millions of people, so many people I wouldn't believe it that I know we have been blocked. People come up to me and they say sir, I--I can't follow you. They make it impossible.  </p><p>These are people that are really good at what they do. They say they make it absolutely impossible and you know we can't have it. We are not going to let it happen. Josh(SP) we are not going to let it happen and you know if they did it on both sides and if it were done to the other side, to the other group and I am representing everybody, I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal, I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along, we want to make sure everybody loves each other if that is possible and maybe I really believe it is. Someday it will be. I--guy for a file have said that the thing that is going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success, greater than we have ever had before. I mean our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and where is China has gone down trillions of dollars, the tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them but I want them to give us a fair playing field but China has gone down trillions, we have gone up not billions, trillions.  </p><p>We have gone up in value and worth. I want everybody to do well but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat--everybody has to be treated fairly their side, our side. We all have to be treated fairly and you know the farmer say we just want a level playing field, sir. I love the farmers. They are patriots and China as you know targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of and had no effect.  </p><p>I would watch even on networks that don't exactly like me and I would watch as they interview farmers and they wouldn't have 10 or 12 people sitting around they would say we don't care, the President is right, we have been ripped off for many years, somebody has to do--somebody had to do this. China made over the last 10 years hundreds of billions of dollars, you could say $400 billion, $500 billion a year. That is not sustainable, that is not--we built China and you know what they have done a great job, I don't blame them. I blame our former presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the world trade organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billion dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China.  </p><p>So those days are over. So right now they are paying 25 percent on $250 billion, a lot of money coming in. You know we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. I would say I wonder how that happened because the first quarter is the weakest quarter (INAUDIBLE) almost our weakest and we had this great quarter but I don't consider 3.2 great, I consider much higher and frankly if we had lower interest rates we are forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that is high, we have somebody that likes raising rates. I think he is maybe going to change but we will find out but if we had lower we would have another 10,000 points. We just sent a record. You know I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record 27,000. I said we could do 10,000 points higher. We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation.  </p><p>The big thing is inflation, there is no inflation but we are doing so well we are going to keep it that way so I just want to introduce because a person that I have admired for a long time, he's a great lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country and Harmeet could you come up just say a few words please? Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>DHILLON: Thank you Mr. President It is a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire. </p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and they banning that we are experiencing is all in our heads, they are gas sliding us with this line. </p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my loft practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American who is a supporter of yours, has been for many decades. Well, twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day, took him off, said he was band and then he complained and they let him back on and then the next name they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident. James Demoore (PH) is another great American who are represent. Mr. Demoore (PH) complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and push for more ballots. Natalie was he fired for daring to do that but then the social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weapon eyes their platforms and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That is a disgrace but it goes beyond that.  </p><p>The social media CEOs come to Congress in front of the (INAUDIBLE) members of Congress here and they have lied about what they do. They have lied about the data theft, they have lied about the media manipulation and they can't get away with that. Now Sen. Blackburn knows from what happened to her on twitter that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I am very concerned that the effect of the outcome of the 2018 election and if we let them do what they have been doing it is going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well. So Mr. President thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues and we are all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every Americans voices heard. Thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP: And what (INAUDIBLE) said is so--so true. It is really incredible. You know I have watched some of these things that have been taped and gotten through talented people by the way but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of our party, of our people, of our voice and you say that's the collusion, bats the collision between the Democrats and the media and social media and these platforms. It's--it's a disgraceful thing and another thing I believe you are representing a young man who just got slogged viciously slogged I think it is a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after bikers for Trump. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Did you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers who love us. They don't go after the police, they don't go after. You know we are the Ely. They say you ever I did better than all of them. Great education, the greatest but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. Their arms are this big. Look, like this. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But they have the black--they have the masks on and they have sticks and they hit people. They had people in the face, in the head. This is (INAUDIBLE) but did you ever notice antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally?' </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>TRUMP: They are never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the president. There are never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school. And as you probably know, I think all of you know, we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We are taking money away from those schools. We're going to-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars and they don't allow free speech. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Now, we don't want anything special, but we want free speech. We were also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much. And president of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration, Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much. </p><p>ROSE: I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity. We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that in order to reinstate our accounts, we have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.  </p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content with no evidence. And then news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.  </p><p>And then recently, our videos have been viewed more--more highly than almost any other abortion related content on YouTube, but YouTube--we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So there's a double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that. So thank you so much-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Thank you-- </p><p>ROSE: --To the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: Great job. Thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>TRUMP: So one of the advantages of being president is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know, I can think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say I'd like to see you in the Oval Office, or you have somebody call Oval Office. I've been with all of these people at the highest-level one-on-one, just recently with Google and just recently with Twitter, the top, right? And you talk to them and you swear there like your best friend. \"Oh, sir, no, we are--we believe we--freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absolutely.\" And we go out--he says liar. Who said that? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>You must come from Queens. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>So--so it's very interesting to see that and--and the level of, you know, you look at them, the sincerity, and I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave and then I'll realize three or four weeks later, it's worse. It's actually got worse. Because I say look, I believe in technology, I believe in free markets, I believe in freedom of speech, I believe in all the things, and--and they are super genius. I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China and they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart in that sense, may be not smart and other senses, I've watched some of them speak before Congress, it's not pretty. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I said I could do much better than that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But I'll tell you what, technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you know who at Twitter, number one-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>We talked about certain things. He said, \"Yeah, we could do this, this, this.\" I said \"That's really great. You know, this is incredible stuff.\" China will admit there's nobody like these brains, but they are not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly and they have to do that. And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.  </p><p>So to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's a very dangerous speech, and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Some it came to my office, I won't say who, but a very big person and I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term fake news,\" which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure if I said that I get credit, they'd say, \"13 years ago someone to come up with that term fake--\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I think I get credit. I'd be very proud to take it, but I think I get credit. Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using fake news. I saw the other day on CNN, total fakes, I see on CNN they go, \"Fake news media has reported.\" No, no, no, they are fake news media. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>They've turned it around. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>They turned it around. So I'm not going to allow, and Josh and all of us, we're just not going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced. Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off and we fought on all of you and many of you are back now. But many of the names I won't mention your names, some--some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason. I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I mean, some of you guys are out there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But even you should have a voice. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>But some of you--no, some of you deserve--some of you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But they take off people that, you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject. Based on the feedback that we are hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting at a real conversation. We might want to invite some of you. I know Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.  </p><p>And it's amazing how the senators, including Democrats, in all fairness, which is probably--because I know it can turn on them also, it could turn very quickly. But they want to come, so we'll let you know the date, okay? And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room, and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.  </p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not--I am not speaking for our side assuming we're all--I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody.  </p><p>Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people. To all of the social media influencers here today, a lot of--you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. As you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to. I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people in so many cases. I look around the room. I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life of the last short period of time with his new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.  </p><p>So thank you all for being here, it's a great honor, a tremendous honor. We're going to take a few questions, I think, and then I'll head out and you're going to actually come, if you want. You can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we are not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form, and I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people. Really good. Okay, any questions? Please. Oh, there he is. There's my guy. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President </p><p>TRUMP: Good job. How is your new show going? Good? </p><p>QUESTION: Very well, thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: I heard good. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Yes, indeed. America First, Salem Radio Network, Sebastian Gawker (PH). We have half a billion people that we can access with you as well, and we thank you for the role that you played-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Thank you-- </p><p>QUESTION: --In making sure that they try and stop throttling us-- </p><p>TRUMP: --That's okay. Don't worry. Fake news. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>There trying to--they are trying to divert your attention. </p><p>QUESTION: What--what message would you-- </p><p>TRUMP: --They're playing with your mind, Sebastian. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>That doesn't work too well with you. Let's go. </p><p>QUESTION: It doesn't work with people in this room. What message would you have us send to our followers about what's being done to them and the importance of this issue for 2020? Because a lot of people out there who call into my show don't want to use their real name, are afraid of putting their--their views up on the internet.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-DPY1-F15W-H0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever. </p><p>I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office. </p><p>We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual. </p><p>TRUMP: Keep you busy, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>We're keeping you busy, Ken. </p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas. </p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound. </p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them -- what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way. </p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs. </p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with -- I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And it all seems to be working out pretty well. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much. </p><p>TRUMP: You're doing a great job. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: And thank you for it. </p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one -- the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person. </p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world. </p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a \"government.\" It might be a public-private. It may be something -- a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right? </p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year. </p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it. </p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars. </p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there -- every one of them. </p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \"You're fired.\" \"You're fired.\" It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position -- must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position. </p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky -- he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman? </p><p>BURCHETT: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: He wouldn't do that. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, \"That's okay.\" And here we are doing what we're doing today. </p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving -- much lower salary -- I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number. </p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please? </p><p>LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President. </p><p>We were founded -- we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the -- and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans. </p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans. </p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs. </p><p>TRUMP: Good. </p><p>LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: So you're the one that took the ad about me that -- I didn't know that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>I was just saying, you know, \"I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\" Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, \"What's that?\" But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \"This guy is actually making $8 million a year.\" And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a -- a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay? </p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that -- I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that. </p><p>LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>But if I could -- </p><p>TRUMP: I accept -- I accept your apology. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, \"Who's your audience?\" And I said, \"Just one person. He's the only one that...\" -- </p><p>TRUMP: That's smart. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>LYNN: -- \"...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.\" </p><p>BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it -- who has guts to do it. </p><p>TRUMP: I'll tell you, though -- I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the -- </p><p>LYNN: 1933, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been -- you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot. </p><p>But for a essentially -- I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million -- now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \"You know, I think you ought to get more money.\" And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \"I wonder why.\" </p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately. </p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin. </p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you? </p><p>WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper. </p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that. </p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done. </p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come. </p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these -- our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain. </p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake. </p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty. </p><p>TRUMP: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call -- Mark just brought this in from -- the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. </p><p>(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.) </p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note. </p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right? </p><p>HENSON: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Your group. That's great, isn't it. </p><p>HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers -- I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message -- a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \"I'm working on that.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: And you did a good job. </p><p>HENSON: So I appreciate you. </p><p>TRUMP: Everybody in this room did a good job. </p><p>HENSON: I appreciate you, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job. </p><p>BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you. </p><p>TRUMP: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you, brother. </p><p>TRUMP: That's only phase one. Phase two is -- imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right? </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is. </p><p>TRUMP: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care. </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: But, you know, it shouldn't happen. </p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because -- </p><p>BURCHETT: I'll look into that. </p><p>TRUMP: -- I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily. </p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good. </p><p>Please, go ahead. </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line -- I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley. </p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained -- training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because -- </p><p>TRUMP: You're doing great. </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: You had a big victory already. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. </p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us. </p><p>TRUMP: I appreciate it, and thank you very much. </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you. </p><p>Wendy, please. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (INAUDIBLE) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward -- so, thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: And this was -- everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess-- right? -- if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right? </p><p>TURNER: Right. Yeah. </p><p>TRUMP: That's a terrible thing. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah. </p><p>TRUMP: They're waiting for it to happen to them. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on -- </p><p>TRUMP: You've been training people? </p><p>TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure? </p><p>TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st. </p><p>TRUMP: So you're training people to take your job at a -- whatever. Right? </p><p>TURNER: They told us it would be -- </p><p>TRUMP: And where are the people from that you're training? </p><p>TURNER: All over the place. We -- everything is done remotely or -- </p><p>TRUMP: Are they from other countries? </p><p>TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as -- </p><p>TRUMP: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right? </p><p>HENSON: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- -- Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Let's see that they get their jobs back -- </p><p>TURNER: Thank you very much. </p><p>TRUMP: -- because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers -- that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to -- if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think -- I'll bet you are. </p><p>But I said, \"I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\" Right, Tim? </p><p>BURCHETT: Absolutely. </p><p>TRUMP: That's, to me, very important. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard. </p><p>Chuck, please. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay? </p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay? </p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today. </p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission. </p><p>TRUMP: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area. </p><p>TRUMP: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams -- that produce power from 29 -- to do flood control. </p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case. </p><p>TRUMP: Right. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants -- nuclear power plants. </p><p>TRUMP: What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or -- </p><p>HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama. </p><p>TRUMP: Wilson in Alabama. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>So I defer to the expert about that. </p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very -- a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (INAUDIBLE) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks -- cyberattacks -- testing its network here, right? </p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay? </p><p>TRUMP: Good. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this -- and I just kind of -- you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch -- okay? -- that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours. </p><p>TRUMP: I remember that very well. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related -- or familiar with that. So, as a -- it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances. </p><p>TRUMP: I agree. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: -- dedicated to that job. </p><p>TRUMP: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen. </p><p>TURNER: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a -- quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact -- the Tennessee Valley has always -- our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it. </p><p>And I'd like -- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. And you're going to lose -- you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are -- they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation. </p><p>Go ahead. Let's -- let's go, Chuck. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again -- okay -- reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars -- for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to -- </p><p>TRUMP: Who is the consulting firm? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TRUMP: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a -- </p><p>TRUMP: We just found another nugget of gold. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm. </p><p>HENSON: It's not -- it's not a consulting -- that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that -- just for that one company. </p><p>TRUMP: How many are there -- how many are there like that? </p><p>HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA -- </p><p>TRUMP: And they're paying tremendous amount of money? </p><p>HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable. </p><p>TRUMP: Very -- they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named? </p><p>HENSON: Really? I just know that -- </p><p>TRUMP: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>I don't care who they are, but they -- they are very political. </p><p>HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing -- I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it -- and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched. </p><p>TRUMP: It's a racket. </p><p>HENSON: They've been touched. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>No, it's a racket. </p><p>I mean -- I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much -- much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm. </p><p>HENSON: Well, they're -- they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That -- </p><p>TRUMP: That's worse. </p><p>HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean -- </p><p>BURCHETT: (INAUDIBLE.) </p><p>TRUMP: Tim, go ahead, please. </p><p>BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you -- </p><p>TRUMP: Congratulations. </p><p>BURCHETT: -- and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second -- during the -- at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not cliche and you've -- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. </p><p>BURCHETT: -- you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact. </p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they -- they hide behind the government's skirt and they -- they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then -- you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous. </p><p>TRUMP: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it. </p><p>BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to -- they need to declare it, and quit using -- they hide behind -- you know, they have their -- their -- </p><p>TRUMP: Do you think Joe Biden would do this? </p><p>BURCHETT: Heck no. </p><p>TRUMP: He wouldn't know you're alive. </p><p>BURCHETT: He'd be -- no, he'd -- </p><p>TRUMP: He doesn't know he's alive either. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker. </p><p>TRUMP: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay. So go ahead, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I -- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job. </p><p>BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans. </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, well we're going to -- and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara. </p><p>Thank you very much, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Gene, please. </p><p>SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working -- </p><p>TRUMP: Incredible. </p><p>SCALIA: -- men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread. </p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas -- wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers -- has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages. </p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in -- their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are. </p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff -- I said, \"Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\" </p><p>TRUMP: Very good. Right. </p><p>SCALIA: \"And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.'\" And I said to staff, \"Why can't we do that?\" They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order -- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, good. </p><p>SCALIA: -- that requires that change. </p><p>TRUMP: Good. </p><p>SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>-- and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security. </p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used. </p><p>But again, we saw -- signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TRUMP: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene. </p><p>SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. </p><p>BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that? </p><p>WHETZELL: We'll take it. </p><p>TRUMP: Linda, please. </p><p>MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: I love Alabama. </p><p>MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made. </p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But -- so, and in that role, I got to see every day -- </p><p>TRUMP: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA? </p><p>MCDONALD: Correct. </p><p>TRUMP: And you finally got there? </p><p>MCDONALD: I did. </p><p>TRUMP: So, what's happening? </p><p>MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with -- </p><p>TRUMP: All right. Yeah. </p><p>MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with -- </p><p>TRUMP: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year? </p><p>MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my -- </p><p>TRUMP: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>Go ahead. </p><p>MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me -- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. </p><p>MCDONALD: -- and given to someone else. So I just think -- </p><p>TRUMP: Is that the way you view it: \"given to somebody else\"? </p><p>MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and -- </p><p>TRUMP: It's a very interesting way -- </p><p>MCDONALD: -- it was then given to someone else. </p><p>TRUMP: -- of viewing it, right? </p><p>MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much. </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation -- </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: -- but that was a long time ago. But -- and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it. </p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay? </p><p>MCDONALD: I hope so. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. </p><p>Jonathan, please. </p><p>HICKS: Well, thank you for your time. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. </p><p>HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a -- I'm from a large family, and we've had three -- three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During -- as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for -- for 19 years. I've been -- </p><p>TRUMP: And that was a big deal, right? </p><p>HICKS: Yes. Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: Working -- because there's a great prestige to that. </p><p>HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: That's true. </p><p>HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the -- for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs -- mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems. </p><p>I was told in June -- early June -- that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers. </p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the -- out of all the -- all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that -- that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and -- you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates -- and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work? </p><p>TRUMP: Are you there now? Are you -- </p><p>HICKS: Well, I -- I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been -- </p><p>TRUMP: What happens on September 1st? </p><p>HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose -- </p><p>TRUMP: And you train people to take your job? </p><p>HICKS: Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: So you've worked with people to take your job. </p><p>HICKS: Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right? </p><p>HICKS: Well, I -- I think there's a big -- </p><p>TRUMP: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>HICKS: Well, I think there's a -- I think there's a big learning curve and there's -- for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this. </p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the -- to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So -- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction. </p><p>HICKS: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan. </p><p>Please. </p><p>MCKENZIE: It's -- I'm so honored to be here. </p><p>TRUMP: Honored to have you. </p><p>MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on. </p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves. </p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult. </p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that -- taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost -- it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic -- </p><p>TRUMP: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go -- </p><p>MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So -- so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to -- I think one of them is -- </p><p>HENSON: India. </p><p>MCKENZIE: India, Canada. </p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them. </p><p>TRUMP: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting. </p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else? </p><p>HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (INAUDIBLE) countries. </p><p>MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones. </p><p>TRUMP: A lot of them -- are a lot of the workers being outsourced -- </p><p>LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India. </p><p>BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me. </p><p>TRUMP: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right -- you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's -- you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else? </p><p>MCKENZIE: Just, it -- again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (LAUGHS.) </p><p>TRUMP: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying. </p><p>TRUMP: He's a legend in his own mind. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>Ken -- Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the -- the media here -- I'm sure they'll report it very accurately -- how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with -- between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're -- our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again. </p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border. </p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border. </p><p>TRUMP: That's right. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn. </p><p>TRUMP: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely. </p><p>TRUMP: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic -- not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster. </p><p>TRUMP: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking -- human traffic -- mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and -- horrible. </p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: That's right. </p><p>TRUMP: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO. </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have -- </p><p>CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership. </p><p>TRUMP: -- 27,000 soldiers. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever -- </p><p>TRUMP: It's what they say. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: -- in cooperating and securing the border. </p><p>TRUMP: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's -- </p><p>CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right. </p><p>TRUMP: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: Appreciate it. </p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up. </p><p>HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier. </p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, \"Hey! Hey! Help us out.\" </p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're -- you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much. </p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a -- worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I -- I've worked there now 35 years. </p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do -- the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission -- that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid. </p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things -- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand. </p><p>HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us. </p><p>TRUMP: Are the people that you're representing, are they -- because you represent a big group of people -- are they all nervous, like the folks at the table? </p><p>HENSON: Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: Like Wendy? </p><p>HENSON: They're going, \"Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next?\" And my answer is, \"Not on my watch, if we can help it.\" </p><p>TRUMP: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next. </p><p>HENSON: Okay. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much. </p><p>HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is -- is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority. </p><p>TRUMP: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying -- paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy. </p><p>HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here. </p><p>TRUMP: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA -- which has been running for a long time -- and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear -- and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi- -- I guess, you call it -- public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member. </p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year? </p><p>HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>But they're pretty shocked. I mean -- in fact, they -- I think the workers even -- I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money. </p><p>TRUMP: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, \"We want some information.\" And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year. </p><p>HENSON: Well, the difference -- </p><p>TRUMP: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately? </p><p>BURCHETT: Take it for one year. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: You only need it for one year. You -- </p><p>BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: Tim would take it. That's -- he'll take it only -- </p><p>BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty. </p><p>TRUMP: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway. </p><p>HENSON: So the workers -- they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long -- I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now -- </p><p>TRUMP: Right. </p><p>HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love -- </p><p>TRUMP: I'll bet. </p><p>HENSON: -- the TVA and the mission that they're really -- were put together for and would love to take that job. </p><p>TRUMP: I even think they like your President -- your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President. </p><p>HENSON: Tennessee Valley is -- that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know -- </p><p>TRUMP: \"Trump.\" Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people. </p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now -- the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons. </p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers -- I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \"Slow Biden\" and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \"Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good.\" And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are \"racists.\" </p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: Where you come up with the name \"Slow Biden\"? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, \"It's too mean; it's too nasty.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean. </p><p>TRUMP: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the -- </p><p>BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11. </p><p>TRUMP: Your son? He's 11? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President -- </p><p>BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. </p><p>(LAUGHTER.) </p><p>TRUMP: Great job. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump. </p><p>TRUMP: Oh, that's great. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very -- great job you're doing. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: Good. Thank you. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara. </p><p>PENCE: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be -- I'll just be very brief. </p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results. </p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead. </p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the -- all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country. </p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE.) </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay? </p><p>BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump. </p><p>TRUMP: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple -- which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump. </p><p>(THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS SIGNED.) </p><p>TRUMP: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (DISTRIBUTES SIGNING PEN.) </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much. </p><p>TRUMP: I have to give -- I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it -- (DISTRIBUTES SIGNING PENS.) </p><p>So here we are. </p><p>BURCHETT: (INAUDIBLE.) </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry. </p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. </p><p>(APPLAUSE.) </p><p>We're going to be -- we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything. </p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be -- it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention. </p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill -- act -- and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and -- I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country. </p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare -- it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be -- it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country -- but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country. </p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, \"I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\" And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon. </p><p>So the -- the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've -- we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: That's right. </p><p>TRUMP: Whether it's Right to Try -- that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved -- they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick. </p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because -- I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one. </p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important -- having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things. </p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them? </p><p>CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the -- especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as -- much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not -- while not becoming a burden on the country. </p><p>We've also -- the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we -- </p><p>TRUMP: Great progress. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: -- the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary. </p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was -- you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it. </p><p>TRUMP: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through. </p><p>By the way, some conservative -- very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say -- and Asian Americans -- the three, the groups. </p><p>But tremendous benefits and -- you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: So -- and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question? </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, Mr. President -- </p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend -- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: -- that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that. </p><p>TRUMP: I did. </p><p>QUESTION: So can you give us an update on -- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: -- where you're at? </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not -- how I felt about it. And I said, \"Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be.\" And here is the deal: I don't mind if -- whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- a big company, a secure company, very -- a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, \"How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name?\" The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies? </p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date -- I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody -- and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- buys it, that'll be interesting. </p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into -- it has to come into this country. </p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called \"key money,\" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything -- at least having to do with the 30 percent. </p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have -- maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal -- an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the -- really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay? </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you? </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're -- when you look at a map, this is a map of the -- I've got -- I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's -- the red is the area of most concern. (DISPLAYS A U.S. MAP.) Pretty recent map of the -- of the country. And there's a lot of -- a lot of people that -- in a lot of areas that have gotten very -- you know, better very fast. </p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, \"Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\" they would have come out and they would've said, \"It's a great -- it's a great thing.\" Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug. </p><p>So, for many years -- </p><p>QUESTION: But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective. </p><p>TRUMP: Let me finish my -- let me finish my answer. </p><p>So for many years -- it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble -- virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin -- the Z-Pak, as they call it -- and it's been very -- I happened to take it myself, the threesome. </p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I -- I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative. </p><p>And so -- so that's the story. It's -- it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand -- a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other -- in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements. </p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time -- the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things. </p><p>QUESTION: But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work. </p><p>TRUMP: I don't agree with Fauci on everything. </p><p>QUESTION: They're on your task force. </p><p>TRUMP: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want -- and I -- I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we -- we disagree on things. We disagree on things. </p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very -- very expensive. </p><p>QUESTION: But why does the -- </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it. Hold it. </p><p>QUESTION: But why does the U.S. have so many deaths? </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it. </p><p>QUESTION: The U.S. has so many deaths compared to -- </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it. </p><p>QUESTION: -- so many countries around the world. I -- </p><p>TRUMP: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given -- and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit. </p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now -- people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them. </p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems. </p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon. </p><p>Yeah, go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill? </p><p>TRUMP: I am. Oh, why? The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved. </p><p>QUESTION: Have you spoken with her? </p><p>TRUMP: I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she -- look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody -- and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second -- they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it. </p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job. </p><p>If you look at some of the states -- I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal -- the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now. </p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want -- they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City -- you see what's going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that. </p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. </p><p>QUESTION: What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your postmaster general? </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-2B11-JDPT-T0PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

How are you? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. You do whatever you need. </p><p>BURCHETT: Don't call me, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: That's very nice. Do you feel comfortable with all those cameras on your head, congressman? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>How are you? </p><p>Hello everybody. </p><p>Are we all set? </p><p>Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an Executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done, maybe ever. </p><p>I'll also be taking firm disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly, and truly betrayed American workers. And we have some of this great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room. And it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and being at the Oval Office. </p><p>We're joined by the vice president, Congressman Tim Burchett who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee, Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli. </p><p>Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. You're doing a great job. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: I'm quiet, as usual. </p><p>TRUMP: They're keeping you busy, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We're keeping you busy, Ken. </p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would layoff over two hundred American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas. The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wounds. </p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to be foreign workers and people from Tennessee and some other states right around it, are going to train them what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way. </p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H-1B regulations so that no American workers is replaced ever again. H-1B should be used for top highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor programs to destroy American jobs. </p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with it. I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things. </p><p>BLACKWELL: (OFF-MIC) Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And it's all seems to be working out pretty well. You're doing a great job. </p><p>BLACKWELL: (OFF-MIC) Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: And I thank you for it. </p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. </p><p>We have the absolute right to remove board members, and the board makes the decision. I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to--replace the board. And the board is the one, the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person. </p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interests of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? $8 million. He's the highest paid government official of any country anywhere in the world. </p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a government. It might be a public-private. It may be something--a long time ago it was established, the Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep swamp things happening and it's a disgrace. </p><p>But he gets a $8 million per year and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know who would take that job. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That's not a very hard job, when you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right? </p><p>Public service is just that. Those who take these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay, he would have gone for less. </p><p>You could have had him for four million, six million, seven million, two million, one million, probably five hundred thousand a year. But the new CEO must be paid no more than five hundred thousand dollars a year, which is still a significant amount more than the president of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I have donated. From what I hear, I'm the only president to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that, but I donate my full salary. I don't take it. </p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars. We want the TVA to take action on this immediately, lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.  </p><p>I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I--I don't know. Let's see. So were talking about Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states. They are--every one of them.  </p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words, \"You're fired.\" You're fired. It's ridiculous. A man is getting $8 million. It would be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he had made more. I don't know, but I doubt it. But it would be interesting to see.  </p><p>He got this position--it must've been politically inspired because I can think of probably almost everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.  </p><p>So with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it, but he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky. He could've kept a plant opening open in Kentucky if you wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant and he didn't do that, didn't did he, congressman? He wouldn't do that.  </p><p>We asked him to do that. He didn't want to do it. We said that's okay and here we are doing what we're doing today. So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want that saving--much lower salary. I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings, and that's a pretty substantial number. So Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words?  </p><p>LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.  </p><p>We were founded--we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the end--and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by outsourcing and off shoring of our skilled labor jobs. And Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here on behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority. </p><p>We appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans. Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers under your administration can continue to provide great services to the American people as they have since 1933 shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.  </p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm, outsourcing, and off shoring have done to our nation's productive classes and it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs. Thank you, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: So you're the one that took the ad about me. I didn't know that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I was just saying you know, I think he's the one who took this really vicious--like you, I heard this guy for $8 million and I have nothing to do with that. I said what's that? But actually, you brought something very important because when I looked into it, I said this guy is actually making $8 million a year and you did the ad.  </p><p>So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a--feeding pot for a long time and a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay? So that's it. So we're going to make that--I see. I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize. </p><p>LYNN: I do realize that Mr. President. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But if I could-- </p><p>TRUMP: --I accept your apology. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said who is your audience and I said just one person. He's the only one-- </p><p>TRUMP: --He's smart-- </p><p>LYNN: --That would do this and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley Authority </p><p>UNKNOWN: The only one with any guts to do it. </p><p>LYNN: Absolutely. </p><p>TRUMP: Do you want to--I'll tell you though, I have to say, Kevin, the ad was very appropriate and, while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board and ultimately the board controls the decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the-- </p><p>LYNN: --1933, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, so it was done during the FDR days and it's been, you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years and they have basically nobody watching over them and the board isn't watching over. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.  </p><p>But for a--essentially, I would say for a federal employee to be paid $8 million, now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members. How much are they paid? Because usually what happens is they pay and then he says, you know, I think you ought to get more money and everybody's making a lot of money and your--your pricing for electric and utility starts going up and people say I wonder why.  </p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and it don't work well. But will discuss that separately. But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin. Please, Stacy. How are you? </p><p>WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, I am Stacy Whetzell, son of a sharecropper. First, I want to thank you for being the great American president you are in caring about and looking after the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.  </p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have seven children and 14 grandchildren. </p><p>I began working for TVA in 1975 as a partner apprentice. Currently, on the system administrator on TVA's core team that's is responsible for installing a $20 million commuter system. Our team in the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the work--outstanding performance we've done.  </p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July 23 that IT leadership had decided our--decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated in our work done to others. This brings the total plan outsource jobs to over 200 in TVA technology information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.  </p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H-1B workers. We are required to train these--our placements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train, but not retain.  </p><p>Using H-1B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning the entire community--American communities outside upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as it certainly as our 50 year build up and dependence on China for manufacturing data.  </p><p>Thank you, President Trump for beginning to reverse that half-century mistake. American patriots will forever be grateful that you also acted to blunt the misguided and out-of-control H-1B worker program. I thank you for putting American first and acting to stop this tragedy. </p><p>TRUMP: Well, you're a very powerful speaker and so powerful that we just got a call. Mark just brought this in from the TVA CEO and he's indicated very strong willingness to reverse course and-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>That something. So it must've been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I'm talking and then all of a sudden, I get the note. So he's looking to change course and reverse it and that's good. Now maybe he'll take a major cut in his salary to. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that and maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, Gratis (SP), right? Your group. That's great, isn't it? </p><p>HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers, on the union president, IPG Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message--a stop order from the president in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said I'm working on that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>TRUMP: You did a good job. Everybody in this room did a good job. </p><p>HENSON: I appreciate you, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And congressman? You have my endorsement. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President </p><p>TRUMP: Okay, you had it anyway, but you have it now. That's a great job. The only congressman in the room. I'll tell you, Tim, great job. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you very much. </p><p>TRUMP: That's only phase one. Phase two is--a man shouldn't be paid $8 million a year to run I think that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it. He didn't build it. He went there and he's been there and he gets a lot of money and it shouldn't be. $500,000 is a lot of money, right? </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care. But you know, it shouldn't happen. So that's a start. </p><p>[*]TRUMP: To start and I think we should find out what board members make, okay, because I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily. Congratulations, Stacy. Really good. Please, go ahead. </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir, Mr. President. Thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon to be father this November. My wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line--I'm the son of a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service and with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley. </p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained--training a contractor from an H-1B dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because-- </p><p>TRUMP: --You're doing great. </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: You had a big victory already. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LITTLEJOHN: I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us. </p><p>TRUMP: I appreciate it and thank you very much and you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick too. Thank you. Wendy, please. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah, I'm Wendy Turner and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was coming in to say, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids and I also take care of my mom, what we were going to do going forward. So, thank you-- </p><p>TRUMP: --And, this was--everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess, right? If you do, even after 19 years. So, everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right? </p><p>TURNER: Yeah. </p><p>TRUMP: That's a terrible thing. You mean they're waiting for it to happen to them. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that-- </p><p>TRUMP: --You've been training people? </p><p>TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: And, so did they lay you off yet or are you not sure? </p><p>TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st. </p><p>TRUMP: So, you're training people to take your job, but whatever, right? </p><p>TURNER: They--they told us to-- </p><p>TRUMP: --And, where are the people from that you're training? </p><p>TURNER: All over the place. We--everything's done-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Are they from other countries? </p><p>TURNER: They're here on the soil now. I don't know their status as far as-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead. </p><p>TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know--I know the company--we (INAUDIBLE) I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I--I don't know for sure where everyone is. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay, well we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them, because they're brave to be here actually Sara, so you'll check that out, right? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Let's see that they get their jobs back. </p><p>TURNER: Thank you very much. </p><p>TRUMP: Because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people but I also want people that are really good workers, that did a great job, because, you know, people can be let go, should be able to, if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think--I'll be you are. But, I said, I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go, right Tim? That's-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --Absolutely-- </p><p>TRUMP: --to me, very important. Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens, okay? </p><p>TURNER: --Thank you-- </p><p>TRUMP: We're--we're going to push it hard. Chuck, please. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is and I sincerely appreciate your time today, okay? I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people at the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience. Now I'm a certified security professional here, okay? </p><p>Working with the people at Tennessee Valley, how I've learned, just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant and that is the reason that I'm really here today. </p><p>TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of power, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high voltage transmission-- </p><p>TRUMP: --How does that compare to other big utilities would you say? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right at the top of them. There's no question about it and very significant. Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area. </p><p>TRUMP: Yes, very big. That's a lot. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And, in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams that produce power from 29 to do flood control. Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly in that case. Yeah, three major power plants and nuclear power plants-- </p><p>TRUMP: --What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --(INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Huh? </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert right down there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) </p><p>But, the bottom line of it and the consequence of this is a very--very important player not only in the southeast region, but four bases nationally, okay? And, today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks, cyberattacks, testing its network here, right? It's imperative to have experienced knowledgeable employees that handle that situation, okay? </p><p>TRUMP: --Right-- </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: And, to find an example of this, I just kind of--you know, it's a little bit (INAUDIBLE), but the great power outage of 2003-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Right-- </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: --was affected by a software glitch, okay, that impacted it and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours. </p><p>TRUMP: I remember that very well. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related--or familiar with that. So, it just really points to a significance of having qualified vetted people (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: --dedicated to that job. </p><p>TRUMP: That wouldn't happen with you, would it, huh? It wouldn't happen. </p><p>TURNER: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: And, then just if I could quickly, two other quick points. Basically this outsourcing agreement could impact--the Tennessee Valley is always--our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the valley by $88 million to these local economies here and for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 300 to 400 percent increase for these families and how they manage it. And, I think-- </p><p>TRUMP: --You're going to lose--you're going to lose people and you're firing people that are--they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned and it's not a fair situation. Go ahead. Let's--let's go, Chuck. </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Final point. The effort here to make America great again, okay, reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate remanufacturing companies--companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending the millions of dollars from one particular consulting firm, $15 million to-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Who's the consulting firm? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>TRUMP: --You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm? </p><p>CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was-- </p><p>TRUMP: --We just found another nugget of gold. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's--I care about it. You spend $15 to one consulting firm? </p><p>BLACKWELL: It's not a consulting--that's one of the companies they're picking up and it's Capgemini and that's $15 million just for that one company. </p><p>TRUMP: How many--how many are there? </p><p>BLACKWELL: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems that TVA is-- </p><p>TRUMP: --And, they're paying tremendous amounts of money? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes and our workers are (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>TRUMP: --They're very political people. You notice it's a very political group of people you just mentioned. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Really? </p><p>TRUMP: Not to me. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Just know that-- </p><p>TRUMP: Not to me. I don't care. I don't care who they are, but they--they are very political. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Well, I mean, when these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence and TVA says your matrix for your performance is above--it doesn't make sense. What you're doing, I cannot tell you how much it means to me and for these workers. It--it--I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing and nobody can touch them and I believe today they've been touched. </p><p>TRUMP: --(INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BLACKWELL: They've been touched. </p><p>TRUMP: No, it's a racket, what we just found that out. No, it's a racket. I mean, I understand. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms and they do it for much less, much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Well, they're not the consulting firm. They're the ones that actually are going to take these people's jobs. </p><p>TRUMP: That's worse. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes, it is worse. So, I mean-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Tim, go ahead, please. </p><p>BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Congratulations-- </p><p>BURCHETT: --and the Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the second--during the--at the end of the Second World War and Dad came over from the Pacific and married her and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not cliche and you've-- </p><p>TRUMP: --Yeah-- </p><p>BURCHETT: --you've highlighted that so much with the trades and others things and I'm very appreciative of the fact. But, I tell you what, dadgummit if TVA wants to be Duke Electric, let them be Duke Electric, but they're not and they--they hide behind the government skirt and they--they use imminent domain and their arrogance is beyond belief. </p><p>You know, when they had the Ashville, people died and then, you know, and then they're just these poor country folks are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous. </p><p>TRUMP: No, that's right and by the way, in Kentucky, where we wanted to have a plant open, there were a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, no they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them and finally we have a president with the guts that understands business and government and if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to--they need to-- </p><p>[*]BURCHETT: --declared and quit using--They hide behind--you know, have their--there-- </p><p>TRUMP: Do you think Joe Biden would do this? </p><p>BURCHETT: Heck, no. </p><p>TRUMP: He would know you are alive. He would know--he doesn't know he's alive either. </p><p>BURCHETT: (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TRUMP: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? He wouldn't have a clue. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Okay, so go ahead, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President, I'm just honored to be here. </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I'm honored that you're here and you've done a fantastic job.  </p><p>BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.  </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, well, we're going to and we're going to get this finished, too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Eugene, please.  </p><p>SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this--this meeting has, I think, shown the very human impact on individual working-- </p><p>TRUMP: Is incredible. </p><p>SCALIA: Men and women of a--of a practice that's actually pretty widespread. And the way it's worked on our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas, wants to use the H-1B program for high skilled workers, has to file an attestation with us that the Labor Department saying American workers are going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H-1B workers. And I they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages. </p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing the TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in, their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.  </p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your labor secretary recently, and I said to my staff, I said, well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company where they're actually going to be working and supervised also file an application. </p><p>TRUMP: Very good, right. </p><p>SCALIA: And say we're not going to affect U.S. workers either. And I said to my staff, why can't we do that? They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today you're going to be signing an order that requires that change.  </p><p>TRUMP: Oh, good. Good. </p><p>SCALIA: So going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are--  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>And--and--and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.  </p><p>And I just want to mention one of the things we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the secretary of labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of the H-1B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That the authority has never been used.  </p><p>But again, we saw--signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that, too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TRUMP: Very good. You're going to find a lot. Thank you very much.  </p><p>SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.  </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Good work, Stacy. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TRUMP: Right, Stacy, right. You like that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You like that. We'll take it.  </p><p>Linda, please, go ahead.  </p><p>MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for meeting with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership.  </p><p>TRUMP: I love Alabama.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I love Alabama.  </p><p>MCDONALD: That's a promise too my mother made(PH). </p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in Northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal is to work at TVA. That was my American dream.  </p><p>After years of sacrifice and hard work to achieve, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But--so, and in that role, I got to see every day-- </p><p>TRUMP: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA. </p><p>MCDONALD: Correct.  </p><p>TRUMP: And you finally got there.  </p><p>MCDONALD: I did. </p><p>TRUMP: So what's happening?  </p><p>MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with--  </p><p>TRUMP: All right, yeah. </p><p>MCDONALD: Yeah. So I here I(PH) am faced with-- </p><p>TRUMP: And you have to have all of these consulting firms making $10-$15 million a year.  </p><p>MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my-- </p><p>TRUMP: And the man that heads it making $1 million a year. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Go ahead.  </p><p>MCDONALD: I feel like my American dream was being stolen from me.  </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah.  </p><p>MCDONALD: And given to someone else, so. I just think that-- </p><p>TRUMP: Is that the way you view it, given to somebody else?  </p><p>MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me and given to someone else. </p><p>TRUMP: That's a very interesting way of viewing it, right? </p><p>MCDONALD: So, I thank you for--for listening to it us because--because it felt for so long like no one was even listening to us, so thank you very much.  </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara and we worked on the Disney situation. But that was a long time ago. But, yeah, you know, this has been happening for a while, so we're taking care of it.  </p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. Let's see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised, okay. </p><p>MCDONALD: I hope so. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. </p><p>Jonathan, please. </p><p>HICKS: Thank you for your time.  </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you.  </p><p>HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I' m--I'm from a large family and we've had three--three members of our family who have served in the--the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area. And started my career at TVA in 2001 as a--as an IT intern. </p><p>There--as soon as I graduated, I got a full time job there and I've been there for--for 19 years. I-- I've been-- </p><p>TRUMP: That was a big deal, right? </p><p>HICKS: Yes--yes. </p><p>TRUMP: Working because it's a great prestige to that. </p><p>HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, it's true. </p><p>HICKS: I--I've spent my time there working for River Operations, for their--their group and helping them, you know, have programs, mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems. </p><p>I was told then in June, early June that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my written notice in September. And that the workers that I've been training, there's been five-plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H-1B type workers. I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that--that we do, at least for the river operations, in that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the--out of all the all of these dams.  </p><p>And, you know, is this something that--that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and, you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work? </p><p>TRUMP: Are you there now?  </p><p>HICKS: Well, I--I've been put on nonwork status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but-- </p><p>TRUMP: What happens on September 1? </p><p>HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would-- </p><p>TRUMP: And you trained people to take your job.  </p><p>HICKS: Yes, yes. </p><p>TRUMP: So you work with people to take your job?  </p><p>HICKS: Yes.  </p><p>TRUMP: You've taught them like almost everything, you know, but plenty, right? Maybe not--maybe you held back a couple of secrets. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>HICKS: (INAUDIBLE) learning curves and for--for the knowledge that--that they do there for River Operations, I think it takes several years of--of understanding the job in order to be able--to to do this. The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with the utilities. They've never dealt with power generation. They've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydro generation. And so to say that they're ready to go was is--is a misstatement, so. </p><p>TRUMP: Well, we'll see how it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction. Thank you. Thank you. Jonathan. </p><p>Please.  </p><p>MCKENZIE: I'm so honored to be here.  </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. We're honored to have you. </p><p>MCKENZIE: My name's Renae McKenzie. And I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other White-Collar workers. But I've work really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and applications that they actually custom-built themselves. But so many TBI employees have been there from the beginning of their careers, so to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non American, is very difficult, but I think one of the hardest things to witness is what he's actually doing to themselves. </p><p>I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley and to be taking that--taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost--it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for was to come out economic-- </p><p>TRUMP: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here? </p><p>MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So--so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it 's--it's going to France. It's really going to I think one them is India. </p><p>UNKNOWN: India. </p><p>MCKENZIE: Canada. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Ireland. </p><p>MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them. </p><p>TRUMP: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways, too. But we're stopping it, as you noticed. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>TRUMP: It's very interesting. So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else? </p><p>MCKENZIE: That's the main groups rate there.  </p><p>TRUMP: A lot of the--a lot of the work is being outsourced to those countries.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: In many--all these firms, H-1B visa dependent and--and 70 percent of H-1B visa workers in the United States come from one country, mainly India.  </p><p>BURCHETT: And, you know, Mr. President, I worry, too, about the national security. We're during a pandemic. People are out of work. And our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that maybe their loyalty isn't to this great country. </p><p>[*]BURCHETT: That bothers me. </p><p>TRUMP: You know, with TVA more so than most companies, you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power and you're right. You're right about that, Tim. No is a very good statement. Anything else? </p><p>BURCHETT: Just it--again, at such an honor to be in your presence. </p><p>TRUMP: It's a great honor. </p><p>LAUGHTER </p><p>It is my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BURCHETT: Look, and I tend to be very quiet with him. </p><p>TRUMP: He's a legend in his own mind. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Ken--Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple seconds while we have the media here, I'm sure they'll report it very accurately how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement because I know you been working with Gene and everybody very hard. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You are solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we are--our two agencies at your direction from June are going to do is resolve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again. </p><p>But on the--on the border, we are seeing success with your leadership with Mexico in the Northern Triangle countries, the relationships you've helped us forge last year in 2019 are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with--with the coronavirus and the task force of course led by the vice president. And the ability since March 2 in force the public health order they are has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border. </p><p>There's still people getting away more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us. This year, they're running from us at the border. It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we are apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under 2 hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turnaround. </p><p>TRUMP: It used to take, and some cases, years. Years. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Absolutely. </p><p>TRUMP: It's been incredible what happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? And we have now about almost 270--71 miles of wall. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the border patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic. Not just people, but drugs as well and so forth. So it's extremely effective and it's going up faster and faster and faster. </p><p>TRUMP: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they'd traffic and human traffic, mostly women and children, but mostly women and they'd bring them across the border taped up and horrible. And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they make a left turn. Then make a right and then a left into the United States. </p><p>He says and now we just keep driving and there's this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it and drones on top of it and people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Real force multiplier for the border patrol I know from-- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, and Mexico is helping us a lot. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: A lot. </p><p>TRUMP: They have 27,000 soldiers. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year, but the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best we have really had in decades, if not forever incorporating and securing </p><p>TRUMP: They have a very good president, who was just here two weeks ago. He's really doing a good, good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border and they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down and we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's what we're doing. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>TRUMP: you're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Ken. Appreciate it. Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up. </p><p>HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm that union president from the workers there represented by this move at TVA has taken. I've met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier. </p><p>We've really tried to get our first voice heard. We've been screaming hey, hey, help us out. Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, put a(PH) commercial together, and we're, you know that got your(PH) attention and we appreciate it so much. </p><p>I've lived my life in the Tennessee Valley region. My uncle was--worked at TVA during World War II. He laid his job aside and went and served in--in Paris in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work and I--I've worked there now 35 years. </p><p>This means a lot to the people of Tennessee Valley region more than you'll ever know. I know that consulting companies look at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do--the same consulting companies are looking at what to do with transmission work. That transmission, that grid has got to be protected at all costs. I mean, we've got to. </p><p>We cannot afford to let someone else who may not have the loyalty to our nation have the grid. And I think that some of these workers at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest things they said to me. There's a large chance that something--that we would be breached and we can't do that. And I--we tried to say all those things-- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, with our people running it, very small chance, from what I understand. </p><p>HENSON: Yes. Right, with the right people running it, right. But you can't give it to just anybody, and that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you're doing for us. </p><p>TRUMP: Are they people that you're representing--are they--because you represent a big group of people. Are they all nervous like the folks at the table like Wendy who are-- </p><p>HENSON: Yes. They're going are we next, gay, is this what's coming next? And I--might answer is not on my watch if I can help it. </p><p>TRUMP: Tell them no. They're not next. </p><p>HENSON: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: I think you can tell them. I think we can save it. So thank you very much. </p><p>HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the valley, service to the people of the Valley. And to this nation is--is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority. </p><p>TRUMP: So right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying--paying heads of this whole thing $1 million a year. You'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy. </p><p>HENSON: Well, people over profit and that's what they're doing here. </p><p>TRUMP: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA, which has been running for a long time, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing, there are many people can do it, what did they hear when they hear and they think of government, you know, it's sort of semi, I guess you call it public-private, but there's no private, really when you think of it. So it's a board member. What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year, which is, by the way, I said before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear--did they know he makes $8 million a year? </p><p>HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>They're pretty shocked. I mean, I think the workers even--I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money. </p><p>TRUMP: But people of none. I've known actually before the commercial because we were looking at--we sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying we want some information. And you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year. </p><p>HENSON: Well, the difference is-- </p><p>TRUMP: It's the most sought after job--it has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately? </p><p>BURCHETT: I'd take it for one year. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TRUMP: You only needed for one year. </p><p>BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter. </p><p>TRUMP: Tim would take it. That's it--he'll take it only--only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway. </p><p>HENSON: So the workers, they--they are surprised at that. But you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long, I tell people I started when I was eight because I can't believe I've worked there now, but that--the truth is there are very capable people at TVA that love TVA and the mission that there really--we're put together for. And would love to take that job. </p><p>TRUMP: I even think they like your president, your current president anyway. I'm not sure about the past president. </p><p>HENSON: Tennessee Valley is--the boats on the lake all say-- </p><p>TRUMP: Trump, yeah. No they're great--the great people. And say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people. Sarah, why don't you just discuss it real quick and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly, okay? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Of course, President Trump. Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and then--and the immigrants. Right now, the way it was before you started working on it, it's always been big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons. </p><p>And the Protect U.S. Workers endorsed you in 2016. We endorsed you in 2020 and we know for a fact that Slow Biden and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good and if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are racist. </p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now and the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is, you're actually benefiting the big tech, billionaires, and universities. And that is not what immigration is about in this country. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: where did you come up with the name Slow Biden? You know, so many people want me to use that term and I say it's to mean. It's too nasty. And you just come up with that--where did that come from? Is that the-- </p><p>BLACKWELL: My son actually who's 11. </p><p>TRUMP: Your son who's 11? </p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TRUMP: If he's 11 and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be president. Anyway, great job. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Pay your son $15 million-- </p><p>BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, at the event, my son and he had a Thor and he dressed him up like President Trump. </p><p>TRUMP: Oh, that's great. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara, very good. Great job you're doing. </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much. Thank you for all you do. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Okay, Mike, go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara. </p><p>PENCE: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be--I'll just be very brief. Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women of America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first. </p><p>You said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration and we deliver real results. And, today, we see all of that happening right in front of us because of your leadership, indicated during this meeting that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H-1B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And, I--I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all of those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead. </p><p>But, I also just want to say finally to all of the--all the great Americans who have gathered here and been willing to speak up, know that with the Executive order the president is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the president is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all and pulling together multiple agencies to do that and I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers of TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country. </p><p>And, I know I speak on behalf of the president and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this president to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) document now. Is that okay? </p><p>UNKNOWN: I would love that. Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: All right, and it's a very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interest of the American workers, which is very simple, which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today, okay? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you so much, president. </p><p>TRUMP: Here, give that to Sara because she was (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you so much. </p><p>TRUMP: I have to give one (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. We'll pass them on this side (INAUDIBLE). So, here we are. Yeah, I'll get you one too. Don't worry. </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) </p><p>Got it? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you. </p><p>TRUMP: So, thank you very much, everybody. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So, we're going to be--we're going to be discussing very shortly an immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. It's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything. </p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be--it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to and I think it'll be bipartisan in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there and probably some people won't. We're going to have that and we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention. </p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing healthcare bill--act and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get and I mean in a positive way and I think it'll be very popular and it will be a--it'll be a great thing for our country. </p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But, immigration and healthcare, it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit based, but it'll be--it'll be great for the worker and it'll be great for people coming into our country but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country. </p><p>You see that. You see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, \"I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\" And, you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But, all they do is complain about our country and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon. </p><p>So, the--the merit based immigration is going to be incredible and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see and we've done much of that, if you look at some of the legislation that we've passed. Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've done--we've gotten things passed that nobody thought would be possible, whether it's right to try. That's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved. They're in a line of approval and it takes some time. </p><p>We've cut the time in half by the way for approval by the FDA. But, people are sick. We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because--I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things. But, I got that taken care of, so right to try was a very important one. </p><p>Getting veteran's choice was so important, having veteran's choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got veteran's choice. We got veteran's accountability because we have so many other things, so many things. </p><p>And, on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible, right? Do you want to name a couple of them? </p><p>CUCCINELLI: Making enormous progress in the--especially in the regulatory arena, reestablishing the--the 140 year old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet as--much like Sara had said and to add to this country and not--while not becoming a burden on the country. We've also--the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do, but we--the amount of improvement-- </p><p>TRUMP: Improvements.-- </p><p>CUCCINELLI: in three years is just extraordinary. That and one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is the criminal justice reform, which was--you know, lots of people before you talked about it and this is the first administration to do it. </p><p>TRUMP: Nobody else could have gotten that done. </p><p>CUCCINELLI: That's right.-- </p><p>TRUMP: Nobody. We really thank Ken but we thank a lot of people that came through. By the way, some conservative--very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it, but we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. </p><p>Biggest (INAUDIBLE) is African Americans and Hispanic Americans I would say and Asian Americans (INAUDIBLE) the groups, but tremendous benefits and, you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would have never thought would have supported it, not for bad reasons, but they would have never supported it and they actually led the way. It was pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim. </p><p>BURCHETT: Yes, sir. </p><p>TRUMP: So, you were helpful actually and I appreciate it and thank you very much. Anybody have a question? </p><p>QUESTION: Yes, Mr. President. </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah, please. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, on TikTok, you said openly-- </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah-- </p><p>QUESTION: That you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke to CEO of Microsoft after that. </p><p>TRUMP: I did. </p><p>QUESTION: So could you give us an update on where you're at? </p><p>TRUMP: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not--how I felt about it and I said look, it can't be controlled for security reasons by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be. </p><p>And here's the deal, I don't mind if, whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, a big company, as secure company, very--very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say how do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name? The name is hot. The brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies? </p><p>So my personal opinion was you're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated and I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date. I set a date of around September 15, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody, and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else buys it, that will be interesting. </p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else I said a very substantial of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we are making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights unless we give it to them. </p><p>So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come in to--it has to come into this country. It's a little bit like the landlord tenant. Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called key money or they pay something, but the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money because without the United States, they don't have anything, at least having to do with the 30 percent. </p><p>So I told them that. I think we're going to have--maybe held a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset but it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal so that Treasury of the--will of the Treasury I guess you would say of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money, okay? </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President-- </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public-health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you? </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're--when you look at a map, this is a map of the--I've sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's--that is the area of most concern. It's pretty recent map of the--of the country. And there's a lot of--a lot of people that--in a lot of areas that have gotten very, you know, better very fast. </p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If I would've said do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances, they would've come out and they would've said it's a great--it's a great thing. Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They wanted very badly. It's a great malaria drug. So for many years-- </p><p>QUESTION: (--INAUDIBLE--) </p><p>TRUMP: So for many years--let me finish my--let me finish my answer. So for many years, it's I guess 60 years it's been a malaria drug. Very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus and it caused no trouble--virtually nothing in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You had the zinc and you add the azithromycin, the Z-pack, as they call it, and it's been very--I happen to take it myself, the threesome. I took of myself for a period of two weeks. I've been--I had no problem. </p><p>I had no problem whatsoever. And importantly, I you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay, I'm very happy about that. Negative. And so that's the story. It's--it's very highly thought of. </p><p>Interestingly, a great doctor from what I understand, a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other in France as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. </p><p>Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements. I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time--the reason I took it, you know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive and I took it for that reason just because I've heard good things. </p><p>QUESTION: But Fauci says it doesn't work, Giroir says it doesn't work-- </p><p>TRUMP: Well, I don't agree with Fauci on everything. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) task force </p><p>TRUMP: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want, and I like them, I get along with him actually great, but he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. </p><p>So it doesn't mean he's a bad person because he's not. He's a good person. I like him. But we--we disagree on things. We disagree on things. Now, I will say this, we've done an amazing job with ventilators. We are supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make. Very complex. Very complicated machines. A--very expensive-- </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it. Hold it-- </p><p>QUESTION: So many deaths-- </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it-- </p><p>QUESTION: The U.S. has so many deaths (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>TRUMP: Hold it-- </p><p>QUESTION: So many countries around the world. </p><p>TRUMP: Fake news. CNN. Hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given--and not me. I'm not talking about me. Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit. </p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now. People that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. Right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding. Have Italy back, you have Spain back, you have friends back, you have Germany back. You have a lot of countries. And that's not to knock them. </p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was no source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now, so that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow in Russia is having tremendous problems. </p><p>What China unleashed was of very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job. Great job. And you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon. Yeah, go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill? </p><p>TRUMP: I am. Oh, I am by(PH), the fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved. I'm totally involved. </p><p>QUESTION: Have you spoken to her? </p><p>TRUMP: And we're going to be doing some things that are very good because we don't think that she--look, but Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody, and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second, they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus or whatever you want to call it. </p><p>They want to bailout cities and say states. They want bailout money. They want $1 trillion in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities and a lot of people don't want to give them $1 trillion to reward them for doing a bad job. </p><p>If you look at some of the states, I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people, they're not interested in unemployment, they're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal, the evictions. They want to evict--a lot of people are going to be evicted. But I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to Executive orders and were looking at that very seriously right now. </p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want--they're slow rolling it and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bailout radical-left governors and radical-left mayors like in Portland and in places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City. You see what's going on over there. They allowed cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it. They want $1 trillion and will really not interested in that. Okay, thank you very much. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>UNKNOWN: Let's go, guys. Come on, press. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Let's go. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Let's go. </p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much </p><p>QUESTION: Come on, guys. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you come on, Jim. </p><p>TRUMP: Thank you, Jim, very much.

Tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's \"The Five.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams, along with Dana Perino, Jesse Watters, Dan Bongino, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. President Trump promising a big crackdown on violence in cities, it comes as he's also picking up the endorsement of a top police organization.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The group had previously supported President Obama and Joe Biden. All that happening while the person seen here attacking New York City police has been arrested. The New York police department's top uniformed officer among the four injured. Here's what he just told Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a lot of animosity towards the police. And we are stealing (ph) -- not just in the protests when these anarchists take over but on the streets, on the street corners there is a feeling that they don't have to listen to the police and that they are willing to fight the police officers. We need our elected throughout the entire city to stand up and say that they support our police.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: And the head of the Department of Homeland Security now accusing politicians in Portland, Oregon, of enabling quote, \"violent anarchists.\" Federal agents in that city using teargas to break up protesters trying to set a CHOP-like autonomous zone. Jesse, let me begin with you. This is obviously part of the president's strategy.</p><p>The National Association of Police Organizations announced their endorsement of President Trump on Shannon Bream's show last night. And the president recently said the police are not being treated fairly in this country. But I note that two-thirds of Americans say police violence against the public is a serious problem. So is the president out of sync with the public on this issue?</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: No. I think the media is out of sync. I think the public, when you ask them, what is bigger problem, homicides or police maybe being too aggressive once in a while. I think they'd go with homicides, Juan. Now, I think everybody around this table agrees that I'm the most objective person here, so what I want to do is I want to look -- what's so funny?</p><p>I want to look at these anti-police movement objectively, all right? So it's been a month and a half since George Floyd tragically died. What are the tangible results of the movement? Let's judge the results here, specifically. Homicides are up everywhere. Hundreds of people have been injured, police officers included. Billions of dollars in property, people are fleeing cities.</p><p>They're buying weapons, COVID-19 was spread, cancel culture got out of control. There have been at least 20 people killed in the riots as a result of this, so what were the accomplishments, because Democrats blocked police reform. What, a statue is toppled? The Redskins change their name. Someone resigned from the New York Times, really?</p><p>Is that what the BLM movement gave birth to? Is that really it? Because at this point, you have to say to yourself is this movement objectively -- has it been a bust? Because I don't think this move in opinion if -- you can't quantify that at a poll because I don't even believe some of the polls about what people think about police or the black lives matter movement.</p><p>I'm talking about action. And the action has been tragic. There has been a move towards anarchy and fear and violence, not towards unity and peace as a result of this. So all the people that stoked these fires, the elite people in the media or the elected politicians, they need to look themselves in the mirror and say, am I proud of what this has accomplished?</p><p>Am I satisfied with the result of this movement? Because I think it's just -- people are now picking up the pieces as a result of this. And what's another four years later in the next election? We're going to do this all over again. People are hurting. So I don't see this as a positive movement at this point. I think people are hurt and scared now.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK, all right. So Dana, let's pick up on what Jesse is talking about, because the president said in an interview this week with CBS that more white people are killed by police than black people. And I think that's true in absolute numbers. But of course, blacks are a smaller percentage of the population and his critics are pointing out that blacks are a small percentage of the population.</p><p>And his critics are pointing out that blacks are more likely to be shot and killed by police than whites. So why is the president not showing any sensitivity to that side of the argument?</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: You know, he has done a lot of interviews this week where he has been asked things that were not having to do with Coronavirus or the economic condition of the country. And on this one, I think part of it is just knowing to how to read the room a little bit, the room being the country. And it's not that he was factually inaccurate.</p><p>But there is room here for empathy and he has shown that. And at the same time, he is looking at his home city of New York, going through horrific violence, the police officers feeling completely demoralized. You had the actual police chief be injured in this. You had crime spiking way up, and then you have the fact that you de-funded a billion dollars from that police department, disbanded the anti-crime unit.</p><p>And they put forward a piece of legislation that maybe Dan can explain a little bit more. But it basically says that the police officers are not allowed to touch a suspect, if they are under arrest, anywhere on the torso, which basically means you are not able to arrest. So the crime will continue to go up. I think those are the two things actually that could maybe be turned around pretty quickly if the NYPD was willing to do that.</p><p>And I also feel like when you talk about law and order, people are concerned about that. It is not something that you can just deal with in New York City, when you see it in Portland, when you see it in Washington, Los Angeles. I mean, it is nationwide that every single city is dealing with this everywhere. But we know how this works.</p><p>This starts to pop up in other cities, it migrates other places. It took years to get us to the place where we had a very safe city in New York. And it takes a just a couple of weeks to destroy that unless somebody does something pretty quickly.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. So Dan, picking up on the question Dana was asking you, we have seen an increase in gun sales now after the marches that followed George Floyd's death. And of course, people are saying some of this is a result of racial anxiety, you know, fear that there's going to be more racial unrest or may be racial violence. So is racial concern behind the spike in gun purchases?</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS HOST: No. No one is saying that, Juan, only, you know, the liberal nuts are saying that. People are buying guns because they don't feel safe. Adding some racial connotation to it that nobody has any evidence of whatsoever is just liberal nut bags. That's not a real thing people are saying just to be clear. And it's kind of rational.</p><p>I mean, wouldn't you say? I mean, if you are watching your community being burned to the ground, your store being burned to the ground, people attacking innocent, hit them with canes and riot while the police are hamstrung and not able to respond. What would you do? I mean, it would be irrational to not want to defend yourself, right?</p><p>I mean, I'm not crazy, right? And secondly, I think President Trump, that's how the segment started that he's -- the crackdown is coming. He's kind of done asking at this point. He doesn't need the mayor's authority in Chicago and New York to go in and enact -- and enforce federal crimes. He doesn't need them at all. He's tried to work with them.</p><p>He's tried to play nice. They are not interested. They are interested in chaos and promoting chaos. He can send in the FBI, Secret Service, DEA, IRS, ATF, you name it for a task force tomorrow and enforce federal crimes. He doesn't need their permission. And I think he's done asking and I applaud that. One more point, I've heard a lot of commentary by liberals on cable news and in radio.</p><p>The first step here is acknowledging a problem. And if I hear one more person try to say there isn't a crime wave or this is some kind of figment of our imagination, or it's just due to the hot summer, I'm going to lose my mind. That is absolutely not true. It is the tangible result of pulling anti-crime officers off the street, bail reform, and losing broken policing in favor of bail reform. I mean, the evidence is everywhere and ignoring it just makes anyone promoting that propaganda looks silly. I'm very sorry.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I disagree with you but we will talk about that later. Let me get to Emily. Emily, Representative Ilhan Omar was in the Washington Post with an op-ed column today. She says President Trump is being unfair to her when he says that she wants to dismantle America because she says the protests need to go beyond the police and call for better schools, housing, healthcare, and jobs. Do you think she has a point, Emily?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I don't, because she wasn't calling for that in that specific way. And she 100 percent stands for the destruction of America. But I want to focus on something else for a moment. I want to echo Jesse and Dan's point as well as the NYPD chiefs points, which is that the violence and the destruction has been totally emboldened by the ineffectiveness of these local leaders.</p><p>I wanted to show support for Seattle's law enforcement. So last night, I teamed with a local restaurant and we delivered dinner to the North Precinct. And seeing their -- hearing their stories and their concerns and witnessing their low morale was so distressing. Our small gesture had the biggest impact on them because these guys are flying solo.</p><p>And they're also mourning the loss of an officer that was shot and killed to death, Jonathan Shoop, on Monday night. And they are questioning whether their community supports them because we know the mayor doesn't. And the common thread all night in the conversations that we had with them was that this time is so different. These are veterans, you guys. These are not rookies.</p><p>They have seen it all. And yet, they have never seen this level of violence and vitriol and racism, by the way. A ton of stories I could never say on air, from these so-called protesters. And the fact that as we talking about the effectiveness of local leaders, the fact that for example Mayor Durkin here only when protesters got to her house, through her gate.</p><p>Did she call it rioters' actions and incitement? But she let the CHOP zone destroy that city for weeks. And one of the officers made a great point to me. She said, you know, it came to her house, and so she stopped the protests then. But what about our house, that east precinct was my home, and I had to abandon it. And the fact that these guys have to question who supports them and why is heartbreaking to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's a good story, Emily. Coming up next, it's a midsummer shake-up, President Trump dropping his campaign manager, what that means for the 2020 campaign, straight ahead for you on THE FIVE.</p><p>PERINO: President Trump holding an event at the White House after shaking up his re-election campaign staff. Brad Parscale, he is out as campaign manager with polls showing that Vice President Biden is ahead of him in many of the polls. And taking over the big job is veteran GOP operative, Bill Stepien. Parscale will stay on as a senior adviser, meantime, the president attacking Joe Biden today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our entire economy and our very way of life are threatened by Biden's plans to transform our nation and subjugate our communities through the blunt force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven't even seen yet. You think that was bad? You haven't even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right. So that's at the White House just a few minutes ago. Jesse, the campaign needed a shot in the arm. Is this campaign personnel change going to help that problem?</p><p>WATTERS: I think it will. Let's remember, Donald Trump fired two campaign managers in 2016 in he still smoked Crooked Hillary. I don't know. I think Parscale did a great job building an online army. They're raising more money from small donors than Joe Biden. They have better situational awareness, the battleground states than Joe Biden does.</p><p>They had better data. And they are just more in touch with their base than Joe Biden is. So Brad's going to pass the torch to Bill and Bill is more of a national strategist, more of a national campaign manager. But let's be honest, President Trump is his own strategist and probably has got pretty good instincts. He's one and 0 when he's running for president.</p><p>Joe Biden, not that great, that's why Joe Biden has to rely more on his campaign manager, that campaign manager is going to making all the decisions for Joe. And let's remember, Joe Biden also got rid of his campaign manager just a few months ago. So that's not that big of a deal. If the president just stays focused on the economy, China, and getting this vaccine before November, I think he wins.</p><p>PERINO: Don't forget cancel culture because that is still a big issue. I do want to read you a little bit of a statement from Bill Stepien, so he is the new campaign manager. And he said something I thought was pretty interesting, Dan. He basically is saying that with 109 days left, our goal is clear. To win each day, we have left until Election Day.</p><p>If we win more days then Joe Biden wins, President Trump will be re- elected. And I want to talk to you about just how quickly this time could go between now and Election Day. Weeks go by very, very fast. And you have to try to win every single news cycle, every single day. And it's been a while since they could claim over a week's time.</p><p>So the other point is Bill Stepien has a record of winning races that are against the odds. Republicans Governor, Chris Christie was re-elected by 22-point state margin -- margin in a state as blue as New Jersey.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, a couple of things on this about winning the media cycle, that's tough. I mean, listen. The media overwhelmingly, 95 percent of it, no matter what Trump does it's going to paint him as anti-Trump story. It doesn't -- we've heard all the analogy (ph). We've heard all that. It's true. I mean, it's sadly true. They'd be on the side like a deadly disease if they can beat up Trump in a message.</p><p>It's pathetic. But having said that, you know, I think the palace intrigue angle for this is being overplayed, because some, again, not all, but some in the media want to play up the Trump team chaos. You know, we've heard it all before. I don't think this is a particularly big deal. Brad's not going anywhere. His expertise is digital. He does a fantastic job.</p><p>That's what he's doing. So putting that aside, I think the move more to where it's clearing up the message is a good one. You know, the president said it once in a press conference, Dana. It's one -- I don't get goose bumps anymore. I don't -- you know, I ran for office. I'm not particularly impressed by politicians.</p><p>But he gave a speech one. And he said it, you know, we will build it again, talking about the economy. And I got to tell you, I got goose bumps. Because I thought, yes, that's it, like, that's the message. We say that we, us, all of us, collectively saved ourselves from the dreadful Obama economy, this disaster that was handed to us. And we are all better off because of it before this plague hit us.</p><p>It was a great message. And if we can mail that, we will build that again, that optimistic message, I think he'll be in pretty good shape.</p><p>PERINO: And Emily, you've talked about small businesses before and the regulations and how it was hamstringing small businesses, the president doing a -- putting a focus on that today at the White House, saying that, you know, the deregulation push that they have done in the Trump administration is at risk if Biden were to win. Get your thoughts on that type of an economic message from the White House.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's exactly right, Dana. I also think it's specifically important for him to weigh in on COVID policies and regulations, that in this critical period of small businesses and all businesses to get back on their feet, it's important for leadership to set regulations that are business friendly. So going into 2016, for example, just regulations in general hamstring the average company all the time.</p><p>But now, it's even more crucial. So if he dovetails that message in with the -- as Dan pointed out, all of us getting back on our feet together, that's where the message will succeed.</p><p>PERINO: Juan, the Biden campaign's -- campaign director, Jen O'Malley Dillon, she put out a statement with some members that they have really upped their fundraising. They have a lot more cash on hand then they had before. Of course, she was additionally for more money. As I understand it, they sort of blew off the changes in the Trump campaign management structure. Is that something you've heard as well?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. Look, the reality is that this late, you know, about three months out basically to the election, you don't fire your campaign manager if things are going well. And what we saw yesterday in the polling was, you know, NBC had Biden up by 11. Quinnipiac had him up by 15. That's a pretty big margin, Dana. So I think people are, you know, finally, you know, up inside the campaign, acknowledging what we all had been seeing as a reality.</p><p>I feel bad, I got to tell you, for Brad Parscale. He is a nice guy. And I don't think that it's really about Brad Parscale. Jesse said this. I think this is about the candidates. It's about Donald Trump. And Trump is of running basically a rerun of 2016, division, name-calling, no vision, no answer, especially no answer in terms of Coronavirus.</p><p>And so he has bad numbers in terms of handling of the number one issue on the American mind. And I think that makes this election a referendum on him and he's not doing well.</p><p>PERINO: We'll see. We're actually going to talk about Coronavirus little bit next, because Dr. Anthony Fauci is reacting after being accused of being wrong about everything by a top White House advisor. We will talk about that next.</p><p>WATTERS: President Trump pushing back on reports of a feud with Dr. Anthony Fauci. It comes after White House trade advisor, Peter Navarro, went after the task force member in an op-ed titled, Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything. I have interacted with him on. Despite that, the president says he and Fauci have a good relationship.</p><p>But meanwhile, Fauci appearing on the digital cover of InStyle and saying he and Trump are on good terms, Fauci also defending his credibility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I believe for the most part you can trust respected medical authorities. You know, I believe I am one of them. So I think you can trust me. But I would stick with respected medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Dan, Fauci looks very comfortable with his legs crossed by the pool, very jealous of that kind of relaxation, but I'm here on THE FIVE. I will say this. Listen, he's not an evil guy. He's a very smart individual, but he has been wrong. He downplayed the virus in the beginning. He was wrong about the travel ban and the masks and Hydroxychloroquine. Is it not OK to criticize someone at all?</p><p>BONGINO: No, no. Of course -- listen, they're public figures. I mean, anyone in the public is going to be criticized. I don't take a job as a public figure. I'm not sure the InStyle magazine cover was necessarily, you know, the best idea. Maybe a journal of the American Medical Association cover would have been a little bit more suited to the times.</p><p>But here's -- there it is right there. But here's the problem I see. And it's not personal. I'm not here to pile on Dr. Fauci. He certainly has far more medical expertise than I do. But Jesse, this is a multi-factorial problem here. There are a number of factors. It's not just the virus. And I think you have the old hammer-nail analogy.</p><p>When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you're an epidemiologist and a virologist, everything is seen through the lens of a problem of the virus. And that's good. And I'm glad we have that expertise. In the triaging of our needs, that's at the top. But that is not only concern. We can't, you know, have people just spouting off in, you know, in the White House saying, you know what, a lockdown maybe a good idea.</p><p>You're going to crash the stock market. That has a real effect on people. It's not a joke. You can't just recommend a lockdown haphazardly and say, well, you know, we can shutdown the virus. Yes, well, you could also shutdown the hospital treating the virus. Did you think any of this through?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>BONGINO: Because you can't do elective procedures and they need to stay in business. What about our food supply that we strained (ph)? Did anyone think of that? That's a problem with placing too much faith in any one doctor or otherwise.</p><p>WATTERS: And Dana, obviously, presidents can listen to lots of advice from lots of people. They don't have to just tailor everything someone tells them and just follow everything willy-nilly. It's like, the president just doesn't listen to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and do everything they tell him to do. He gets a wide variety of opinions and then makes that decision.</p><p>PERINO: I think the attacks on Fauci have been one of the things that is just -- it is mind boggling. And I -- and here's the thing. Even Fauci himself said repeatedly, I'm just a guy that has one opinion, I am not the person who has to make the big decisions on all these different things. I'm just this guy.</p><p>This is somebody who has a credibility factor that is way far above what anybody else is having on this conversation, whether you like it or not. So then you have people like, oh, well, he was wrong on all of these things, and they keep repeating it, and then the President has to this week, constantly like backtrack, like oh, actually, no, I have a good relationship. No, actually, I'm going to call him. No, actually, Peter Navarro is wrong.</p><p>And it's -- if you are looking as a young person You want to understand how do you develop gravitas? Dr. Fauci is somebody you could look to because he is accomplished, he is credible, he's also having fun, and he's willing to push back and defend himself, but in a way that has protected his relationship with the president. That is skillful. And I think that we should all be grateful that this person is still willing to help all of us think these things through from his -- from his perspective.</p><p>And he again says he doesn't have all the answers. He's not the decision- maker. All he is, is informing the president. And I was glad the president called him yesterday because that -- keeping that relationship is really important for all of us in the future.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I mean, I definitely would agree that beefing with Fauci is not the greatest strategy right now. Juan Williams, I mean, Fauci came on \"WATTERS WORLD\" and he said, listen, I got things wrong. If I had to go back in time, I do things differently. But where's Birx? I love Deborah Birx. Where's she been, I wonder?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think she's a little more inside right now than even Dr. Fauci. Look, I mean, you know, the President had his social media people mocking Fauci, then you see the column criticizing Fauci, and guess what, you know what, Fauci is not allowed on T.V. very much anymore, that's why he's doing things like InStyle, right. I mean, he's much more online and you can pick up, and the T.V. stations pick that up.</p><p>But the point here is that the president, President Trump is the president. He's the decider. And if he wanted to fire Fauci, just get him out of here, he could do it. But he doesn't want to do that because Fauci is very popular with the American people. The American people do trust Dr. Fauci and think that he is credible and speaks directly to them with good information about this virus.</p><p>I mean, the big issue the last two days has been that the White House wanted all the hospitals to funnel information about the virus to them, through the Department of Health and Human Services, not to the CDC. They had to reverse that today and say no, no, we understand the criticism is so intense that we're going to politicize the data. It'll continue going to CDC.</p><p>But again, that's an illustration of how dangerous it is to play politics with the American people's health. We're worried about this virus.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I don't think they're playing politics with it. I just think it's a different way of doing business. OK, let's finish it up. What do you think?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I think that this isn't like a football game where we get excited about the competition, and we're all like, oh, oh. This is our livelihoods and our lives. So, I 100 percent support the president right now in getting that messaging out that yes, we are all on the same team.</p><p>And Dr. Fauci in that InStyle article. He said, it's pretty tough to try to get out your messaging and walk a tightrope, and everything you say is being pitted against the president. He said, it's very stressful. So I think ultimately we should all look at this, as Dana said, that we are all Americans, we're all learning as we go to an extent.</p><p>And you're right Jesse, we should always be able to criticize those in power. But when it's our health and our livelihoods that is at stake, I think it's most important for us to all be on the same team.</p><p>WATTERS: Agreed. And wear a mask. It can't hurt.</p><p>PERINO: And a tie.</p><p>WATTERS: Coming up, Twitter suffers a massive hack. A new report say it could have been an inside job. All the details ahead.</p><p>BONGINO: Hackers taking over several high-profile Twitter accounts in on of social media is most brazen cyberattacks yet. The FBI is now investigating after Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Apple, and many more posted bizarre messages that promoted a cryptocurrency scam. Reports indicate it was an inside job with hackers reportedly paying a Twitter employee who helped them gain access to the accounts. Experts say it could have been worse.</p><p>Emily, before I go to you, just a disclosure, I am one of the owners of a competitor to Twitter, Parler. So, I just want to put that out there. But are they in trouble here, Twitter? I mean, with your legal expertise, are they in some kind of legal trouble for this, you think?</p><p>PERINO: Sure.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They might be. There's always legal exposure. But I will say that this to me, is just an illustration that nothing is impenetrable. And this was a pretty minor example, frankly, but it just goes to show that yes, hacking can absolutely bring down planes and power grids and people and it is frightening.</p><p>And I think moving forward, it's important for people too to understand the death by drips that's happening just by using these devices, all of our data is being utilized and sold. And to me, there's no such thing as privacy or security. It's not a question of if it's just a question of when.</p><p>BONGINO: Juan, I mean, this was pretty serious. Can you imagine if they hacked into your account and said like, I'm voting Trump in 2020 or something like that? Can you imagine your audience would be like, what happened?</p><p>COMPAGNO: We'd know it was hacked.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes. Which is why the FBI is on the page.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, but I got to -- I got to say, I think this is serious. I know, we're laughing, but I think this is a really serious event that's worthy of FBI and Congressional investigation, because picking up on what Emily said about, you know, taking down airplanes or the grid, how about the stock market? How about an election?</p><p>You know, you could start a war. Getting the President's account, you could start a war for us and, you know, global catastrophe. So to me, this is the latest example of how social media, but big tech in general, is really begging for regulation, begging for someone to get involved and say, here are the rules of the road because right now greed and competence whatever, they seem to be running blind and they're running over us.</p><p>BONGINO: Well, I think the greediest people following government, that's what always worries me as Friedman always said. But Jesse, you know, Juan is not wrong. I mean, this was -- this one is serious. I mean, they could have posted to President Trump's account you know, some devastating national security message and cause the real situation.</p><p>WATTERS: Juan is not wrong, Dan?</p><p>BONGINO: Listen --</p><p>WATTERS: Even when he's right, you can't admit that. You never admit that. It's going to get him all cocky.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, yes.</p><p>WATTERS: No, I mean, in my opinion, this was the dumbest hack of all time. I mean, just to get some Bitcoin money? I mean, if you really wanted to make money, you say something that tanks stocks and then place a short bet and clean up. So I don't really get what was going on here. These guys obviously need to hire better I.T. people. Maybe not the guys from the DNC, but I'm sure there's some I.T. people that could make something impenetrable, as Emily said.</p><p>They should probably start worrying about banning hackers instead of conservatives. Their priorities are all sorts of messed up. When this thing happened, I thought to myself, you know, only the important people are being hacked. So, I almost wanted to tweet the exact same thing about Bitcoin just to make myself seem important, like I got hacked.</p><p>And then I thought maybe Fox might not like that, so I didn't do it. But at this point, I only look at Twitter twice a day. When I wake up in the morning to see the news, and then right at 6:00 to see if I've said anything offensive that's gone viral. Right now, Twitter is so tedious. I mean, it's like real housewives. Everyone's kind of jockeying for attention.</p><p>Your account is great Dan, or Dana, I love your account, Emily, everyone is accounts great on this show, but -- even Gutfeld.</p><p>BONGINO: Well, Dana, they locked out the blue checkmarks for a bit yesterday to clean up the problem. And America suffered Jasper withdrawals. There were no Jasper pictures for two hours. It's unthinkable.</p><p>WATTERS: You got to go to Instagram.</p><p>PERINO: That's right. I made up for it this morning because those pictures were just impossible not to put up there. And the thing about Juan is that even when he's right, he's still Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: Here's one of my concerns. I -- well, first of all, the company is saying that they're -- that it wasn't somebody from the inside that gave access. We'll see. I think the investigation will turn up what it turns out fine. What I'm concerned about is that whoever it was, that this was a dry run for something much more serious. And so that's why I think the FBI has to be involved immediately. This is a public safety issue at this point.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, that's interesting, fascinating. Coming up next, CNN attacks President Trump -- there we go -- after his latest defense of Goya. Stay tuned.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Liberal calls for a boycott of soy foods prompting President Trump and his daughter Ivanka to post on social media supporting the company. It has CNN very upset. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: You tell me how a president in the middle of a pandemic has got time for this (BLEEP). Are you kidding me? Hawking products, Goya, I don't care who it is. Resolute desk, this is what he's resolute about.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN: We're in a public health battle for our lives and our futures and the President is sitting there behind the Resolute Desk, resolutely clutching at beans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dan Bongino, why is it so impossible for the mainstream media to focus on the real issue?</p><p>BONGINO: Well, I mean, their mainstream media, they're just embarrassing buffoons. I mean, look at those two. I mean, Chris Cuomo, I'm super surprised he's not doing triceps curls at his desk. But these liberal boycotts are always an embarrassing failure. Remember the Chick-Fil-A boycott? You couldn't get a chicken sandwich for 47 square miles in my neighborhood after the alleged boycott. You can't find a black bean can anywhere in my local neighborhood after their so-called boycott.</p><p>But there's a reason, and the reason is the liberals who allegedly boycott these -- you know, sit in their basements and have no jobs and watch Teletubby videos all day, unemployed, roasting smores. So they have no buying power, while conservatives who have jobs will go out and support people who stand up for the United States. So these boycotts are always a hilarious busts and they're kind of fun to watch these idiots implode.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, what are the larger consequences here?</p><p>PERINO: Well, it depends. I mean, it is possible, as Dan says that the Goya could become the new Chick-Fil-A and so cows everywhere will continue to be happy. But I do think that there's a possibility here that after the election, after this is no longer useful to anybody politically, that there are long term possible consequences for the company that has 4,000 employees, so there's that.</p><p>And then the other thing is I do think that this is a company that has done incredible charitable work for Latinos especially in the time of the pandemic, making sure that they were out there providing food, whatever else was needed in the Latino community like very, very much focused on that.</p><p>And when the liberals and these other liberal groups try to go after this company for expressing, you know, a First Amendment right with the president and being grateful for having been there, then I do think you have to look back and say, what have you done for the Latino community? How many -- how many Latinos are on your board? Because it's 100 percent Latinos on the Goya board.</p><p>So I think that if people try to make political hay out of it, they have to understand that there could be long term consequences. But those on the left trying to hurt Goya, they're actually just biting off their nose to spite their face.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Juan, I had the pleasure of interviewing the Goya of food CEO on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" and he shared with me that when Michelle Obama, then-First Lady, invited him to the White House to work with her, he accepted, and also he accepted the Trump administration's invitation to attend the White House. Why is respecting the office of the presidency such a deal-breaker for Democrats?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't think it's just Democrats. I think it's specifically Latinos and maybe most of all Mexican Americans who feel that the President has attacked immigrants from Mexico, you know, demean them, mock them, call them names. I think there's the reason.</p><p>But look, in this instance, you know, why is it that owning the libs and culture wars is more important than anything to the president? Why is it more important than dealing with the pandemic? I just don't get it. I think that putting those cans there, holding a can of beans like he's the king of the world, I mean, it seems to me misplaced priorities in the in this current pandemic.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Jesse, what are your thoughts?</p><p>WATTERS: Trump is defending Mexican food. Really, CNN has said about that? I thought CNN said he hates Mexicans, and now they're upset because he's defending Mexican food. Which one is it CNN? I mean -- and liberals are the ones boycotting Mexican food. It's like everything's up and you can't make sense of it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's true. All right, guys, stay with us, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: It's time for Jesse's fish tales. I caught something. All right, so there's this crazy fish out of Malaysia. Look at this sucker. This guy is called a trigger fish. And check out chompers. These guys usually (AUDIO GAP) it's very aggressive. of the males (AUDIO GAP). I don't know about you guys, but I am definitely triggered by this fish.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow, that was interesting. Dana?</p><p>PERINO: Look like he had a good dentist too. I'm going to talk to you about a little baby and a big dog. Check out Nicholas. He's one years old, and he has a family dog named Odin, 140-pound Newfoundland. And Nicholas' parents say that Odin thinks that this little guy is his baby. So he protects him and always make sure he's OK. And in fact, Nicholas, his first words were wolf, wolf, which is something I think -- I think Greg's first words were wolf, wolf, right before animals are great.</p><p>Also, new podcasts, I'll Tell You What, with Chris Stirewalt. We talked about all sorts of things like when I was -- when we had the podcast, I was having an -- I was over-caffeinated so don't listen at 1.5 speed. That's all I got to say.</p><p>BONGINO: I got that problem often.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Nice.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow, you're going fast. OK, you've heard of searching for pirate's treasure. Well, how about searching for a treasure hidden by a Michigan jeweler? Yes, take a look. That's Johnny Perry, a jeweler in Washington Township, Michigan. Mr. Perry buried $1 million, I repeat, $1 million worth of precious metal and gyms in the state. He hid it in waterfalls, streams, and even in the woods, and he put a GPS device on every treasure to keep track of it.</p><p>The first hunt begins August 1st, then people will be looking for two 100- ounce silver bars. The worth $40,200. Jesse, Dana, Dan, Emily, are you coming with me?</p><p>WATTERS: I'm right behind you, Juan.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, that sounds awesome.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: I'm right behind.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, Dan, you're up.</p><p>BONGINO: All right, so this Vancouver couple, they took the plunge into marriage and into the lake too. So Laura and Jordan decided they were going to take a photo doing a little dance move. And you see that, little dip on the dock. Yes, yes, it did not -- we all know where this is going. It's very dramatic picture, so dramatic they actually fell in the water.</p><p>Listen they all had good spirits about it. They emerged from the water, went back to the party, everybody is wondering why you all wet. Well, we fell in the water, brushed off some makeup, got right back to business. Good for them, classic photo, now you're all famous on THE FIVE, so good for you and good luck.</p><p>WATTERS: Best of luck.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Emily, you're up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right, guys, Remember the best show of all time The Golden Girls?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh your house is just breathtaking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said it looks like a dump from the outside.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right, so you guys, that house is for sale. And even though the shows are placed in Miami, the house itself is in Brentwood in L.A. We can all pull our money and buy it for about $3 million. Juan, I will go on the treasure hunt with you if you go on this house with me. What do you say?</p><p>WATTERS: Wow, yes, that's a beautiful house.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, August 20th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are watching retail this morning. Kohl's is set to report momentarily. We'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit. We're expecting $1.53 on revenue of $4.2 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes on top of Home Depot reported last hour. Home Department cut its full year sales guidance. It is citing lower lumber prices and potential tariffs -- potential tariffs. But saying that the current health of the U.S. consumer is strong and the stable housing environment continues to support the business at Home Depot. Shares are up now 1.25 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher. Take a look at futures looking to extend the rally of yesterday, although the Dow Industrials just turned negative. Dow futures now down 5 points. S&amp;P futures are unchanged right now. And the Nasdaq futures are up 2.75 points. There seems to be some selling coming on right here as we speak.</p><p>This after stocks kicked off the week with a big rally yesterday. Take a look. DowIndustrials were up 249 points. The S&amp;P was up 35. And the Nasdaq was up 106, one and a third percent.</p><p>Kohl's numbers are coming out and they look like a beat on the earnings line. We want to look at global markets this morning and check Kohl's. Let's get to Ashley Webster right now with the breaking news on Kohl's -- Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hello -- Maria.</p><p>Let's get earnings per share coming in on an adjusted basis of $1.55, beating the estimate by two cents. Revenue also beating, coming in at $4.43 billion. The estimate was for $4.2 billion. Although comp sales -- comparable sales are down 2.9 percent although the outlook which was for guidance of $5.15 to $5.45 on EPS, they are maintaining that guidance.</p><p>So no change to the outlook for the rest of the year. A beat on the top and the bottom, although as we just said, the comparable sales down 2.9 percent. And those are the headlines we have so far -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Stock is down 2.5 percent right now - -Ashley. We'll be watching that.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to look at this retail sector because obviously consumer spending is two-thirds of the economy.</p><p>Our top story this morning though, the Israel controversy. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib condemning Israel's travel restrictions yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D), MINNESOTA: The decision to ban me and my colleagues - - my colleague -- the first two Muslim American women elected to Congress, is nothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to suppress our ability to do our jobs as elected officials. Denying visits to duly- elected members of Congress is not consistent with being an ally.</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN: It is unfortunate that Prime Minister Netanyahu has apparently taken a page out of Trump's book and even this direction from Trump to deny this opportunity.</p><p>OMAR: We are going to fight this administration and the oppressive Netanyahu administration until we take our last breath.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Their comments following the White House's response to reports that Democrats may retaliate against Israel with legislative action against top American and Israeli diplomats.</p><p>The White House says this. \"Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar have a well-documented history of anti-Semitic comments, anti-Semitic social media posts and anti-Semitic relationships. Israel has the right to prevent people who want to destroy it from entering the country. And Democrats' pointless congressional inquiries here in America cannot change the laws Israel has passed to protect itself.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Tennessee Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member David Kustoff. Congressman -- good to see you. Thanks very much for being here this morning.</p><p>REP. DAVID KUSTOFF (R), TENNESSEE: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you are one of only two Jewish Republicans in the House of Representatives. What's your reaction to all of this?</p><p>KUSTOFF: you know, my reaction is -- first of all, as we know, Israel passed a law within the last couple of years to ban people from traveling to Israel who may do harm to the country. But even going back, you know, within the past two weeks we saw Republican and Democrat freshmen members of Congress go on a -- they go every other year to Israel with their leaders, Steny Hoyer and Kevin McCarthy. It's a tradition.</p><p>Those two members could have gone with their freshmen class -- their freshmen members, both Republican and Democrat, to learn more about Israel, to learn more about the Palestinian Authority and how we interact in the world. They chose on their own not to go on that trip. And I think they wanted this trip obviously that they wanted to take to make a statement to further promote BDS, which we as a nation oppose.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, BDS is obviously Boycott Israel. And you think that was a complete, direct, you know, intentional decision not to go on the trip with Kevin McCarthy and Steny Hoyer and instead just try to make a lot of noise around their own trip.</p><p>KUSTOFF: Well, it was to make -- it was to make a statement. Because again, it's a tradition that all the freshmen Republicans and Democrats travel together to Israel. They could have gone on this trip. They chose not to go on the trip.</p><p>It was just within the last week to two weeks. They wanted to make their own statement and I think that would have been certainly against Israel's interest. Israel deemed it a possible threat to their security --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUSTOFF: -- for them to go. And of course as we know Congressman Tlaib was granted later a day or two after the denial the right to go and visit her grandmother --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUSTOFF: -- on humanitarian needs and she decided not to do that, again, to make a further statement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So where is this going then?</p><p>KUSTOFF: You know, I think that the Democrats really have a challenge. We've seen this since the beginning of the year, since Democrats took control of the house, that those two members along with some others have promoted the BDS mantra, anti-Semitic remarks. And time after time unfortunately we've not seen the Democrat leadership take a stand and push back against this type of anti-Semitic rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we haven't.</p><p>KUSTOFF: When we go back -- when we go back in September, I think we may see a further escalation of this type of talk. And at some point I think the Democratic leadership is either going to have to take a stand -- they're going to have to take a stand one way or the other.</p><p>And of course you mentioned that I'm one of two Jewish Republicans in the House of Representatives. There are more than 20 Democratic Jewish representatives in the House. I know that a number of them would like for their leadership, their Democratic leadership to stand up and take a stand. I think they have to at some point, as long as this anti-Semitic talk and the BDS talk continues to escalate in the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes -- which is why I would have expected more of a commentary from your colleagues on the left because of -- because of their heritage.</p><p>But when you go back in September, there's also going to be talk of impeachment again. Jerry Nadler wants this. Congressman Ben Ray Lujan becoming the latest Democrat backing impeachment claims. He's now the highest ranking House Democrat to support an investigation. Tell me where you think this goes.</p><p>KUSTOFF: Yes. You know, It's a tremendous distraction. Frankly, Maria, it's a time suck. It really is.</p><p>I've read the 448-page Mueller report. I really wonder how many members of Congress have read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUSTOFF: We know Mueller's conclusions. We know that unfortunately the Democrats have continued to want to try to gin this up. You think back a couple months ago, they thought by having John Dean come and testify before the committee that that would spur interest among the American people.</p><p>Well now, the majority of the American people oppose impeachment. That hearing was a dud. Then they followed up with having Mueller come to testify who stated publicly that he didn't want to testify --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUSTOFF: -- he thought the report spoke for itself. They had him testify as we know a few weeks ago for two different house committees. That didn't move the needle.</p><p>You know, from a policy standpoint, as long as the Democrats continue to want to focus on impeachment and push impeachment, it means that all these issues that we need to deal with as a Congress get pushed to the side because right now in Washington in Congress, we don't do a good job of walking and chewing gum at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that was my next question.</p><p>KUSTOFF: If they want --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean you've got a fight over Israel. You've got a fight over impeachment. What can you get done when you get back?</p><p>KUSTOFF: Well, and you've got the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, that we need to -- we really need to ratify that before the end of the year. We've got appropriations.</p><p>So to go back to your point, Maria, there are only so many hours in a day. There are only so many days left of the year --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KUSTOFF: -- I think we've got around 40 legislative days left. The Democrats can choose impeachment or they can choose to do the work of the people. I would rather -- I would get done what the people have elected me to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>KUSTOFF: But the fact of the matter is that if they pursue impeachment, it's going to fail. I don't know that they've got -- certainly among Republicans, there's not the support among Republicans. And we know that the Senate would not convict.</p><p>So what is the purpose? I think that probably there's some Democrat leaders that politically they understand that because they know the lessons --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Like Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>KUSTOFF: -- from the Bill Clinton impeachment in 1998. That's exactly right. But the question is, how much longer can the Democrat leadership hold off some of these insurgents that are calling for impeachment. I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Tom Bevan.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, FOUNDER, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Congressman -- just quickly, what are the odds that USMCA is going to get passed?</p><p>And then also there's talk that Democrats are lining up a bunch of gun control bills for the House of Representatives. Any chance that anything will move on gun control?</p><p>KUSTOFF: You know, on USMCA, the overwhelming majority of Republicans, just about all Republicans want to see that passed. I think that there are a fair number of Democrats that want to see the USMCA passed.</p><p>But think about the climate that we're in right now. I mean we need to get it done. We certainly need to get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how do you get it done -- Congressman? Do you have to make any more tweaks in terms of salaries? Would you have to make changes to this? Because when I have people like Debbie Dingell on, you know, Michigan. She says look, we need changes in terms of salaries because Mexican workers make $1.50 an hour and we don't want U.S. workers to get into that problem.</p><p>KUSTOFF: Yes. Well, I do think that the President has done a really good job negotiating those concessions with Mexico and Canada. Could there be some more tweaks? I'm sure that Speaker Pelosi is going to demand it.</p><p>But remember in the house, to get the vote on the floor, Speaker Pelosi has to put this bill on the floor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KUSTOFF: We're running out of days. And to go back to the climate for just a moment, I'm convinced that there are some Democrats that don't want to vote for it because they see it as being a win for President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. We know that.</p><p>KUSTOFF: It's a win for the American people. It's a win for the American employees. It's a win for the American manufacturers.</p><p>And Tom, I think you asked about gun control. You know, there's a lot of talk, there's a lot of cross-talk. So far, I have not seen any bills or any legislation in toto that are being proposed and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the red flag bill?</p><p>KUSTOFF: You know, one question I have is will the administration be in support of it? But among our conference, among our Republican congressmen, I don't think there's the support right now for red flag laws.</p><p>We ought to continue the fix mix bill (ph) that we passed last year in terms of trying to improve the background system check.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Background checks are important. Sir -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>KUSTOFF: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman David Kustoff joining us. Coming up, battling big tech, several states ready to fight potential monopolies. Their strategy coming up.</p><p>Then Apple's streaming debut, everything you need to know about the new service later this hour. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The NYPD officer fired five years after putting Eric Garner in a banned choke hold is now fighting to get his job back. Cheryl Casone with details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well Maria -- emotions running high here in New York yesterday and now Daniel Pantaleo he is preparing to sue the police department. He was terminated without a pension just yesterday.</p><p>Pantaleo was accused of using reckless force the day that Eric Garner died out in New York City's sidewalk back in 2014. NYPD The police commissioner James O'Neil, said that even though the death was unintentional, there had to be consequences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES O'NEIL, NEW YORK POLIC COMMISSIONER: The unintended consequence of Eric Garner's death must have a consequence of its own. Therefore, I agree with the deputy Commissioner of Child (ph) legal findings and recommendations. it is clear that Daniel Pantaleo can no longer effectively serve as a New York city police officer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Garner's death has sparked nationwide protests over the use of protests over the use of force toward unarmed black men by law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Well, a major deal to tell you about in the animal health industry. It is a growing industry. Alonco animal health will is going to purchase Bayer's veterinary drugs business, for $7.6 billion. This is a cash and stock deal to recreate the second largest animal health company by global revenue. It's expected to close in mid 2020 of course. It is subject to regulatory approval.</p><p>There is, by the way, those Fred creating the second largest animal health company by global revenue. It is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to regulatory a approval. There is, by the way, those stocks in the premarket. And then it's officials. starting today, no plastic water bottles can be sold at San Francisco International. The goal is to cut down on waste and pollution but the ban does not affect bottled soda, juice or flavored water. Ok.</p><p>San Francisco international believed to be the first U.S. airport, Maria, to ban single use water bottles. It's an interesting choice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess they'll be glass.</p><p>CASONE: They're going to have start something different.</p><p>So but, you can still get eel diet coke in a plastic bottle so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Tackling Big Technology, states are ready to fight potential monopolies. We've got the fallout coming up.</p><p>Then we all scream for ice cream, right. The company that's been making ice cream in the U.S. for over 150 years is here in studio, they're bringing some treats. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The crackdown on big tech continues. Many states are now gearing up for an anti-trust investigation against some of the largest companies in tech.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton is here now with more details there. Good morning -- Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So Maria -- good morning. For investors who own the stocks, we're assuming it's Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple. Listen it might be a little bit of a choppy ride.</p><p>So our colleagues at the \"Wall Street Journal are saying a group of states attorneys general, the number is unconfirmed, some sources say could be up to 20, could be bipartisan, are going to move forward with a joint anti- trust investigation.</p><p>So this would be pretty big. I mean we know the Justice Department, the FTC earlier this year have already reached detailed arrangements at least for Google and Facebook, also Amazon and Apple. But this just adds another layer of scrutiny for these companies.</p><p>Interestingly enough, separately, the FTC chairman says that Facebook's plan to merge Instagram and WhatsApp into Facebook may actually make it harder to break up, which presumably is why Mark Zuckerberg did exactly that, even at the cost of all the bad publicity and the fact that the Instagram and WhatsApp founders have fled and a lot in the tech community said this has proved that, you know, you cannot have these sort of successful, integrated acquisitions. So basically if you're long in these stocks, it's just something to be aware of.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it partly to keep pressure on these companies, because they're worried that there's also censorship going on going into the election.</p><p>BOLTON: I think censorship is a big thing but the main complaint that seems to have the most bipartisan support is actually these accusations that's these companies are squashing competition.</p><p>And so this next level up of potential Amazon, Google, Facebook -- that they're not able to get off the ground.</p><p>We've had a Professor Scott Galloway on. He teaches . He teaches at NYU and he has actually outright said these four companies should be broken up. He's also been very transparent. He made a ton of. He made a ton of money as an investor in all of them.</p><p>But he says it's unfair to the ecosystem. And I think there's a lot of people who believe that that's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. you've got a company like Google, Omeed, that has 90 percent market share. 90 percent market share in search.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: 90 percent of people use it when they search. But they also buy up companies that are innovating. So my business works with pre IPO companies as you know. And so when they're about to go public or even before that, they get acquired by these big companies.</p><p>And it's very diverse set of companies as well. I use nest which takes video when you're not home, It's owned by Google. So you think about what they know what you're searching for. They even have all the recordings of when you're home and when you're not home. These companies -- fines aren't going to do it. I think we need to actually break them up.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Because Facebook already paid $5 billion. And let's face it, for Facebook, they can pay that. I mean and we shouldn't be so surprised because sports teams do this all the time. Sometimes you extend a player's contract just to keep him on your bench so that he's not playing for the opposing team so tech is no different.</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Fines aren't going to do it but it's not standard oil either. Like at the end of the day, they just stop them from acquiring the competitors. If Instagram wasn't bought by Facebook. If YouTube wasn't bought by Google. They would have a competitive, there would be two social media companies now. And because it's such a dynamic industry unlike Standard Oil or AT&amp;T they're going to have competitors if they're allowed to and they don't keep acquiring them.</p><p>So I think that's the first step, other than I think a breakup would be heavy-handed. It wouldn't achieve the goals. I don't think it addresses the issues of -- there's these little mini-monopolies medicine my monopolies that are created. And I think I assume that's what regulators are going to look at like -- you know, the app store. Like why do they get a cut like it's basically a monopoly and they're going to just take a peach of everybody's content forever. And they just decree .</p><p>BOLTON: 1999, you had Microsoft and essentially the E.U. succeeded in labeling the company as a monopoly. They broke it up. I mean states here looking at it. And to your point, Jonathan maybe Microsoft had to agree to a new set of playing rules, right.</p><p>FERRIS: The common difference is like Microsoft made mistakes when the consumer was getting the pinch and that's why the regulators jumped on them so bad. Because it's like at the end of the day, like what's driving up the price of like, you know, the computer, it's still like that. But the software is expensive and they still deal with the office monopoly.</p><p>The tech companies got this way because they were so smart about leaving -- giving the consumer freebies. And the regulators look after the consumers. They didn't notice they were squeezing businesses. You know, like go You go to google to search, your company name you have you to pay for it to be in the search or your competitors are going to buy. It's basically extortion.</p><p>And that's who is footing the bill of the ad growth, it's other businesses. The government doesn't care about businesses being shaken up as much as consumers and the consumers got a good deal and told --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BEVAN: But that's note.</p><p>But that shows that the regulatory regime needs to change. It's an antiquated.</p><p>To look at it based on cost, that's not the appropriate --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BEVAN: So, the question also is, in it's fine to say they need to let other companies have competition but the question is have we passed that point. When Google has 90 percent, they 've already bought up all these companies, you know, changing the regulation -- maybe they need to be broken up.</p><p>FERRIS: Yes, they already have it, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Precisely. They already have it.</p><p>Does this slight regulation, that could seriously affect the profit margins and growth. Or you're just like one little thing like, you know You know what. You know what -- the only you can only show one ad at the search That one simple rule, you can't just have pages of ads because you have 90 percent of the search market, no one is going to go to another search provider unless it comes on the --</p><p>BOLTON: Other probes -- Google has basically said look, we give you as (INAUDIBLE). What do you want?</p><p>I mean that's their Defense is that they are offering a product at a very low cost, And obviously not referencing that they have 90 percent.</p><p>FERRIS: But there's a cross. It's not monetary there.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an issue that both sides of the aisle want happening. Ted Cruz and Elizabeth Warren both want these companies broken up.</p><p>Great reporting as always. Thank you so much -- Deirdre.</p><p>Coming up. Retail earnings in focus this morning, what the latest numbers mean for the economy. We know that Home Depot lowered its sales guidance for the year.</p><p>The Trump administration now apparently according to the \"Washington Post\" considering another tax cut. The White House says it's not true.</p><p>Then crying foul, social media clucking over which fast food chains make the best sandwich. The heated argument coming up.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, August 20th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Retail is in focus this morning, Dow component Home Depot out earlier this morning, cutting its sales guidance to account for lower lumber prices and the potential tariffs impact. But the company also said that the current health of the U.S. consumer and stable housing continues to support the business. The stock is moving higher this morning, take a look. It is now up 1-1/2 percent. It was back and forth when the numbers first came out.</p><p>Kohl's is also just out, it had a double beat, up on earnings and revenue. The stock is surging, up better than five percent. We're going to take a look inside Kohl's quarter why it's done so well.</p><p>Later this morning, we will hear from discount retailer TJX. Markets this morning have been mixed. It's been an up and down morning. And we are now solidly negative. The Dow Futures are down 17 points, S&amp;P Futures down two points and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 6-1/4.</p><p>This after the market kicked off the week pretty strongly. The DowIndustrials were up 250 points yesterday, almost one percent. The S&amp;P was up 35 points and the NASDAQ was up 106, that was 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices for example are mixed. They are off of the highs of the morning. The FT-100 up 29 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up just one point, the DAX Index in Germany has now turned negative. It is down 13 points, fractional move there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed story there as well. Take a look, as you see, the Chinese Shanghai composite was down a fraction, as was the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index. This morning, China is looking to boost its economy once again with new stimulus. It is setting its new loan prime rate at 4-1/4 percent that is lower than the existing benchmark rate of one year lending rate.</p><p>Support for the U.S. economy meanwhile, the White House is pushing back against a report from the Washington Post of a payroll tax cut in the works. This as President Trump pushes the Fed for a bigger rate cut, the president asking for a 100 basis point cut, 100 basis points from the Fed. He is once again criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for what he calls, quote, a horrendous lack of vision.</p><p>Streaming wars, Apple spending big on original programming for its streaming service.

Find out its recipe for success when they are here this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, this retail earnings. Kohl's premarket rising after its earnings and sales beat, Home Depot warning that rising material costs as well as tariffs could weigh on growth later on in the year. Both stocks nonetheless are higher, Kohl's up almost six percent right now, Home Depot up 1-3/4 percent. Broader market is searching for some direction turning lower earlier this hour as you can see.</p><p>Joining us right now is Federated Investors senior equity strategist Linda Duessel. And Linda, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Oh, Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what's your take on the broad outlook? We've got the retail numbers out this morning and there's all this talk about a recession. Where do you stand?</p><p>DUESSEL: We don't see a recession on the horizon at all. Truly, earnings are slowing that's -- I think that's the worst thing that you could say is that earnings growth is slowing. Because just as you mentioned, Home Depot is suggesting there there's going to be some trouble on the way out this year and their stock is up.</p><p>So all -- many of the worries about tariffs are already in the market and the retail sales are spectacular because we're a consumer-led economy and we're working.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then what do you make of the rock bottom interest rates, the inverted yield curve, the fact that you're talking about negative rates throughout Europe and of course the Federal Reserve on this campaign to lower interest rates.</p><p>DUESSEL: I think that the interest rate question and particularly around the globe is under-appreciated and under -- and under -- and not understood very well at all. We're in a new time now, an unprecedented time, $16 trillion and counting in terms of negative yields around the globe. I find it's very, very curious that we're talking so much about our own inverted yield curve here in the United States when it's a global problem and it is -- I've heard words like alarming but then nothing after that. You know, what -- where does this all lead?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right and --</p><p>DUESSEL: And nobody really knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, the 10 year at 1.56 percent is pretty extraordinary. Omeed, your company focuses on private company.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Private equity. You're buying companies before they go in public.</p><p>MALIK: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see the same kind of vibrancy in that sector that we're seeing elsewhere?</p><p>MALIK: Actually I see even more. So it's one of the reasons we started our business. We think the private sector is having a lot more innovation than public stocks. IPOs are down 85 percent since their high in 1999 and 2000. The last time we had a boom in tech. In addition the number of companies that are traded publicly has reduced dramatically as well. So we're seeing a lot of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MALIK: -- liquidity actually in private companies. Companies want to stay private a lot longer and not go into the public markets because there's so much liquidity that comes in from around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Such an important point that you make, that the number of public companies has shrunk so much. Why? Is it regulation?</p><p>MALIK: Well, partly, you have regulation, in addition you have the JOBS Act in 2012 that allowed you to have quadruple the amount of private investors than you could before. So that's something you keep on talking about enough. But now you can have 2,000 private shareholders, before you could only have 500.</p><p>The other point I'd make is liquidity. There are a lot of other sources of money now that don't just occur in the U.S. public markets. So things are changing dramatically on the private side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really interesting stuff. Linda, does that tell you anything in terms of how investors are doing today? What's the investment call in an environment where we've got rates where they are and so much talk about an economy slowing and perhaps recession on the horizon?</p><p>DUESSEL: Yes. Well, in conjunction with our comments about the negative - - the inverted yield curve and negative yields around the world, but a very strong U.S. consumer, I think we're in a binary situation now.</p><p>The United States still remains the best place to invest in the world. We continue to grow and we as I said earlier, we don't see a recession at all on the horizon. So it makes it -- it makes the U.S. stock market a great place to invest. It doesn't seem that expensive to us.</p><p>And then of course, as we've all been talking about, the very many events that are coming in the next eight to 12 months, that will be binary in nature. They're either going to be great news or bad news for the markets. So we need to put some ballast in our portfolios.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the events that you're referring to -- what events are you referring to?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, you know, we're referring to geopolitical events around the world, Brexit is very, very big one. And I think Brexit very, very interesting because they keep pushing off a deadline and we worry very much. It's the fifth largest economy in the world. And yet I read very recently that wages are going up nicely over there, employment is still very good in the United Kingdom. It's just the consumers around the world are doing very, very well. Of course our own election will be very, very interesting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.</p><p>DUESSEL: -- regardless of who wins. I think there's potential trouble in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, CO FOUNDER, MAXFUNDS.COM: Linda, Jonas Ferris of MaxFunds. We talk about this global mysterious factors and central banks, inverted yield curves and negative but like, just like domestically like you guys run, if I'm not mistaken, equity funds, money market funds and bond funds. I imagine like other open and fund companies you're seeing outflows out of the equity funds and into the bond funds and money market funds. To what extent is that behavior, the hundreds of billions by retail U.S. investors into bond funds driving these prices of bonds down or the yields down?</p><p>DUESSEL: Yes, and Jonas, it's very, very interesting that pretty much throughout the whole bull run since even 2009 we've seen across the entire industry moneys leaving equities and going into bonds.</p><p>Of course, one of the great demands, one of the great reasons why yields are so low is that demand is so high and here in the United States at least we have a positive yield curve for global investors. Over-arching all of this is the fact that you have many, many aging baby boomers who need some income and who are very, very worried after the crisis so they go to government bonds.</p><p>The one good thing we can say for that about stocks is that helps them not be over-bought. There is no euphoria and value is still there, as long as we're growing. So we do like -- we do like stocks very, very much and we're seeing good in-flows in to some of our growthy areas.</p><p>MALIK: I talk -- hi, this is Omeed. I talked about the increase in liquidity in the private markets. Do you feel like in a post crisis equity market though there's a lack of liquidity, particularly I'm thinking of the Volcker Rule and how that took banks out of the market.</p><p>And so, in months like August when you have new shocks, are we just going to have more volatility with that lack of liquidity, both seasonally and in a post crisis market?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, yes of course and as a -- as your other guest suggested, private equity is growing very, very dramatically. There are less and less stocks for us to trade and invest in, when you have now the proliferation of ETFs and the SPY in particular which is the most commonly used of all trading in about 2,000 percent they annualized turnover, you can see moneys flow in very, very quickly or out very, very quickly.</p><p>Add on to that, the machine trading that's going on, we need to remember volatility is going to be probably bigger but doesn't change the fundamentals. We just need a strong tummy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you know, with all of this flight to quality to bonds and to the U.S., really because of what's going on the rest of the world, it's strengthening dollar and you wonder if that's going to undercut earnings later on in the year, pretty good story in the Journal yesterday about this. Are you worried about the dollar strength cutting into earnings?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, of course that's been a big worry now for a number of years. It's -- we've been king dollar for some time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUESSEL: That is definitely something that's going to weigh on earnings growth. And we'll be talking about that a lot as make our way through the back half of this year --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why --</p><p>DUESSEL: -- lower and lower earnings growth does not mean a recession, however.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so but this is one reason that, you know, there's this speculation that we're going to see fiscal stimulus, you know. Tom, the Whites House is pushing back against reports on a payroll tax cut in the works effuse of a recession. The Washington Post reports it, what's your take on further fiscal stimulus from this administration?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, they're not going to be able to get anything through Congress as I mentioned earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BEVAN: That's just not going to happen. And so, that's why you're seeing Trump pounding on Jay Powell, asking for this rate cut because he wants to see -- he actually wants to see the consumer spending continue, because consumer's driving -- is driving our economy and will drive him to re- election if it stays strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Linda, the president wants a one basis point -- one full point cut in interest rates from the Fed. What's your reaction to what's going on there with the Fed and the White House?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, history shows that any good president who's running for re- election will job own the Fed to try to reduce interest rates on his way into the next election year. So it's in the markets that they'll probably cut twice more, maybe for another 50 basis points this year, so probably the president would want to pick a higher number than that as he goes out there and talks about it.</p><p>And I just would like to say that the United States is in great shape. My biggest concern is recession in China and then that passing through the rest of the world, particularly the Eurozone and Germany and they're the ones that really need to do the fiscal stimulus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, great comments, Linda. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>DUESSEL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Linda Duessel joining us from Federated.</p><p>Coming up, Apple streaming debut, everything you need to know about the new service, how much it is, that's next.</p><p>And then the chicken fight, the internet argument over which restaurant has the best chicken sandwich, the poultry war, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The U.S. is issuing a warning to Greece over helping an Iranian tanker. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We've been following the tanker's movements, Maria. And now the U.S. State Department has made its position very clear. They say any efforts by Greece to assist that tanker would be seen as providing material support to Syria which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.</p><p>The Iranian tanker is due to arrive in Greece on Sunday after it was released by Gibraltar over the weekend. The Greece says the vessel has not asked to dock at one of its ports. But again, that was an Iranian vessel.</p><p>Apple is ready to take a bite out of the streaming wars. The company reportedly going to be launching its Apple T.V. Plus service by November. It's going to be $10.00 a month, similar to Hulu or Netflix. It was originally announced back in March as a direct competitor to those streaming services including Disney's upcoming streaming service, we should add.</p><p>Financial Times reporting that Apple's budget for T.V. Plus has ballooned to more than $6 billion. There's Apple in the premarket.</p><p>And then there is this, the chicken wars are heating up. I kid you not. Feathers are flying on Twitter one week after Popeyes released its chicken sandwich nationwide. Well, Chick-fil-A tweeted, quote, bun plus chicken plus pickles, equals all the love for the original, end quote. Popeyes responded with a snide, you all good, OK. Then Wendy's decided they were going to jump in at this whole thing. You all out here fighting about which of these fools has the second best chicken sandwich. Not to be (INAUDIBLE) I'm trying to keep up.</p><p>Then Popeye's jumped in and they said, sounds like someone just ate one of our biscuits because you all looking thirsty. I just want to you alls in this.</p><p>We'll see who wins, Maria, the poultry war. I guess fried chicken and southerners just kind of go hand in hand. My grandmother made great fried chicken, so maybe that's true. There you are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great.</p><p>CASONE: Chicken war.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, best chicken sandwich. Do you have a fave?</p><p>CASONE: Chick-fil-A, memory serves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think that's yours too.</p><p>BEVAN: Chick-fil-A's on top, sure.</p><p>FERRIS: Aren't cardiologists winning this war?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, there you go, cardiologist.</p><p>All right, quick break, thank you, Cheryl. We are at the height of the ice cream season meanwhile. My next guest company celebrates the summer treat with flavors made right here in the USA. We're taking a look and a taste, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Made in America, one of the oldest family run ice cream merchants in American history with us today. They turned a unique recipe into an international best seller.</p><p>Joining us right now is Bassetts Ice Cream vice president of distribution, Alex Bassett Strange. Great to have you, Alex. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ALEX BASSETT STRANGE, VICE PRESIDENT OF DISTRIBUTION, BASSETTS ICE CREAM: Good morning. Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, six generations. Tell us about the company.</p><p>STRANGE: Well, so we are America's oldest ice cream brand, we've been around since 1861. The company was started by my great, great, great grandfather. We are based in Philadelphia, we are in the Reading Terminal Market. In Philadelphia we have -- that's where our company owned retail store is. We've been making ice cream and serving it there in the Reading Terminal Market for 158 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. And you've gone international, right? So you also sell in Asia.</p><p>STRANGE: We do -- we do. We actually -- we started selling into China in 2008. And then just within the last three years started in Korea.</p><p>BEVAN: How many different flavors and what's your most popular flavor?</p><p>STRANGE: We've got up over 40 flavors. Our most popular believe it or not is vanilla.</p><p>BEVAN: OK.</p><p>MALIK: Wow, not chocolate?</p><p>STRANGE: Not chocolates. So vanilla's our top flavor. Actually, what's interesting about our vanilla, it's a Philadelphia style vanilla ice cream. So Philadelphia style ice cream in general means that there's no egg yolk and whenever possible, we use very high quality Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. This recipes -- this recipes that you're tasting there was formulated by my great grandfather.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is awesome.</p><p>STRANGE: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STRANGE: That one right there is the Mint Chocolate Chip.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mint Chocolate Chip.</p><p>STRANGE: That's a top --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very good.</p><p>STRANGE: That's a top flavor for us.</p><p>BEVAN: Do you have to offer like a low fat option as well or --</p><p>STRANGE: So --</p><p>BEVAN: I'm asking for myself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yogurt.</p><p>STRANGE: We're a high fat ice cream. 16-1/2 percent butter fat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.</p><p>STRANGE: We do offer four different sorbet flavor options. But we're a through and through ice cream company.</p><p>BEVAN: Got it.</p><p>FERRIS: The '90s are over, we're not like (INAUDIBLE). It seems like an area where there's a lot of new artisanal brands coming out. I mean, every time I go like there's a bunch of nine, and eight and $10.00 pints. Is that helping this (INAUDIBLE) because there's a lot of growth in consumption or is it like digging in to like the vintage versus the more like hipster artisanal brands?</p><p>STRANGE: Well, I definitely see that the craft ice cream industry has being a really an interesting one. And it kind of -- in my mind it parallels the craft beer business. I see a lot of artisanal ice creams coming in and there's a really great community of them, especially in Philadelphia, we all work together. We -- Bassetts Ice Cream distributes some, so we have six trucks that we run distribution out of. We work with some smaller independents in the Philadelphia area. We collaborate on flavors. It's just really good and collaborative market.</p><p>FERRIS: Yes, how did you make this? And I think (INAUDIBLE) was it like lake ice from like the great lakes or something? Like, how did you even --</p><p>STRANGE: So my great, great, great grandfather was a Quaker school teacher in Salem, New Jersey, just outside of Philadelphia. And he got into the ice cream business, I guess he loved ice cream and wanted to experiment with making it. Lore is that we started churning by mule power.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>STRANGE: And then he would cart it in, horse and buggy into the farmer's markets in Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How great. Are you seeing any impact from the China tariffs?</p><p>STRANGE: We are. The trade war's really slowed our business down in China quite a bit. We're hopeful that we can put that behind us and get going again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Any plans for further expansion internationally? How about Europe?</p><p>STRANGE: Nothing going in Europe right now but we are looking at some other Asian countries. We actually just sent a container over to the Philippines which is pretty exciting for us. We're also talking with a couple other countries and we're loving the international stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great. Alex, it's good to have you on the program. Congratulations.</p><p>STRANGE: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, made in America , Alex Bassett Strange, Bassetts Ice Cream.</p><p>Still ahead, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar blasting Israel, going as far as to question whether it's an ally. What they said, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019082002cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVY-2KX1-JB20-G183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>President Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Reserve</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Greece</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iranian</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple T.V.

I would also like to thank the female vice-chairs, an excellent choice for this year, and, in the same vein, I would like to thank our vice-chairs as well as the heads of state and government present here today and all our friends in the room. Crisis of globalization You mentioned the paradoxes of globalization. And upon arriving here, the most evident paradox, to me, is to be talking about globalization in a place totally cut off from the rest of the world by snow. </p><p>One thing is certain here in Davos. When you look through the window, especially when you arrive here in this building, it is really very hard to believe in global warming. Thankfully - and of course - you didn't invite any climate sceptics this year. You decided to touch on a certain number of challenges here in our environment, and my first response is to talk about these challenges in France and in Europe. I must say that we have already implemented a certain number of measures which I will review here for you and we are going to continue with this same momentum. But we must not be na\u00efve; globalization is currently in crisis, a significant crisis. And this huge challenge requires a joint effort from international organizations, states, businesses and civil society to find and implement solutions. This is why I think your choice of theme for this year is completely justified and this is why I am here today: to launch a call for action. I call upon all of you present here today: we must act. Reforms in FranceFrance has been profoundly affected by structural changes and its relationship with them and what is at stake. And while I stand here before you today, a few months ago I was really unsure whether I would be here; I had to battle against a nationalist party, but why? Because the people of my country were focused on misgivings, fears over globalization. Why were they so afraid? Because the expected results did not come to fruition, results were relatively weak: unemployment, public deficit, lack of growth. And we have yet to resolve all of these problems. But also because certain individuals offered the French people the opportunity to simply leave globalization behind. But this alternative is offered in every country and this has given me a special responsibility: the responsibility of building a prosperous France, a France which is open to the world but also capable of recognizing and accepting and including those left behind by globalization. We must be able to show that it is fairer for the middle classes. This is the challenge of 'at the same time' which I have tried to coordinate in France and which is currently the subject of debate in France. The situation is very clear: we must make France more competitive and more innovative to finance a fair system. It is my aim to make France more competitive in a European context. Let me review the pillars of this strategy here for you now. Firstly, I would like to talk about human capital. Our world has changed and, today, we need fewer arms and more brains; we need educated, trained individuals. France's men and women must be able to adapt to change and must be educated effectively. We have therefore started to profoundly reform our education system today, and no later than today, to educate and train our citizens because when we look at the rankings - and Angel Gurr\u00eda is with us on this -, I am sorry about the last few years but, as it stands, we have dropped down the tables. We must therefore bring about genuine reform for our education system, reform the rules dictating access to university to provide better access. And more generally speaking, we now need to think about how we can better invest in this education system and better reform it. In addition to this reform, we will also reform the apprenticeship and professional training system. These are two really crucial elements in our education reform. Why? Because if we want to support people in this global change, we must offer them something. These last few years, both the left and the right promised to protect individuals from change. But sometimes we need to step up change! On the contrary, we must stay anchored in reality and provide genuine protection for people, genuine protection which is achieved through training to enable these people to get a job. We must invest heavily in education and training and we will also make the whole system simpler and more effective. At the same time, we will also have to innovate in our economy, particularly through research and development. We are going to maintain and enhance our tax incentive mechanisms as well as create a fund of  10 billion to finance research and innovation programmes, especially for disruptive innovation. We are also going to develop innovation programmes which we are going to launch. Here again, we will focus on research and human capital. The second pillar of this agenda or group of reforms is investment and capital. In an economy like that of France, as you well know, the innovation and skills economy requires a competitive financial system, which we have in France but which is focused more on salaries than capital. We require more capital, more funds in this field to finance risks and key innovations. We have therefore also adopted a whole series of reforms to orient our savings in this direction or towards this type of financing. Negotiations are currently under way even on a European and global level to give greater priority to projects, good sustainable projects. Tangible measures have just been adopted to facilitate this sort of work. We have considerably reduced corporate taxation from 33%. We have also reformed capital gains tax and taken other measures which should enable us to become more competitive. So why are we doing all of this? The ultimate goal is to ramp-up the recovery, speed up the return of our competitiveness and, by reducing labour costs, we will also bolster France's attractiveness. We are therefore investing in innovation financing, notably for disruptive technologies, to bolster this model. And our third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. In today's world, education and new safety nets are essential to protect people, but we need much more flexible structures and more flexible rules to adapt to change, to help companies of all sizes - large corporations and start-ups - to change business models to adapt to the new environment. This is why we adopted a very important labour market reform last summer whose principal philosophy, in a nutshell, is to align ourselves with Germany and northern Europe, with fewer rules set out in law and far more rules defined by consensus, both for companies and for branches. This will allow companies to better adapt to their environment. This represents a huge change. It makes us more competitive and much more productive and I think that it is a reform that has been long awaited. Acceleration and flexibility also require a whole series of micro-economic reforms on housing, energy, transportation so as to reduce the overall costs for citizens, improve competitiveness and make our economy faster, more efficient in critical sectors. The fourth pillar of this strategy is that we have also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change. This is a huge advantage in competitiveness. We must absolutely stop thinking that climate change and productivity are not compatible. Because we must attract talent, and talent will come to places that are good to live in, where life is good! I do not know whether you really need convincing on this, but either way, we require a strategy which is focused on fighting climate change. We have also adopted a certain number of measures in this field to ramp-up the green strategy particularly as regards CO2 emissions and reducing them, of course. What does this mean? By 2021, France will be completely coal-free. This means that we will launch more research and development programmes and we have already attracted numerous research projects and start-ups through the Make Our Planet Great Again programme which has brought numerous projects to France. The fifth pillar of this national strategy - and it is the last one, I can reassure you -, is cultural change. And for me, this is just as important as tangible reforms, laws and decrees, etc. Cultural change is all about moving towards red tape cuts and simplification. France is famous for its numerous regulations and its very complicated tax law. Why? Because we love politics. And I have managed inequalities better than other economies. However, we haven't prevented inequality, we have corrected it using an extremely complex system and these corrections weakened our competitiveness and our growth. We will therefore adopt a strategy to avoid inequalities and I will come back to this later on, but at the same time we are going to simplify the processes, we are going to streamline bureaucracy and simplify it above all. We have taken a whole series of tangible measures to fuel this change of mindset, change of culture. Over the last six months, we have cut the number of new regulations like crazy and we have reduced the number of bureaucratic steps and we have now passed a law to completely change the relationship between administration, entrepreneurs and citizens. Next comes visibility. We have to guarantee stability for people, entrepreneurs, citizens, investors. All the reforms that I have mentioned about taxation are aimed at streamlining, and we have adopted a five-year taxation strategy. This is a completely new thing, because it is easy to come here and tell you: I have changed the tax system for this year and then I am going to change it again next year. Because unpredictability is completely counterproductive. Visibility is therefore very important. So this is our strategy, a strategy over five years, and we are not going to change it for the next five years. So this is my commitment, my commitment and my governance. The third very important point is risk. This is central to cultural change. In France, I have always said that it is forbidden to fail but it is also forbidden to be successful. So you can see that there is a relatively small margin, there is not much room to manoeuvre. Today, it should be easier to fail, which means taking risks. So to reduce the cost of failure, to encourage people to come back and start again and to facilitate success and allow it to happen, we have decided to take a different approach to risk. If you take a risk, you should be rewarded, and if you fail, then you should be allowed to fail. This is what I mean when I talk about the change in mindset, the change in culture that we are trying to bring in France. Because France is a nation of entrepreneurs, it is a nation of people who love taking risks, and it was a big mistake, if you look at our history, not to authorize this risk and not give us enough room to manoeuvre. Europe My key message is that France is back. France is back at the core of Europe because there can be no French success without European success. And for me, all these initiatives and reforms have a counterpart, which is European strategy. And I see many European leaders here today, they are dear friends, and we are all working very hard together to make this strategy a reality. I know that Angela Merkel expressed this vision a few hours ago, and we are working closely on this together. I would, in summary, like you to know that my key strategy for the coming year and this year is to deliver a refoundation of Europe. We must fix some short-term issues on energy, digital technology, migration and investment, this is the programme for 2018. But this year will be the year where we will have to redesign a 10-year strategy for Europe because, in the current context, Europe has a responsibility and a role vis-\u00e0-vis China and the US, because our vision, our DNA, in terms of the relationship between freedom, justice, fairness and individual rights, is unique. You can only find this balance of values in Europe. There is a strong preference for freedom in the US but the approach to fairness is very different. And in China, aspirations are different again. But it is the relationship between these four values that are the basis for our multilateral approach and our approach to globalization. This was created in Europe, and we need a stronger Europe to avoid the fragmentation of the world; this is absolutely key. My view is that we have to redesign a 10-year strategy, not just an overnight strategy. To make Europe an actual economic, green, social, scientific and political power. We need a new strategy for European power in these fields and we therefore need more ambition to achieve a more sovereign, more united and more democratic Europe. Migration, digital technology, energy, defence, development, finance, investment - the core of what makes us sovereign in this environment - will be at the heart of our common policies. I am not na\u00efve, we are not going to build something sufficiently ambitious as 27 countries, and by that I do not mean that it is impossible as 27, no, I just mean that we must start by working as 27. But we need to be more ambitious, for an open avant-garde of Europe to achieve something in these critical fields that I have mentioned. We must not wait for everyone around the table to be ready to make progress. So if some are ready to be more ambitious and push ahead in what makes us sovereign in this global environment to defend our values and interests, let's move! We are open, the window and the door is always open. But those who do not want to move forward should not be able to block those in this room who have ambition because I think that it is ambition that will enable our Eurozone to become stronger, fairer, more ambitious and more capable of delivering a coherent message about what we wish to achieve in this environment. Last September, I made a big speech on this issue, we have worked hard on this, but I hope that with my friends here in this room, we can work together to draw up this shared strategy for the next 10 years by the end of this year so that we can give our people and the rest of the world visibility of a new power capable of cooperating. Because, my friends, I would like to make a confession: I want France to find its rightful place in global competition and that the condition for that is a stronger Europe with new ambition. But this is not an end in itself. Economic growth is not an end in itself and I think we have often made the mistake, in recent times too, of making speeches that say: you will see, everything will turn out for the better, because there will be growth. Responses to globalization We can ensure that growth is one or two percentage points higher, this is the battle we are engaged in, but it does not sort out all issues. Economic growth is not an end, it remains a means. I would even go as far as to say that the desire for economic growth has sometimes made us forget what people are prepared to accept to obtain it. The globalization crisis that we are currently going through is linked to this. The world is fragmented by a series of new economic and geopolitical phenomena, some of which we could have anticipated, which are related to this fracturing. Firstly, we thought, or we had people believe, that growth affected everyone, we said: more growth will resolve all the problems in emerging countries, in intermediate countries or developed economies. This is not true because this growth is becoming less and less fair from a structural perspective. All international analyses have shown, be they by multinational institutions or NGOs, that wealth is always concentrated in the top 1%. Why is this? Firstly, the way we have financed globalization has promoted the concentration of wealth, and secondly new technologies, this new innovation and skills economy that I mentioned earlier, because it is an economy of superstars. It favours very talented people and concentrates wealth on the most talented people. A tax system in every country cannot be the answer, we would need to coordinate ourselves very carefully, because otherwise the talent will leave. I can assure you, France has tested this method very well. Lack of cooperation and coordination does not work! It is not a good idea. However, not reacting at all to this issue is not a good idea either. People tell us: 'we are in a great world, distances are getting shorter, everything is getting faster', but in our societies, everything is becoming divided again. We have societies which are composed of nomads who make great use of globalization and whose life, whose daily life, whose fate is closer to people who are in Bombay or San Francisco than the people who live on the same floor of the same building. This creates a genuine risk for democracy because it produces a misalignment on issues and subjects, and what makes democratic consensus. This is what we are heading for. Here, in this room, we think about these issues, but only a few tens of kilometres from here are people who firmly believe that the solution is to leave globalization behind, and more and more people are convinced that this is the right answer. As you can see, the challenge facing us is far from small. The challenge does not just concern governments. Firstly, for several years now I believe governments and states have been going in the wrong direction. We are talking, in part, about democratic challenges. Many governments are tempted to respond with a nationalist approach saying 'you're right, this is not okay, we are going to close our borders'. Then there is the fear factor - large-scale migration, terrorism, major technological changes: these are challenges which require international coordination. I am talking about Europe but also much wider than Europe. If we cannot cooperate then we cannot solve these challenges and we will always be looking for comparative advantages over each other. And the drive for comparative advantage always pulls us down. It is a race to the bottom on all these issues. Multilateral cooperation This non-cooperative race fundamentally prevents us from meeting these fears and what keeps our nations together. I believe that states have been going in the wrong direction because the tendency recently has been to make multilateralism more fragile in the face of these issues. Be it the UN, the IMF, the WTO, more and more people have attacked these institutions, saying: 'We are going to take our rights back, we have our own approach, we are creating alternative systems'. We should make no mistake, all these structures grew out of what Professor Schwab was talking about, this period in history where we saw what happened when governments adopted this approach of non-cooperation in the face of long-standing fears. And so for several years, we have been approaching this subject from the wrong direction. If you look at labour and tax law, all those subjects which are, to some extent, the core of a state, we can see a big lack of cooperation and a continuous weakening of positions. I have already explained what I am doing for France. France was somehow very out of step with the rest of Europe, it was far above the European average on all of these issues. But when I look at the current global momentum, the momentum on tax or labour issues is in the direction of continuing to explain to people: friends, the right answer is to cut back! The best response is to cut taxes! There is no limit! It is a race to the bottom! This is true for the labour matters as well. If we do not define a standard for international cooperation, we will never manage to convince the middle and working classes, that globalization is good for them. This is not true! This is not true! Regarding trade, we are going back to strategies that are not cooperative, towards protectionism, towards breaking up what the WTO has done and the threat of certain regional agreements, and we are unravelling what globalization has accomplished. And regarding the climate, many were with me on 12 December in Paris: we are not living up to our commitments - in other words, we are losing the battle. 2020 is not the time for another conference. If we have not delivered concrete results, we will not be in a position to explain to people that they are increasingly vulnerable, we will have been fully aware of what we have done. Therefore, regarding all these issues - which are issues I would say that we know well and around which we have been able to organize ourselves -, we are breaking up our international organization, we are weakening it. And on top of that, there are new issues that we had not yet seen: accelerated urbanization, large-scale migrations and technological change that you have perfectly explained. And each brings with it new inequalities, new changes that scare people a great deal and that too often we consider in an uncooperative way. We have not established a global organization that allows us to think about all the consequences of these technological changes, artificial intelligence, for example, or Big Data. Today we have a strategy that is completely uncooperative regarding these issues. In Europe, we do not yet have a real strategy. In the United States, there is a strategy that is left to big private sector companies that we all love and use on a daily basis on our devices and our Internet platforms, but which have privatized this issue with all its effects in terms of individual freedoms and confidentiality. And in China, this issue is managed in a completely public way, with data controlled according to other standards than the ones we are seeking. But there has never been a multilateral approach to this issue that is set to destroy millions of jobs, change privacy rules and thereby shape how citizens see the world. Yet in the future, it will change medicine, knowledge that I have about you in terms of whether or not you can be treated, and even national solidarity. In other words - and I do not want to paint an even worse picture -, we are doing everything we can to encourage these technological changes in France, but we are not being careful. If we do not establish some kind of framework for them, Schumpeter is very quickly going to look like Darwin. To live in a completely Darwinian world is not good. And it is certainly not good for our populations and for all of those who, living in democracies, are the ones to decide this. Faced with these realities and transformations, and I would like to finish with this question, what are our challenges and how can we address them? And aside from what we are doing in our countries and what we need to do for Europe, I think we still have to find some sort of framework, some basic rules for the common good. We have common goods and these goods are now global. They include sustainable economic development, the environment, health, education, security and social cohesion, human rights. And we can never decide to renounce them. And we must in our strategies and in our approaches manage to set them out and create effective forums to sometimes refine regulations on these common goods in a cooperative way. I say this with governments but also the private sector in mind. No one can accuse me of not being business friendly; no one can accuse me of not having a positive approach to openness, to economic development. But I say to you frankly here today: this approach must produce results. In a way, this is my job, the job of the government and I hope of all those who in the private sector will come because they have confidence. This will help them generate jobs and develop. Even in France, if I do not give meaning back to this globalization, and if I do not manage to explain to people that it is good for them and it helps deal with daily problems and they have a role to play in it, in five years, in 10 years, in 15 years, the nationalists, the extremists, those suggesting we leave this system, will win. And this will be true in every country. And so we cannot simply watch in fear saying how awful it is when nationalists, extremists and people with terrorist or inward-looking messages in certain other countries win. No, the challenge is now in our own back yards and we need to determine whether we know how to rebuild a genuine global contract and a genuine contract that is not that of governments. I am being very frank in saying that if this contract is not included in the investors' model, banks' model, in the entrepreneurs' model, if every man and woman does not consider that they have a part in this global contract, then it will not work. For someone will always be tempted to use an uncooperative strategy, because there will always be some type of reward for free-riding. And the enemy of the common good is the free-rider. And we are falling into a situation where in our globalization, a majority of powers are becoming free-riders of common goods. That is what we are experiencing today. I think we need to base this new global contract on three commitments: the duty to invest, the duty to share and the duty to protect. I am sure that I have not covered everything and will not be able to touch on everything today. I will forget many topics because I do not want to be too long, but I would briefly like to explain these duties. The duty to invest means the states and the private sector need to invest in the common goods I just explained, especially health. But there is one area in which we have not been doing enough and that is education. Education I talked about it in the context of France's strategy. We must also have this conversation in Europe and all over the world, particularly in continents facing the most hardship. There are 750 million adults, two-thirds of whom are women, in the world who do not have the basic literacy skills. So if we have a priority for investment, it should be the education of girls. Because everywhere we do not invest in education, there will not be growth in the country, which means we will continue to have a predatory investment strategy in foreign countries in which we have invested. And if there is not investment for girls, there will be no gender equality. Women will not have a role and very often in the most difficult societies, when it comes to culture and sometimes religion and the economy, the solution lies in women and they are the ones building it. And the choice of certain countries to decrease the education of girls is deliberate in some places and we cannot stand by and say nothing. So to address this problem we need to invest massively. In Africa, in 2015, more than 101 million children were not enrolled in school, including 53 million girls. So next week, I will be with President Macky Sall and we will work to rebuild the Global Partnership for Education. It is essential for all states here today to commit massively. However, I would also like to see - and this has never been done before - investors and businesses commit to investing a euro for the education of girls for every euro they invest in Africa! If not, that means you are investing over the short term because when you are planning to open a mine or a transport infrastructure, this is wonderful - generally governments assist you and provide guarantees, there is plenty of funding available to help you to do that - but now you should do something to truly stabilize the country. Therefore it is absolutely essential to establish a genuine public-private contract when it comes to education and its investment. And more generally, you have understood, investing in development, having a much more ambitious development strategy than the one we collectively have today is imperative if we are to avoid this fragmentation of the world. Value-sharing The second duty is to share. Sharing value is a debate that is older than we are and one that has always contributed to capitalism. But there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars and based on finance, and we have to admit that the spreading of value added is no longer equitable. Sometimes we say that it is not that distorted but that is because we fail to consider how much superstars are being paid for their work. We therefore have to establish real mechanisms to share added value. I sincerely believe in widespread use of profit-sharing schemes and social and environmental responsibility systems. You have understood that I do not believe that the response lies in taxation in a country. But the more businesses take on social and environmental responsibility and decide to discuss, within the company, the fair distribution of the benefits of growth and success, when it happens, the more attention there will be given, in investment mechanisms and investment criteria, to value distribution within the company, causing the company to endure, the more we will build truly sustainable capitalism in terms of sharing. Do not be mistaken, the companies in this room that have been around the longest are those that have many more value-distribution strategies and genuine employee profit-sharing strategies than other companies. And again, I sincerely believe that the solution lies in companies and investors which have this greater equity. And when I speak of equitable sharing of value in companies I am also referring to gender equality. We have launched a strategy in France in this area to bridge the unequal pay gap in my five-year term. We are taking the initiative with the World Economic Forum to introduce indicators and I think that it is very important to have more visibility in the area in the private sector and I would like to commend you for your very strong commitment to this issue. However I also think that we must collectively go further and I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau regarding the G7 and who decided to put this issue on the top of the G7's agenda as Canada will host this year's summit. I today reiterate that he can count on my full support. If we also want to share value better, it must be done across all sectors. Taxation is a key issue that I briefly raised when I spoke about the challenges of the contemporary world. If we want to better share value and better share the financing of common goods in today's world, we must also have a much more coordinated tax strategy at global level. The 'race to the bottom' means the end to the financing of common goods and any amount of sharing. That is where we have a great deal of collective work to do so as not to head in the wrong direction. The OECD has done a massive amount of work on this issue which has enabled progress to be made on the base erosion and profit sharing (BEPS) initiative. We signed a multilateral convention and France has begun the ratification procedure. This is a key treaty and I strongly encourage the United States and China to sign it. It will not be effective if the United States and China are not involved. There is no real discourse on globalization if these two major powers are not taking part. Because it is a genuine partnership agreement on this issue to avoid base erosion. It is the decision we made to have a peaceful tax cooperation framework that prevents tax optimization strategies of groups and companies, and to promote morality, it has to be said, in the way profits are made. I am very frank in saying that if you believe everything you have heard or the things you considered relevant or everything that you could have said in Davos, then you cannot continue to conduct tax optimization as it is being conducted today and you must join this fight. Because that would only mean that you consider that your sector, your business must finance common goods because we are in a world in which common goods need to be financed. And therefore we must renounce unbridled tax optimization and I hope that we can advance even further in this area. There is obviously a second topic that is extremely important in the area of taxation, which is figuring out actual taxation globally of digital technology. Big tech companies are essential to our societies in terms of innovation and I have always welcomed them in France. Every one of us wants to have them in our countries and wants to develop them, so let's not be hypocrites. But at the same time, we are seeing a dual injustice. I cannot say to a start-up in my country that it is going to become a market leader when the big tech companies do not pay taxes in my country, and the start-up does. And I cannot say disruption or technological change is a good thing when these big tech companies create changes that I would like to support and make happen but they do not pay taxes. Yet the start-up they disrupt in its business model pays taxes, including VAT, corporate tax and so on. It is not a fair model; that is clear! So we must end this unfair system and we must do it together so as not to reduce the competitiveness of any one country because of course, since we did not create a level playing field from the outset, we have created 'tax-attractive' hubs. We must do this in a relaxed way, as it is a common good and because the major digital technology players cause disruption, this will destroy millions of jobs around the world, and we will have to retrain millions of people. Education is a common good, and as I said, it must be paid for. If those who are destroying jobs do not help fund this retraining, including to create jobs in their own sector, I don't know how you or I could explain this to the middle and working classes. So we must find the right tax cooperation framework, and I hope that we will find it in Europe this year, I hope that the OECD will find it this year and that we can achieve international cooperation on this absolutely essential issue. Financial regulation Achieving this cooperation and better sharing means regaining the vibrancy of our financial cooperation, and our trade cooperation as we did following the 2008 and 2010 crises and which we have since then somewhat lost. And I would like to make some proposals on this issue: I am in favour of the IMF having the mandate to monitor the entire international financial system, entire sections of which are currently unregulated. We built the IMF, it gained legitimacy, it monitors states and part of the financial system, but it does not monitor the most deregulated actors and those working hardest to bring about deregulation! Bitcoin, virtual currencies, shadow banking, the most aggressive players on the financial markets, the ones who can create financial crises and deregulate systems, we have said, 'They cannot be part of the IMF'. We must discuss this issue, and I would like it to be discussed at the G20. I will see our Argentinian friend, President Macri, at the end of this week in Paris, and I know that he wants Argentina to provide strong G20 leadership, and the FSB has a crucial role to play in achieving this, and I want us to remain on this path to achieve increased regulation. We must also look at regulation from the perspectives of the principles held by the main international digital technology and innovation actors. There is financial instability as I have just mentioned, but there is also instability in our societies linked to technological innovation. We do not currently have a framework to examine when we will decide to stop this innovation, as it will have to be done at some point. At what point will we say that artificial intelligence is a red line as it does not disrupt old production systems, but rather our relationship with individual freedoms and respect for privacy, because this undermines the integrity of humans and living things, there are philosophical issues and matters of principle which we must examine. We must have the framework of international cooperation to limit this, to encourage technological innovation and help the major Internet platforms to continue developing our start-ups and innovation, but to be able to decide on the principles which cannot be decided by economic actors but by states. I want us to discuss this absolutely fundamental issue at the G20. Social protection and climate Finally, the last challenge is to protect, to protect socially, climatically and against terrorism. This is a duty if we want to remain in control of globalization and that also shows the importance of states in some of these challenges, and the return of states. For decades, we thought it very fashionable to say that states are finished, that private actors are the only way forward, but to rise to these challenges we do need states and international cooperation. As regards social issues, we must buck this trend of unravelling our social legislation to adjust globalization and on that too, I would like us to have a discussion at the G20 so that the monitoring carried out by the IMF and major institutions, among others, would include monitoring national reforms for social cohesion, and so that support can also be provided on these issues, so that we in Europe look at social convergence when providing particular assistance to cohesion mechanisms, so that our mechanisms can have criteria for monitoring the social convergence between our countries. And we must stop the complete contradiction of saying this in international bodies, while sometimes asking countries, the same ones, to relax their social legislation to be able to make adjustments at suboptimal level and which does not provide the minimum protection which is fully required. And thus on social issues too, I want to restore the strong dialogue between the ILO and the IMF, and successfully set up such criteria. We have discussed climate a lot and made many commitments, but out actions have not yet matched these commitments. I would like to commend China's strong commitment to continue to observe the Paris Agreement and to set up a carbon market, which is an essential part of our shared action in the area. This Forum was opened by Prime Minister Modi, and I would like to commend India's commitment to the International Solar Alliance; he has played a key role and this too is an essential part of the transition. But we must now see actions which are in line with the Paris Agreement. What does that mean collectively? Firstly, the European Union must go a little further and decide on a floor price for CO2. If we cannot do this in the coming months, we will not be credible, we have set up a carbon market, we must speed up the transition for our actors and we must thus have a minimum CO2 price and change the production model in Europe to bring it in line with these commitments. Secondly, I was in China a few weeks ago and was very impressed by President Xi's diplomatic initiative, which he presented to you last year, but this means that the entire One Belt One Road initiative must be in line with our climate commitments. These new silk roads must be green, they cannot be roads to the coal plant, they must be roads to renewables, to energies which reduce CO2 emissions, and we must all cooperate to uphold this commitment. Thirdly, this means that we must continue to go further and by 2020, I would like us to be true players in a Global Compact for the Environment which would be a genuine legal watchdog for our companies and a tool for environmental justice for our citizens. Finally, the private sector must play an active role in these commitments, 12 major initiatives were taken at the 'One Planet Summit' in Paris on 12 December, and I hope we can monitor them regularly and that all investors, all major donors and companies which have made pledges can issue regular reports and demonstrate that the private sector is fully committed. And the financial system must support this transition by fully promoting green finance. I think that finance is a good thing, as I have said, we are not financing innovation or its changes, but it must also finance a sustainable development model and Europe has a key role to play in this area, in the European Union and the Eurozone we must have a genuine green financial market capable of accelerating the funding of these transition models. Terrorism This duty to protect is a duty to provide security to our nations and citizens. As I conclude, I cannot, of course, bring up this essential issue without sharing a few convictions. The first is that we are and will remain enduringly committed to fighting terrorism. Our security forces are currently serving in a range of conflicts, whether against state powers, or against terrorists with varying levels of organization, in Africa, the Sahel and many other regions of the world. In this fight, we must continue working within our military and diplomatic coalitions, with clearly defined principles. I want this fight to continue multilaterally, we cannot leave this framework which would be like acknowledging that the fight against terrorism must lead to the world being restructured and divided. We are combatting organized groups who want to destroy others but this must not justify dividing up our global environment. And maintaining multilateralism also means maintaining a strategy in which we put pressure on regional powers causing us concern such as Iran or North Korea, while never engaging in escalation or the division of certain regions. Lastly, this fight must always take place in a diplomatic and political framework, because without a diplomatic and political solution to the fight against terrorism, terrorism will come back. We must be honest with ourselves; sometimes we have created situations which have led to terrorism by trying to unilaterally remove a tyrant because we did not wish to resolve all the problems. We cannot supplant citizens' sovereignty, assuage their frustrations, and sometimes their suffering, and so only stable, pluralistic, sustainable political solutions can strongly fight terrorism because they prevent these frustrations from returning in different countries. And so our role, is not only to win the war against terrorism, but to put in place the conditions for sustainable peace in the regions of the world that are currently engaged in this fight. The Middle East and, of course, Africa, come to mind. Our cooperation is indispensable on these issues, as is our strategy for building peace because everything is interlinked and we must give back meaning to the globalization that we are supporting in these regions. This is where development policy and our diplomatic policy are inextricably linked to our military policy. If you work to fight terrorism in a country but you have no development strategy, no education strategy, you can make great progress and claim victory, but the causes which led to terrorism will still remain. This applies to this entire global agenda. Terrorism came back in the Sahel because we did not step up to the plate on development, because we retreated on education, because we did not meet the challenges of climate change and the shrinking of Lake Chad, which has caused a genuine economic and moral crisis in the whole region. And it is the jihadists and their various associated groups that have provided the solution. And so you see, the fight against terrorism might be a military fight, a diplomatic fight, but it requires us to tackle all the challenges that I have just mentioned. As you can appreciate, and I would like to finish with this, the core of the new global deal is not only to involve all stakeholders, but we must also be obsessed by fighting the free-rider strategy, which also requires us to be coherent in our approaches. We should no longer sign trade agreements with those who fail to respect out shared standards on the climate, health, tax and labour. We should stop discussing certain subjects with powers if they no longer fulfil our criteria. We should have a coherent agenda on public goods. This will not happen overnight but we should be honest about our incoherences - something that we are progressively doing - rather than continue on our diverging paths and enhance our incoherences. This framework must be based on cooperation and multilateralism and must absolutely not be based on a new sort of hegemony, a fascination with new powers as this would be a huge mistake. We currently have a huge responsibility, because this new framework is the only way of protecting our interests, common goods and populations in the long-term. The answer can partly be found in this room and to a certain extent the new barriers are not technological or geographical barriers but rather our commitment, we are our own barriers in our own conscience. If we commit to making globalization fairer, favourable to the middle classes, if we commit to taking into account the long-term complexity of our decisions and not just their short-term results we can come together and build a new globalization which is understandable and good for our citizens. Coming back to this great idea of progress, we, as governments, as businesses, have the solution but we must simply answer one question: do we decide to act, to forge ahead or not? Now is the time! Thank you. \u00b9Mr.\u00a0Macron spoke in English and French.

And upon arriving here, the most evident paradox, to me, is to be talking about globalization in a place totally cut off from the rest of the world by snow. One thing is certain here in Davos. When you look through the window, especially when you arrive here in this building, it is really very hard to believe in global warming. Thankfully and of course you didn't invite any climate sceptics this year.</p><p>You decided to touch on a certain number of challenges here in our environment, and my first response is to talk about these challenges in France and in Europe. I must say that we have already implemented a certain number of measures which I will review here for you and we are going to continue with this same momentum.</p><p>But we must not be na\u00afve; globalization is currently in crisis, a significant crisis. And this huge challenge requires a joint effort from international organizations, states, businesses and civil society to find and implement solutions. This is why I think your choice of theme for this year is completely justified and this is why I am here today: to launch a call for action. I call upon all of you present here today: we must act.</p><p>Reforms in France</p><p>France has been profoundly affected by structural changes and its relationship with them and what is at stake. And while I stand here before you today, a few months ago I was really unsure whether I would be here; I had to battle against a nationalist party, but why? Because the people of my country were focused on misgivings, fears over globalization. Why were they so afraid? Because the expected results did not come to fruition, results were relatively weak: unemployment, public deficit, lack of growth. And we have yet to resolve all of these problems. But also because certain individuals offered the French people the opportunity to simply leave globalization behind.</p><p>But this alternative is offered in every country and this has given me a special responsibility: the responsibility of building a prosperous France, a France which is open to the world but also capable of recognizing and accepting and including those left behind by globalization.</p><p>We must be able to show that it is fairer for the middle classes. This is the challenge of \"at the same time\" which I have tried to coordinate in France and which is currently the subject of debate in France. The situation is very clear: we must make France more competitive and more innovative to finance a fair system. It is my aim to make France more competitive in a European context. Let me review the pillars of this strategy here for you now.</p><p>Firstly, I would like to talk about human capital. Our world has changed and, today, we need fewer arms and more brains; we need educated, trained individuals. France's men and women must be able to adapt to change and must be educated effectively. We have therefore started to profoundly reform our education system today, and no later than today, to educate and train our citizens because when we look at the rankings and Angel Gurra is with us on this , I am sorry about the last few years but, as it stands, we have dropped down the tables.</p><p>We must therefore bring about genuine reform for our education system, reform the rules dictating access to university to provide better access. And more generally speaking, we now need to think about how we can better invest in this education system and better reform it. In addition to this reform, we will also reform the apprenticeship and professional training system. These are two really crucial elements in our education reform. Why? Because if we want to support people in this global change, we must offer them something. These last few years, both the left and the right promised to protect individuals from change. But sometimes we need to step up change! On the contrary, we must stay anchored in reality and provide genuine protection for people, genuine protection which is achieved through training to enable these people to get a job.</p><p>We must invest heavily in education and training and we will also make the whole system simpler and more effective. At the same time, we will also have to innovate in our economy, particularly through research and development. We are going to maintain and enhance our tax incentive mechanisms as well as create a fund of 10 billion to finance research and innovation programmes, especially for disruptive innovation. We are also going to develop innovation programmes which we are going to launch. Here again, we will focus on research and human capital.</p><p>The second pillar of this agenda or group of reforms is investment and capital. In an economy like that of France, as you well know, the innovation and skills economy requires a competitive financial system, which we have in France but which is focused more on salaries than capital. We require more capital, more funds in this field to finance risks and key innovations. We have therefore also adopted a whole series of reforms to orient our savings in this direction or towards this type of financing. Negotiations are currently under way even on a European and global level to give greater priority to projects, good sustainable projects.</p><p>Tangible measures have just been adopted to facilitate this sort of work. We have considerably reduced corporate taxation from 33%. We have also reformed capital gains tax and taken other measures which should enable us to become more competitive. So why are we doing all of this? The ultimate goal is to ramp-up the recovery, speed up the return of our competitiveness and, by reducing labour costs, we will also bolster France's attractiveness. We are therefore investing in innovation financing, notably for disruptive technologies, to bolster this model.</p><p>And our third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. In today's world, education and new safety nets are essential to protect people, but we need much more flexible structures and more flexible rules to adapt to change, to help companies of all sizes large corporations and start-ups to change business models to adapt to the new environment. This is why we adopted a very important labour market reform last summer whose principal philosophy, in a nutshell, is to align ourselves with Germany and northern Europe, with fewer rules set out in law and far more rules defined by consensus, both for companies and for branches. This will allow companies to better adapt to their environment. This represents a huge change. It makes us more competitive and much more productive and I think that it is a reform that has been long awaited.</p><p>Acceleration and flexibility also require a whole series of micro-economic reforms on housing, energy, transportation so as to reduce the overall costs for citizens, improve competitiveness and make our economy faster, more efficient in critical sectors.</p><p>The fourth pillar of this strategy is that we have also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change. This is a huge advantage in competitiveness. We must absolutely stop thinking that climate change and productivity are not compatible. Because we must attract talent, and talent will come to places that are good to live in, where life is good! I do not know whether you really need convincing on this, but either way, we require a strategy which is focused on fighting climate change. We have also adopted a certain number of measures in this field to ramp-up the green strategy particularly as regards CO2 emissions and reducing them, of course.</p><p>What does this mean? By 2021, France will be completely coal-free. This means that we will launch more research and development programmes and we have already attracted numerous research projects and start-ups through the Make Our Planet Great Again programme which has brought numerous projects to France.</p><p>The fifth pillar of this national strategy and it is the last one, I can reassure you , is cultural change. And for me, this is just as important as tangible reforms, laws and decrees, etc. Cultural change is all about moving towards red tape cuts and simplification. France is famous for its numerous regulations and its very complicated tax law. Why? Because we love politics. And I have managed inequalities better than other economies. However, we haven't prevented inequality, we have corrected it using an extremely complex system and these corrections weakened our competitiveness and our growth.</p><p>We will therefore adopt a strategy to avoid inequalities and I will come back to this later on, but at the same time we are going to simplify the processes, we are going to streamline bureaucracy and simplify it above all. We have taken a whole series of tangible measures to fuel this change of mindset, change of culture. Over the last six months, we have cut the number of new regulations like crazy and we have reduced the number of bureaucratic steps and we have now passed a law to completely change the relationship between administration, entrepreneurs and citizens.</p><p>Next comes visibility. We have to guarantee stability for people, entrepreneurs, citizens, investors. All the reforms that I have mentioned about taxation are aimed at streamlining, and we have adopted a five-year taxation strategy. This is a completely new thing, because it is easy to come here and tell you: I have changed the tax system for this year and then I am going to change it again next year. Because unpredictability is completely counterproductive. Visibility is therefore very important. So this is our strategy, a strategy over five years, and we are not going to change it for the next five years. So this is my commitment, my commitment and my governance.</p><p>The third very important point is risk. This is central to cultural change. In France, I have always said that it is forbidden to fail but it is also forbidden to be successful. So you can see that there is a relatively small margin, there is not much room to manoeuvre. Today, it should be easier to fail, which means taking risks. So to reduce the cost of failure, to encourage people to come back and start again and to facilitate success and allow it to happen, we have decided to take a different approach to risk. If you take a risk, you should be rewarded, and if you fail, then you should be allowed to fail. This is what I mean when I talk about the change in mindset, the change in culture that we are trying to bring in France. Because France is a nation of entrepreneurs, it is a nation of people who love taking risks, and it was a big mistake, if you look at our history, not to authorize this risk and not give us enough room to manoeuvre.</p><p>Europe</p><p>My key message is that France is back. France is back at the core of Europe because there can be no French success without European success. And for me, all these initiatives and reforms have a counterpart, which is European strategy. And I see many European leaders here today, they are dear friends, and we are all working very hard together to make this strategy a reality.</p><p>I know that Angela Merkel expressed this vision a few hours ago, and we are working closely on this together. I would, in summary, like you to know that my key strategy for the coming year and this year is to deliver a refoundation of Europe. We must fix some short-term issues on energy, digital technology, migration and investment, this is the programme for 2018. But this year will be the year where we will have to redesign a 10-year strategy for Europe because, in the current context, Europe has a responsibility and a role vis- -vis China and the US, because our vision, our DNA, in terms of the relationship between freedom, justice, fairness and individual rights, is unique. You can only find this balance of values in Europe.</p><p>There is a strong preference for freedom in the US but the approach to fairness is very different. And in China, aspirations are different again. But it is the relationship between these four values that are the basis for our multilateral approach and our approach to globalization. This was created in Europe, and we need a stronger Europe to avoid the fragmentation of the world; this is absolutely key. My view is that we have to redesign a 10-year strategy, not just an overnight strategy. To make Europe an actual economic, green, social, scientific and political power. We need a new strategy for European power in these fields and we therefore need more ambition to achieve a more sovereign, more united and more democratic Europe.</p><p>Migration, digital technology, energy, defence, development, finance, investment the core of what makes us sovereign in this environment will be at the heart of our common policies.</p><p>I am not na\u00afve, we are not going to build something sufficiently ambitious as 27 countries, and by that I do not mean that it is impossible as 27, no, I just mean that we must start by working as 27. But we need to be more ambitious, for an open avant-garde of Europe to achieve something in these critical fields that I have mentioned. We must not wait for everyone around the table to be ready to make progress.</p><p>So if some are ready to be more ambitious and push ahead in what makes us sovereign in this global environment to defend our values and interests, let's move! We are open, the window and the door is always open. But those who do not want to move forward should not be able to block those in this room who have ambition because I think that it is ambition that will enable our Eurozone to become stronger, fairer, more ambitious and more capable of delivering a coherent message about what we wish to achieve in this environment.</p><p>Last September, I made a big speech on this issue, we have worked hard on this, but I hope that with my friends here in this room, we can work together to draw up this shared strategy for the next 10 years by the end of this year so that we can give our people and the rest of the world visibility of a new power capable of cooperating.</p><p>Because, my friends, I would like to make a confession: I want France to find its rightful place in global competition and that the condition for that is a stronger Europe with new ambition. But this is not an end in itself. Economic growth is not an end in itself and I think we have often made the mistake, in recent times too, of making speeches that say: you will see, everything will turn out for the better, because there will be growth.</p><p>Responses to globalization</p><p>We can ensure that growth is one or two percentage points higher, this is the battle we are engaged in, but it does not sort out all issues. Economic growth is not an end, it remains a means. I would even go as far as to say that the desire for economic growth has sometimes made us forget what people are prepared to accept to obtain it. The globalization crisis that we are currently going through is linked to this. The world is fragmented by a series of new economic and geopolitical phenomena, some of which we could have anticipated, which are related to this fracturing.</p><p>Firstly, we thought, or we had people believe, that growth affected everyone, we said: more growth will resolve all the problems in emerging countries, in intermediate countries or developed economies. This is not true because this growth is becoming less and less fair from a structural perspective. All international analyses have shown, be they by multinational institutions or NGOs, that wealth is always concentrated in the top 1%. Why is this? Firstly, the way we have financed globalization has promoted the concentration of wealth, and secondly new technologies, this new innovation and skills economy that I mentioned earlier, because it is an economy of superstars. It favours very talented people and concentrates wealth on the most talented people.</p><p>A tax system in every country cannot be the answer, we would need to coordinate ourselves very carefully, because otherwise the talent will leave. I can assure you, France has tested this method very well. Lack of cooperation and coordination does not work! It is not a good idea. However, not reacting at all to this issue is not a good idea either. People tell us: \"we are in a great world, distances are getting shorter, everything is getting faster\", but in our societies, everything is becoming divided again.</p><p>We have societies which are composed of nomads who make great use of globalization and whose life, whose daily life, whose fate is closer to people who are in Bombay or San Francisco than the people who live on the same floor of the same building. This creates a genuine risk for democracy because it produces a misalignment on issues and subjects, and what makes democratic consensus. This is what we are heading for. Here, in this room, we think about these issues, but only a few tens of kilometres from here are people who firmly believe that the solution is to leave globalization behind, and more and more people are convinced that this is the right answer.</p><p>As you can see, the challenge facing us is far from small. The challenge does not just concern governments. Firstly, for several years now I believe governments and states have been going in the wrong direction. We are talking, in part, about democratic challenges. Many governments are tempted to respond with a nationalist approach saying \"you're right, this is not okay, we are going to close our borders\". Then there is the fear factor large-scale migration, terrorism, major technological changes: these are challenges which require international coordination. I am talking about Europe but also much wider than Europe. If we cannot cooperate then we cannot solve these challenges and we will always be looking for comparative advantages over each other. And the drive for comparative advantage always pulls us down. It is a race to the bottom on all these issues.</p><p>Multilateral cooperation</p><p>This non-cooperative race fundamentally prevents us from meeting these fears and what keeps our nations together. I believe that states have been going in the wrong direction because the tendency recently has been to make multilateralism more fragile in the face of these issues. Be it the UN, the IMF, the WTO, more and more people have attacked these institutions, saying: \"We are going to take our rights back, we have our own approach, we are creating alternative systems\". We should make no mistake, all these structures grew out of what Professor Schwab was talking about, this period in history where we saw what happened when governments adopted this approach of non-cooperation in the face of long-standing fears. And so for several years, we have been approaching this subject from the wrong direction.</p><p>If you look at labour and tax law, all those subjects which are, to some extent, the core of a state, we can see a big lack of cooperation and a continuous weakening of positions. I have already explained what I am doing for France. France was somehow very out of step with the rest of Europe, it was far above the European average on all of these issues. But when I look at the current global momentum, the momentum on tax or labour issues is in the direction of continuing to explain to people: friends, the right answer is to cut back! The best response is to cut taxes! There is no limit! It is a race to the bottom!</p><p>This is true for the labour matters as well. If we do not define a standard for international cooperation, we will never manage to convince the middle and working classes, that globalization is good for them. This is not true! This is not true! Regarding trade, we are going back to strategies that are not cooperative, towards protectionism, towards breaking up what the WTO has done and the threat of certain regional agreements, and we are unravelling what globalization has accomplished. And regarding the climate, many were with me on 12 December in Paris: we are not living up to our commitments in other words, we are losing the battle. 2020 is not the time for another conference. If we have not delivered concrete results, we will not be in a position to explain to people that they are increasingly vulnerable, we will have been fully aware of what we have done.</p><p>Therefore, regarding all these issues which are issues I would say that we know well and around which we have been able to organize ourselves , we are breaking up our international organization, we are weakening it. And on top of that, there are new issues that we had not yet seen: accelerated urbanization, large-scale migrations and technological change that you have perfectly explained. And each brings with it new inequalities, new changes that scare people a great deal and that too often we consider in an uncooperative way. We have not established a global organization that allows us to think about all the consequences of these technological changes, artificial intelligence, for example, or Big Data. Today we have a strategy that is completely uncooperative regarding these issues.</p><p>In Europe, we do not yet have a real strategy. In the United States, there is a strategy that is left to big private sector companies that we all love and use on a daily basis on our devices and our Internet platforms, but which have privatized this issue with all its effects in terms of individual freedoms and confidentiality. And in China, this issue is managed in a completely public way, with data controlled according to other standards than the ones we are seeking. But there has never been a multilateral approach to this issue that is set to destroy millions of jobs, change privacy rules and thereby shape how citizens see the world. Yet in the future, it will change medicine, knowledge that I have about you in terms of whether or not you can be treated, and even national solidarity.</p><p>In other words and I do not want to paint an even worse picture , we are doing everything we can to encourage these technological changes in France, but we are not being careful. If we do not establish some kind of framework for them, Schumpeter is very quickly going to look like Darwin. To live in a completely Darwinian world is not good. And it is certainly not good for our populations and for all of those who, living in democracies, are the ones to decide this.</p><p>Faced with these realities and transformations, and I would like to finish with this question, what are our challenges and how can we address them? And aside from what we are doing in our countries and what we need to do for Europe, I think we still have to find some sort of framework, some basic rules for the common good. We have common goods and these goods are now global. They include sustainable economic development, the environment, health, education, security and social cohesion, human rights. And we can never decide to renounce them. And we must in our strategies and in our approaches manage to set them out and create effective forums to sometimes refine regulations on these common goods in a cooperative way.</p><p>I say this with governments but also the private sector in mind. No one can accuse me of not being business friendly; no one can accuse me of not having a positive approach to openness, to economic development. But I say to you frankly here today: this approach must produce results. In a way, this is my job, the job of the government and I hope of all those who in the private sector will come because they have confidence. This will help them generate jobs and develop.</p><p>Even in France, if I do not give meaning back to this globalization, and if I do not manage to explain to people that it is good for them and it helps deal with daily problems and they have a role to play in it, in five years, in 10 years, in 15 years, the nationalists, the extremists, those suggesting we leave this system, will win. And this will be true in every country. And so we cannot simply watch in fear saying how awful it is when nationalists, extremists and people with terrorist or inward-looking messages in certain other countries win. No, the challenge is now in our own back yards and we need to determine whether we know how to rebuild a genuine global contract and a genuine contract that is not that of governments.</p><p>I am being very frank in saying that if this contract is not included in the investors' model, banks' model, in the entrepreneurs' model, if every man and woman does not consider that they have a part in this global contract, then it will not work. For someone will always be tempted to use an uncooperative strategy, because there will always be some type of reward for free-riding. And the enemy of the common good is the free-rider. And we are falling into a situation where in our globalization, a majority of powers are becoming free-riders of common goods. That is what we are experiencing today.</p><p>I think we need to base this new global contract on three commitments: the duty to invest, the duty to share and the duty to protect. I am sure that I have not covered everything and will not be able to touch on everything today. I will forget many topics because I do not want to be too long, but I would briefly like to explain these duties. The duty to invest means the states and the private sector need to invest in the common goods I just explained, especially health. But there is one area in which we have not been doing enough and that is education.</p><p>Education</p><p>I talked about it in the context of France's strategy. We must also have this conversation in Europe and all over the world, particularly in continents facing the most hardship. There are 750 million adults, two-thirds of whom are women, in the world who do not have the basic literacy skills. So if we have a priority for investment, it should be the education of girls. Because everywhere we do not invest in education, there will not be growth in the country, which means we will continue to have a predatory investment strategy in foreign countries in which we have invested.</p><p>And if there is not investment for girls, there will be no gender equality. Women will not have a role and very often in the most difficult societies, when it comes to culture and sometimes religion and the economy, the solution lies in women and they are the ones building it. And the choice of certain countries to decrease the education of girls is deliberate in some places and we cannot stand by and say nothing. So to address this problem we need to invest massively. In Africa, in 2015, more than 101 million children were not enrolled in school, including 53 million girls.</p><p>So next week, I will be with President Macky Sall and we will work to rebuild the Global Partnership for Education. It is essential for all states here today to commit massively. However, I would also like to see and this has never been done before investors and businesses commit to investing a euro for the education of girls for every euro they invest in Africa! If not, that means you are investing over the short term because when you are planning to open a mine or a transport infrastructure, this is wonderful generally governments assist you and provide guarantees, there is plenty of funding available to help you to do that but now you should do something to truly stabilize the country.</p><p>Therefore it is absolutely essential to establish a genuine public-private contract when it comes to education and its investment. And more generally, you have understood, investing in development, having a much more ambitious development strategy than the one we collectively have today is imperative if we are to avoid this fragmentation of the world.</p><p>Value-sharing</p><p>The second duty is to share. Sharing value is a debate that is older than we are and one that has always contributed to capitalism. But there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars and based on finance, and we have to admit that the spreading of value added is no longer equitable. Sometimes we say that it is not that distorted but that is because we fail to consider how much superstars are being paid for their work. We therefore have to establish real mechanisms to share added value. I sincerely believe in widespread use of profit-sharing schemes and social and environmental responsibility systems.</p><p>You have understood that I do not believe that the response lies in taxation in a country. But the more businesses take on social and environmental responsibility and decide to discuss, within the company, the fair distribution of the benefits of growth and success, when it happens, the more attention there will be given, in investment mechanisms and investment criteria, to value distribution within the company, causing the company to endure, the more we will build truly sustainable capitalism in terms of sharing.</p><p>Do not be mistaken, the companies in this room that have been around the longest are those that have many more value-distribution strategies and genuine employee profit-sharing strategies than other companies. And again, I sincerely believe that the solution lies in companies and investors which have this greater equity. And when I speak of equitable sharing of value in companies I am also referring to gender equality. We have launched a strategy in France in this area to bridge the unequal pay gap in my five-year term. We are taking the initiative with the World Economic Forum to introduce indicators and I think that it is very important to have more visibility in the area in the private sector and I would like to commend you for your very strong commitment to this issue. However I also think that we must collectively go further and I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau regarding the G7 and who decided to put this issue on the top of the G7's agenda as Canada will host this year's summit. I today reiterate that he can count on my full support.</p><p>If we also want to share value better, it must be done across all sectors. Taxation is a key issue that I briefly raised when I spoke about the challenges of the contemporary world. If we want to better share value and better share the financing of common goods in today's world, we must also have a much more coordinated tax strategy at global level. The \"race to the bottom\" means the end to the financing of common goods and any amount of sharing. That is where we have a great deal of collective work to do so as not to head in the wrong direction.</p><p>The OECD has done a massive amount of work on this issue which has enabled progress to be made on the base erosion and profit sharing (BEPS) initiative. We signed a multilateral convention and France has begun the ratification procedure. This is a key treaty and I strongly encourage the United States and China to sign it. It will not be effective if the United States and China are not involved. There is no real discourse on globalization if these two major powers are not taking part. Because it is a genuine partnership agreement on this issue to avoid base erosion. It is the decision we made to have a peaceful tax cooperation framework that prevents tax optimization strategies of groups and companies, and to promote morality, it has to be said, in the way profits are made.</p><p>I am very frank in saying that if you believe everything you have heard or the things you considered relevant or everything that you could have said in Davos, then you cannot continue to conduct tax optimization as it is being conducted today and you must join this fight. Because that would only mean that you consider that your sector, your business must finance common goods because we are in a world in which common goods need to be financed. And therefore we must renounce unbridled tax optimization and I hope that we can advance even further in this area.</p><p>There is obviously a second topic that is extremely important in the area of taxation, which is figuring out actual taxation globally of digital technology. Big tech companies are essential to our societies in terms of innovation and I have always welcomed them in France. Every one of us wants to have them in our countries and wants to develop them, so let's not be hypocrites. But at the same time, we are seeing a dual injustice. I cannot say to a start-up in my country that it is going to become a market leader when the big tech companies do not pay taxes in my country, and the start-up does. And I cannot say disruption or technological change is a good thing when these big tech companies create changes that I would like to support and make happen but they do not pay taxes. Yet the start-up they disrupt in its business model pays taxes, including VAT, corporate tax and so on. It is not a fair model; that is clear!</p><p>So we must end this unfair system and we must do it together so as not to reduce the competitiveness of any one country because of course, since we did not create a level playing field from the outset, we have created \"tax-attractive\" hubs. We must do this in a relaxed way, as it is a common good and because the major digital technology players cause disruption, this will destroy millions of jobs around the world, and we will have to retrain millions of people. Education is a common good, and as I said, it must be paid for. If those who are destroying jobs do not help fund this retraining, including to create jobs in their own sector, I don't know how you or I could explain this to the middle and working classes. So we must find the right tax cooperation framework, and I hope that we will find it in Europe this year, I hope that the OECD will find it this year and that we can achieve international cooperation on this absolutely essential issue.</p><p>Financial regulation</p><p>Achieving this cooperation and better sharing means regaining the vibrancy of our financial cooperation, and our trade cooperation as we did following the 2008 and 2010 crises and which we have since then somewhat lost. And I would like to make some proposals on this issue: I am in favour of the IMF having the mandate to monitor the entire international financial system, entire sections of which are currently unregulated. We built the IMF, it gained legitimacy, it monitors states and part of the financial system, but it does not monitor the most deregulated actors and those working hardest to bring about deregulation! Bitcoin, virtual currencies, shadow banking, the most aggressive players on the financial markets, the ones who can create financial crises and deregulate systems, we have said, \"They cannot be part of the IMF\".</p><p>We must discuss this issue, and I would like it to be discussed at the G20. I will see our Argentinian friend, President Macri, at the end of this week in Paris, and I know that he wants Argentina to provide strong G20 leadership, and the FSB has a crucial role to play in achieving this, and I want us to remain on this path to achieve increased regulation.</p><p>We must also look at regulation from the perspectives of the principles held by the main international digital technology and innovation actors. There is financial instability as I have just mentioned, but there is also instability in our societies linked to technological innovation. We do not currently have a framework to examine when we will decide to stop this innovation, as it will have to be done at some point. At what point will we say that artificial intelligence is a red line as it does not disrupt old production systems, but rather our relationship with individual freedoms and respect for privacy, because this undermines the integrity of humans and living things, there are philosophical issues and matters of principle which we must examine.</p><p>We must have the framework of international cooperation to limit this, to encourage technological innovation and help the major Internet platforms to continue developing our start-ups and innovation, but to be able to decide on the principles which cannot be decided by economic actors but by states. I want us to discuss this absolutely fundamental issue at the G20.</p><p>Social protection and climate</p><p>Finally, the last challenge is to protect, to protect socially, climatically and against terrorism. This is a duty if we want to remain in control of globalization and that also shows the importance of states in some of these challenges, and the return of states. For decades, we thought it very fashionable to say that states are finished, that private actors are the only way forward, but to rise to these challenges we do need states and international cooperation.</p><p>As regards social issues, we must buck this trend of unravelling our social legislation to adjust globalization and on that too, I would like us to have a discussion at the G20 so that the monitoring carried out by the IMF and major institutions, among others, would include monitoring national reforms for social cohesion, and so that support can also be provided on these issues, so that we in Europe look at social convergence when providing particular assistance to cohesion mechanisms, so that our mechanisms can have criteria for monitoring the social convergence between our countries. And we must stop the complete contradiction of saying this in international bodies, while sometimes asking countries, the same ones, to relax their social legislation to be able to make adjustments at suboptimal level and which does not provide the minimum protection which is fully required. And thus on social issues too, I want to restore the strong dialogue between the ILO and the IMF, and successfully set up such criteria.</p><p>We have discussed climate a lot and made many commitments, but out actions have not yet matched these commitments. I would like to commend China's strong commitment to continue to observe the Paris Agreement and to set up a carbon market, which is an essential part of our shared action in the area. This Forum was opened by Prime Minister Modi, and I would like to commend India's commitment to the International Solar Alliance; he has played a key role and this too is an essential part of the transition.</p><p>But we must now see actions which are in line with the Paris Agreement. What does that mean collectively? Firstly, the European Union must go a little further and decide on a floor price for CO2. If we cannot do this in the coming months, we will not be credible, we have set up a carbon market, we must speed up the transition for our actors and we must thus have a minimum CO2 price and change the production model in Europe to bring it in line with these commitments.</p><p>Secondly, I was in China a few weeks ago and was very impressed by President Xi's diplomatic initiative, which he presented to you last year, but this means that the entire One Belt One Road initiative must be in line with our climate commitments. These new silk roads must be green, they cannot be roads to the coal plant, they must be roads to renewables, to energies which reduce CO2 emissions, and we must all cooperate to uphold this commitment.</p><p>Thirdly, this means that we must continue to go further and by 2020, I would like us to be true players in a Global Compact for the Environment which would be a genuine legal watchdog for our companies and a tool for environmental justice for our citizens.</p><p>Finally, the private sector must play an active role in these commitments, 12 major initiatives were taken at the \"One Planet Summit\" in Paris on 12 December, and I hope we can monitor them regularly and that all investors, all major donors and companies which have made pledges can issue regular reports and demonstrate that the private sector is fully committed.</p><p>And the financial system must support this transition by fully promoting green finance. I think that finance is a good thing, as I have said, we are not financing innovation or its changes, but it must also finance a sustainable development model and Europe has a key role to play in this area, in the European Union and the Eurozone we must have a genuine green financial market capable of accelerating the funding of these transition models.</p><p>Terrorism</p><p>This duty to protect is a duty to provide security to our nations and citizens. As I conclude, I cannot, of course, bring up this essential issue without sharing a few convictions. The first is that we are and will remain enduringly committed to fighting terrorism. Our security forces are currently serving in a range of conflicts, whether against state powers, or against terrorists with varying levels of organization, in Africa, the Sahel and many other regions of the world. In this fight, we must continue working within our military and diplomatic coalitions, with clearly defined principles.</p><p>I want this fight to continue multilaterally, we cannot leave this framework which would be like acknowledging that the fight against terrorism must lead to the world being restructured and divided. We are combatting organized groups who want to destroy others but this must not justify dividing up our global environment. And maintaining multilateralism also means maintaining a strategy in which we put pressure on regional powers causing us concern such as Iran or North Korea, while never engaging in escalation or the division of certain regions.</p><p>Lastly, this fight must always take place in a diplomatic and political framework, because without a diplomatic and political solution to the fight against terrorism, terrorism will come back. We must be honest with ourselves; sometimes we have created situations which have led to terrorism by trying to unilaterally remove a tyrant because we did not wish to resolve all the problems. We cannot supplant citizens' sovereignty, assuage their frustrations, and sometimes their suffering, and so only stable, pluralistic, sustainable political solutions can strongly fight terrorism because they prevent these frustrations from returning in different countries.</p><p>And so our role, is not only to win the war against terrorism, but to put in place the conditions for sustainable peace in the regions of the world that are currently engaged in this fight. The Middle East and, of course, Africa, come to mind. Our cooperation is indispensable on these issues, as is our strategy for building peace because everything is interlinked and we must give back meaning to the globalization that we are supporting in these regions. This is where development policy and our diplomatic policy are inextricably linked to our military policy. If you work to fight terrorism in a country but you have no development strategy, no education strategy, you can make great progress and claim victory, but the causes which led to terrorism will still remain.</p><p>This applies to this entire global agenda. Terrorism came back in the Sahel because we did not step up to the plate on development, because we retreated on education, because we did not meet the challenges of climate change and the shrinking of Lake Chad, which has caused a genuine economic and moral crisis in the whole region. And it is the jihadists and their various associated groups that have provided the solution. And so you see, the fight against terrorism might be a military fight, a diplomatic fight, but it requires us to tackle all the challenges that I have just mentioned.</p><p>As you can appreciate, and I would like to finish with this, the core of the new global deal is not only to involve all stakeholders, but we must also be obsessed by fighting the free-rider strategy, which also requires us to be coherent in our approaches. We should no longer sign trade agreements with those who fail to respect out shared standards on the climate, health, tax and labour. We should stop discussing certain subjects with powers if they no longer fulfil our criteria. We should have a coherent agenda on public goods. This will not happen overnight but we should be honest about our incoherences something that we are progressively doing rather than continue on our diverging paths and enhance our incoherences.</p><p>This framework must be based on cooperation and multilateralism and must absolutely not be based on a new sort of hegemony, a fascination with new powers as this would be a huge mistake. We currently have a huge responsibility, because this new framework is the only way of protecting our interests, common goods and populations in the long-term. The answer can partly be found in this room and to a certain extent the new barriers are not technological or geographical barriers but rather our commitment, we are our own barriers in our own conscience.</p><p>If we commit to making globalization fairer, favourable to the middle classes, if we commit to taking into account the long-term complexity of our decisions and not just their short-term results we can come together and build a new globalization which is understandable and good for our citizens. Coming back to this great idea of progress, we, as governments, as businesses, have the solution but we must simply answer one question: do we decide to act, to forge ahead or not? Now is the time!</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Macron spoke in English and French.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p>But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p>Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p>Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p>And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p>Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p>FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p>And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p>What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p>FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p>He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p>So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p>FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p>FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p>Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p>In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p>And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p>On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p>Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p>So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p>Justice Thomas has more--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p>Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p>Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p>Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p>You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p>But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p>I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p>So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p>He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p>HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p>But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p>FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p>And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p>FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p>You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p>Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p>But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p>He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p>He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p>And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p>OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p>We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p>GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p>But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p>Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p>So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p>GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p>Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p>Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p>SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p>There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p>SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p>Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p>SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p>So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p>The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p>There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p>SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p>And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p>SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p>I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p>President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p>BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p>A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p>We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p>So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p>We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p>We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p>BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p>BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p>BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p>So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p>We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p>Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p>And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p>HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p>And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p>But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p>MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p> But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p> Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p> Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p> And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p> Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p> FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p> And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p> What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p> FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p> He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p> FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p> So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p> FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p> FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p> Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p> SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p> There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p> In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p> And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p> On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p> Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p> So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p> Justice Thomas has more--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p> Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p> Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p> Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p> You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p> But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p> I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p> FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p> So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p> He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p> HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p> But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p> FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p> And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p> FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p> MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p> You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p> MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p> Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p> But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p> He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p> He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p> And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p> OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p> We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p> LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p> GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p> But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p> Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p> So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p> GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p> Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p> Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p> ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p> SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p> There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p> SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p> Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p> SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p> So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p> The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p> SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p> There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p> SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p> And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p> SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p> SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p> I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p> President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p> BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p> A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p> We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p> So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p> We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p> We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p> BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p> BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p> So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p> BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p> So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p> We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p> Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p> And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p> HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p> And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p> But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p> MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered. President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE EVENING EDIT.</p><p>But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him. Edward, what's going on?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Actually, I want to tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M., Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going -- is on the list to be slated to close.</p><p>Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M. in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS: Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there. That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this.</p><p>Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO: She has said to us that she is willing to keep an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with the company going forward. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there. Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman, Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here?</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, I think what you see is poor timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very, very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p>And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment they had it before.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era.</p><p>Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for raising taxes.</p><p>FORBES: I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time. Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right.</p><p>And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p>What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of service, of civility and putting the country first.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. You make an important point because the strong American economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy, right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p>FORBES: Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say, defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more careful manner that was done subsequently.</p><p>He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in that area I think we could have used in more recent years.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your personal thoughts and memories of the president?</p><p>FORBES: Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me, expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds of gestures I think are what truly live.</p><p>So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of impression that never leaves you.</p><p>MACDONALD: And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve?</p><p>FORBES: There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful, wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda. You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The queen.</p><p>FORBES: He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a peaceable way that it did.</p><p>Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from 28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought it off.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see you, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's service?</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA: Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was really powerful.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right, senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\" to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN: Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he was so strong all the way through it.</p><p>In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It was really a beautiful moment.</p><p>MACDONALD: And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>HOEVEN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p>HOEVEN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN: Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on the world stage.</p><p>And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD: Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really appreciate it.</p><p>HOEVEN: Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel today.</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Two very opposite justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the liberals.</p><p>On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, he is.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages. And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know.</p><p>Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't know that he could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals. From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son.</p><p>So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy.</p><p>Justice Thomas has more--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era.</p><p>Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the regulators.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here. Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court.</p><p>FORBES: Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so, you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and but made a huge impact.</p><p>Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples of it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p>Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying, Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p>HOEVEN: Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush family it's amazing.</p><p>You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on the court.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD: What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p>But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him, both after he was out of office.</p><p>MACDONALD: Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and humility and integrity and service.</p><p>I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES: I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by the example he set.</p><p>So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So, it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the future--</p><p>MACDONALD: You know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD: Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me, Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First lady Laura Bush there.</p><p>He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p>HOEVEN: No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few 70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that enforcer role.</p><p>But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and they'll tell you the same thing.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p>MACDONALD: You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He's a very emotional guy.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see that in camera.</p><p>FORBES: And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes, George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help him mature into the great man he became.</p><p>And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the results are amazing.</p><p>MACDONALD: And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p>FORBES: And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p>MACDONALD: You are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p>MACDONALD: A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas.</p><p>You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there.</p><p>MACDONALD: He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD: Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p>Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator, you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right, senator?</p><p>HOEVEN: Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was.</p><p>But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again, it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women, there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve.</p><p>He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest baseball president.</p><p>He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s.</p><p>And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game, he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD: Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p>HOEVEN: Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service, loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p>MACDONALD: The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much, Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p>HOEVEN: Thank you.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800 points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break. We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off. That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p>OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again. The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p>We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT: Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p>GARBER: So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a lot of the world's population in China.</p><p>But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in China.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>GARBER: Those are the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD: And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again. I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p>Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p>GARBER: Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the application.</p><p>So there are different secretive agreements going on with android manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p>MACDONALD: Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say, then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p>GARBER: Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question. I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company. They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p>MACDONALD: So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things about you, or insurance companies.</p><p>GARBER: Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p>MACDONALD: You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p>GARBER: Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>GARBER: So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging behind.</p><p>MACDONALD: We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story for you as it develops.</p><p>Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p>Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL: Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p>SCALES: Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles. And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at this really since about 2011.</p><p>There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens his mouth, he is lying.</p><p>MACDONALD: So general, are you worried about this?</p><p>SCALES: No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an arms race.</p><p>Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to keep that treaty alive.</p><p>MACDONALD: Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p>SCALES: No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p>So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield, the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we should not be worried about it.</p><p>MACDONALD: General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network Huawei equipment.</p><p>The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p>SCALES: Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our technology.</p><p>There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p>MACDONALD: General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p>SCALES: Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p>And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20 years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p>SCALES: Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCALES: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone): Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear camp that you see recession?</p><p>LEE (via telephone): No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in 2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for -- looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p>I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that stocks will continue to go down.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are missing this point, Michael.</p><p>President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance, and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do you think?</p><p>LEE (via telephone): Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I swept in.</p><p>MACDONALD: You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p>BOLTON: Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in. Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p>A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p>We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas, have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact, actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p>So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p>We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there. It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>BOLTON: So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Not everyone. There are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GM: There is definitely opportunity for many of the workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing. That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a very difficult announcement to make.</p><p>We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right is on the workers.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p>BARRA: This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly changing transportation market.</p><p>LAWRENCE: What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of these plants?</p><p>BARRA: We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p>BARRA: You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.</p><p>So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p>We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job losses in their districts.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story. Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez, sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p>Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir, this is outrageous stuff.</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA: Liz, this is as bad as it gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country illegally?</p><p>And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way, undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make sure the communities are safe.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p>HODGSON: That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p>And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p>But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice system.</p><p>MACDONALD: If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you, Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018120501cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSKRWD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWW-S7S1-JB20-G3WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Evening Edit (formerly Risk &amp; Reward)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp; UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC3714 MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS &amp; ACCESSORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp; PASSENGER CAR BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George H.W.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p>But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p>Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p>Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p>And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p>Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p>FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p>And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p>What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p>FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p>He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p>So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p>FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p>FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p>Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p>In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p>And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p>On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p>Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p>So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p>Justice Thomas has more--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p>Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p>Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p>Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p>You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p>But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p>I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p>So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p>He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p>HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p>But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p>FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p>And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p>FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p>You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p>Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p>But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p>He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p>He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p>And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p>OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p>We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p>GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p>But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p>Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p>So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p>GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p>Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p>Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p>SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p>There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p>SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p>Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p>SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p>So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p>The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p>There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p>SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p>And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p>SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p>I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p>President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p>BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p>A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p>We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p>So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p>We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p>We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p>BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p>BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p>BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p>So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p>We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p>Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p>And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p>HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p>And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p>But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p>MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p> But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p> Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p> Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p> And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p> Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p> FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p> And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p> What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p> FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p> He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p> FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p> So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p> FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p> FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p> Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p> SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p> There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p> In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p> And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p> On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p> Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p> So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p> Justice Thomas has more--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p> Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p> Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p> Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p> You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p> But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p> I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p> FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p> So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p> He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p> HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p> But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p> FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p> And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p> FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p> MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p> You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p> MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p> Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p> But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p> He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p> He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p> And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p> OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p> We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p> LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p> GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p> But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p> Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p> So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p> GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p> Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p> Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p> ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p> SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p> There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p> SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p> Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p> SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p> So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p> The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p> SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p> There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p> SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p> And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p> SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p> SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p> I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p> President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p> BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p> A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p> We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p> So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p> We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p> We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p> BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p> BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p> So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p> BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p> So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p> We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p> Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p> And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p> HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p> And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p> But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p> MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p> But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p> Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p> Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p> And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p> Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p> FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p> And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p> What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p> FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p> He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p> FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p> So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p> FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p> FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p> Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p> SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p> There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p> In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p> And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p> On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p> Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p> So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p> Justice Thomas has more--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p> Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p> Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p> Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p> You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p> But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p> I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p> FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p> So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p> He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p> HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p> But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p> FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p> And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p> FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p> MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p> You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p> MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p> Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p> But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p> He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p> He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p> And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p> OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p> We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p> LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p> GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p> But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p> Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p> So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p> GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p> Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p> Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p> ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p> SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p> There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p> SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p> Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p> SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p> So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p> The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p> SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p> There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p> SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p> And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p> SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p> SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p> I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p> President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p> BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p> A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p> We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p> So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p> We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p> We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p> BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p> BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p> So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p> BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p> So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p> We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p> Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p> And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p> HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p> And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p> But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p> MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Edward, what's going on?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p>Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p>Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p>And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p>Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p>FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p>And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p>What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p>FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p>He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p>So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p>FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p>FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p>Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p>In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p>And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p>On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p>Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p>So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p>Justice Thomas has more--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p>Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p>Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p>Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p>You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p>But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p>I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p>So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p>He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p>HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p>But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p>FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p>And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p>FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p>You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p>Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p>But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p>He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p>He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p>And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p>OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p>We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p>GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p>But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p>Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p>So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p>GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p>Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p>Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p>SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p>There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p>SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p>Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p>SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p>So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p>The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p>There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p>SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p>And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p>SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p>I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p>President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p>BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p>A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p>We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p>So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p>We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p>We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p>BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p>BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p>BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p>So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p>We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p>Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p>And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p>HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p>And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p>But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p>MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p> But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p> Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p> Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p> And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p> Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p> FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p> And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p> What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p> FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p> He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p> FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p> So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p> MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p> FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p> FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p> Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p> SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p> There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p> In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p> And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p> Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p> On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p> Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p> MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p> So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p> Justice Thomas has more--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p> Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p> Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p> Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p> You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p> But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p> I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p> FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p> So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p> He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p> HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p> But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p> FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p> And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p> FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p> MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p> You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p> MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p> Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p> HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p> But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p> He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p> He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p> And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p> MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p> HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p> OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p> We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p> LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p> GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p> But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p> Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p> So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p> GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p> GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p> Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p> Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p> ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p> SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p> There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p> SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p> Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p> SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p> So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p> The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p> SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p> There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p> MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p> SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p> And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p> SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p> SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p> I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p> President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p> LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p> BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p> A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p> We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p> So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p> We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p> MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p> We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p> BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p> BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p> So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p> BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p> So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p> We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p> Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p> THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p> And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p> HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p> And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p> But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p> MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is a national day of mourning for our 41st President George  Herbert Walker Bush. The plane carrying his casket just now arriving at  Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a brief ceremony the motorcade will proceed to St. Martin's Episcopal  Church where family and friends will attend a private funeral service  tomorrow. This, after a moving state funeral held today at Washington  National Cathedral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of dignitaries, world leaders, five living presidents gathered.  President Bush was celebrated with praise and humor by close friends and  his son President George W. Bush broke down crying in an emotional address  filled with laughter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. This is THE  EVENING EDIT.</p><p>But first, we got breaking news. G.M. CEO Mary Barra running the gauntlet  in D.C. Congressmen demanding answers over G.M.'s decision to close plants  in the U.S. laying off 14,000 workers.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is in Washington with the latest, let's get right to him.  Edward, what's going on?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Actually, I want to  tell you right now, you are not seeing me because here is the CEO of G.M.,  Mary Barra, coming in for her next meeting. She's meeting with the  delegation from Maryland to talking about why the plant there is going --  is on the list to be slated to close. </p><p>Now she is on Capitol Hill today explaining the decision as to why G.M. has  to cut 15,000 jobs and close four plants in the United States. Now she met  senators from Ohio. She came, just came from a meeting with Ohio  congressmen and she needs -- so she needs to restructuring of this of G.M.  in order to make the company more viable and have it vibrant for the  future. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS:  Since 2009 we have invested $22 billion  in the United States. And in the last couple of years we've invested  several more billion dollars and we'll continue to do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And what's lost in this is there are 3,000 hourly workers who  will be able to move within the United States to some other plants there.  That still leaves 12,000 people that will be affected by this. </p><p>Now Senator Portman says that he asked Mary Barra to put new technology in  the plant at least in Ohio to try and bring that plant back to life and  save some of those jobs. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN, (R) OHIO:  She has said to us that she is willing to keep  an open mind, but does not want to raise expectations. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now after the meeting here, tomorrow Barra will meet with the  Michigan delegation in order to explain exactly what her thinking is with  the company going forward. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  That's real shoe leather journalism, Edward. Great stuff there.  Thank you so much for that report, sir. Let's get to Forbes Media chairman,  Steve Forbes joins me now. Steve, what's your take on G.M. here? </p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Well, I think what you see is poor  timing. I think they realize that now announcing this at Thanksgiving and  before Christmas. But the fact of the matter is the auto industry is very,  very competitive worldwide. People are not buying passenger cars the way  they used to, they like the SUVs, they like the trucks. But traditional  passenger cars, they don't so much.</p><p>And so, I think they probably made the right decision, but the timing of it  left something to be desired. But I do think in Lordstown they will do  something to keep that plant going even if it's nowhere near the employment  they had it before. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good point. Steve, let's turn to President George H.W. Bush's  funeral today in Washington, D.C. A World War II hero. A man of service and  integrity. He helped set the stage for the end of the Cold War era. </p><p>Here is the thing, Steve. You say that President Bush's policies also  helped set the stage for the economic boom of the 90s, but he's blamed for  raising taxes. </p><p>FORBES:  I thought the decision to raise taxes was the wrong at that time.  Still do. But he did other things, such as ending the Cold War, such as  dealing with the savings and loan crisis which cost a lot of money, it was  a huge strain on U.S. economy. So, he did a lot of things right. </p><p>And I think it's beginning to be appreciated today, his role in ending the  Cold War without a shot being fired. Because it went so smoothly, we think  that was the most of natural thing in the world. No. If he had mishandled  that it would have been a disaster. And that was an enormous achievement.</p><p>What he did with the Iraq war was an enormous achievement, and so he didn't  get credit at the time for those major achievements. But I think people  remember him today. And I think, Liz, in the future he's going to be even  more influential in death than he was in life by the example he set of  service, of civility and putting the country first. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. You make an important point because the strong American  economy equals to -- you know, is helped by a strong American policy,  right? In other words, you can't have a strong American economy if you  don't have strong foreign policies.</p><p>FORBES:  Security is essential. That's the first--</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- duty of a president or king or whatever. As they used to say,  defense of the realm. He was cognizant of that. He did cut back after the  end of the Cold War and the military but did so I think in a much more  careful manner that was done subsequently. </p><p>He was well aware from living through the 30s and 40s, you have to have a  good defense. Not too much, but certainly not too little. His leadership in  that area I think we could have used in more recent years. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve, you served under President George H.W. Bush as chair of  the bipartisan board for international broadcasting. Can you tell us your  personal thoughts and memories of the president? </p><p>FORBES:  Well, he was a president who cared about the country, but he also  is very personal. When my father died in early 1990, he called me,  expressed condolences, have said nice things about the meetings he had with  my father, he said things about what his father meant to him. Those kinds  of gestures I think are what truly live. </p><p>So, it was a privilege to serve him. He understood the importance of  communications and getting America's message out to the world. But he also  had that personal touch that really last with you and makes the kind of  impression that never leaves you. </p><p>MACDONALD:  And you could see his son's personal touch too, saying, you  know what, he had a horrible short game and he hated vegetables. That was  funny. There were funny moments today, right, Steve? </p><p>FORBES:  There were. It was a wonderful service as everyone has remark. The  two and a half hours went very, very quickly. It was a good combination of  humor and sadness. And I think what George W. Bush did was the perfect way  to end those extraordinary eulogies starting with Meacham, right, Simpsons  and the others, of Mulroney, Prime Minister Mulroney. A wonderful,  wonderful eulogies to an extraordinary man.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And Prince Charles representing her majesty the queen who  visited with George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush in 1991. And back then you  know, George H.W. Bush was poking fun at the queen. He said, Steve, at the  time, you know, you have your, you know, very competitive walking agenda.  You had our secret serviceman out of breath trying to keep up with you. The  queen. </p><p>FORBES:  He had that -- he had that personal touch. He could combine  seriousness of state with the humorous touches that make for personal  relations. And it was personal relations that help in the Cold War in a  peaceable way that it did. </p><p>Gorbachev learned to trust him. The former head of then declining Soviet  Union. He didn't lord it over him. He may practice the diplomacy in a way  that this thing could have gone as well as it could. And the idea 10 years  before if you'd said that if we're going to win the Cold War without a shot  being fired in the peaceful way that it was done, Germany would be reunited  as part of NATO and we'd wage a war in the Middle East with the allies from  28 other, 29 other nations, you would have said impossible. But he brought  it off. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Steve Forbes, chair of Forbes Media, great to see  you, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We are joined now by Republican North Dakota Senator John  Hoeven. It's great to see you, senator. Thanks for coming in. You attended  the funeral today. Can you tell us to what you remember most about today's  service?</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, (R) NORTH DAKOTA:  Liz, you know, it was remarkable. The  music was incredible. The military, not only the Marine Corps symphony, but  also the corps, (Inaudible) corps, the singers, but the presenters were  outstanding. But clearly, Bush 43's presentation I think incredibly  powerful, particularly when he said about his father. He was the finest  father a son could have and he choke up a little bit.</p><p>There wasn't a dry eye in the cathedral, there wasn't dry anywhere. It was  really powerful.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, we were covering it on set of Varney, Stuart Varney show  and we had tears in our eyes seeing President George W. Bush break down  like that and cry. You could see that he was trying to keep it in, right,  senator. That he was trying to hold back but when he said and got to the  point the last words that his father said in this world were \"I love you\"  to his son, that's when the tears started flowing, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Liz, exactly. You know, President Bush 43 is a strong man and he  showed it. You know, you could see he was going through the eulogy and he  want to do a good job for his dad. And you know, that final moment, and he  was so strong all the way through it. </p><p>In that final moment where he said, you know, he was the finest father a  son could have, and you know, he choked up at that point. It just that  resonated with people. It captured his father. It captured their love. It  was really a beautiful moment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And dignitaries from around the world were there. We were  talking just early about Prince Charles representing her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Also, Angela Merkel, King Hussein of Jordan.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And former British Prime Minister John Major, I mean, he was  respected around the world, right, sir?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that was one of his strengths, right? I mean, his  relationships with leaders around the world, and of course, look at his  resume before he was president. I mean, he was at the U.N., he was CIA  director. He was envoy to China. But that personal touch, I mean, I have a  letter from him, you know, which I treasure. And I mean, he reached out to  everybody and it was genuine and it was real and he certainly did that on  the world stage.</p><p>And I think there are leaders across the globe, you know, that still really  admire and appreciate George Herbert Walker Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, thank you so much for coming in, sir. We really  appreciate it.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Now what not many may realize is the huge impact President  George H.W. Bush had on the Supreme Court, a lasting effect we still feel  today. </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  You point out that he nominated two justices that paved the way for two  more.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Two very opposite  justices. One of whom greatly displeased him and one of them pleased him  beyond his wildest imagining. So, David Souter, a patrician Republican like  George W. Bush from New England turned out to be the darling of the  liberals. </p><p>On the side of abortion rights, on the side of expanding congressional  regulation of economic rights and famously or infamously on the side of  eminent domain whereby the government can seize property, and then sell it  to the higher bidder even if it's not going to be put to a public use. The  famous Kelo versus New London, Connecticut case. On the other hand, there's  Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. And is he the longest serving justice on the court right  now?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, he is.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He is the senior justice for 27 years. He has shocked even his  adversaries, and even his adversaries have praised his work. How do I know  this? So, when you teach law school, you use a casebook, about 1500 pages.  And it's the cases that first and second year law students need to know. </p><p>Flipping through the constitutional criminal procedure casebook and I see  opinions by Justice Clarence Thomas. And then I look at the author, the  editor of the casebook. Some of the most liberal intelligentsia in the  legal community showing respect for the work of Clarence Thomas. </p><p>MACDONALD:  So, he knew the guys to pick, right? I mean, you also point  out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know that he could--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  But John Roberts and Samuel Alito he appointed too.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, he appointed Mr. John Roberts to the circuit Court of  Appeals and he appointed Mr. Samuel Alito to the circuit Court of Appeals.  From each of which they ascended to the Supreme Court by his son. </p><p>So, I don't know that he could have expected that Justice Thomas would  serve as well and as long as he has. here's another little tidbit. This is  probably driving Justice Scalia in heaven crazy. </p><p>Justice Thomas has more--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Who you knew.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes. And I could him about this is he were here. Justice  Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas has more of his own clerks now as federal  judges and senior administrators in the nonpolitical appointee in the civil  service side of the government than any other justice in the modern era. </p><p>Acolytes of his small government, maximum individual liberty dial back the  regulators.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Steve Forbes and John Hoeven. Senator Hoeven is still here.  Steve, can you react to just what Judge Napolitano is saying about  President George H.W.'s impact on the Supreme Court. </p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think the judge has summarized it very well and Clarence  Thomas being on for as long as he has been, has had that influence. And the  fact is that the media just ignores what the impact that he has. And so,  you don't read in the public press much about him but he's had the kind of  impact that I think George H.W. Bush would've chuckle and appreciated  somebody who is a laid-back as the Thomas's as George H.W. Bush was, and  but made a huge impact.</p><p>Sometimes a less can be so much more. And there are those two are examples  of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, come in on this. What's your -- you were seeing  now the Bush family leaving the plane.</p><p>Can you react to what Steve Forbes and Judge Napolitano was just saying,  Senator Hoven about the impact in the Supreme Court?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely, I totally agree with him. And you know, it's  interesting to watch as a family comes off Air Force One. When I've  actually flown both President Bush 43 and Present Trump on Air Force One  and to see that magnificent aircraft carrying President Bush and the Bush  family it's amazing.</p><p>You know, but definitely no question that it's been a profound impact on  the court.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you have personal anecdotes, Judge Napolitano. You  met George H.W. Bush, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the George H.W. Bush that I met was after his  presidency. He twice teased me about my height, of course, almost everybody  is sure that President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What did he say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And listen to this. He was -- so Steve will love and so with  the senator. He was twice admonished by Barbara for it. And Barbara just to  him, you know, you all guys you think you're superior to people from  Princeton. Steve knows about this. They have an incredible superiority  complex. Totally undeserved.</p><p>But you know, it was the type of warmth you didn't expect from this  patrician. Everything everybody is saying about him about amiability and  kindness and warmth was what I observed in the two times that I met him,  both after he was out of office.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Forgive me, Steve for being a little -- I might be a little  arts here, but it gets breathtakingly tedious to hear conversations like  we've lost that demeanor and that positioning of just being of kindness and  humility and integrity and service. </p><p>I still think that there are people in this country who are like that. It's  not as if all -- everybody is talking like all is lost. D.C. is gone  forever into a pit of just terrible ways of behaving. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES:  I think by his example and the reminder that his death underlines  that example, those traits will live on. That's why his influence is going  to be perhaps even greater than it was when he was in the White House is by  the example he set. </p><p>So, it's out there. The American people has response to it today. I think  exemplifies the fact, underscores the fact that people like this kind of a  behavior, have like that kind of example of a service with humility. So,  it's there today, and I think you are going to see more of it in the  future--</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  -- because of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Senator Hoeven, you were there, you were at the funeral. I was  taken by biographer John Meacham recounting the president's love for his  life as George W. Bush exits with the first lady Barbara Bush -- excuse me,  Laura Bush who set an enduring example of elegance and stability. First  lady Laura Bush there.</p><p>He called, you know, he, George H.W. called Barbara the silver fox and when  the situation warranted the enforcer, so they're pretty honest about their  roles in the family, right, Senator Hoeven?</p><p>HOEVEN:  No question about it. You know, I run into quite a few couples  that are maybe married 50 years. Some that are married 60 years. Very few  70 over 70 years, and in their case 73 years. He called her Bar, the silver  fox or the enforcer. And it's humorous to hear him talk about her in that  enforcer role. </p><p>But listen to Bush 43 talk about her in that same capacity or Jeb and  they'll tell you the same thing. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. What did you think of this comment, I mean, there was a  lot of touching moments today at the funeral, right, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I thought it was deeply moving. I thought Meacham was  brilliant and Senator John Meacham was brilliant and Senator Meacham -- and  Senator Simpson was hilarious and George H. Bush made everybody's get  goosebumps when he wept the way he did.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You can still see George W. Bush in this live shot holding it  back. You could still see his struggle to keep the emotions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's a very emotional guy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he is. He's cried at the wounded soldiers.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  He cried at the opening of his library. And first, Steve  Forbes, first lady Laura Bush, you could visibly move today. You could see  that in camera.</p><p>FORBES:  And I think that's what added so much to the ceremony was, yes,  George H.W. Bush was president, but he was also a fantastic father and it's  no secret Bush 43, he had a very troubled time when he was younger. And it  was the understanding, firmness and understanding of his father that help  him mature into the great man he became.</p><p>And so, what it shows that you stick with it. That you will have these firm  principles but know how to apply them, know how to do it with love and the  results are amazing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And we also -- yes, go ahead, sir.</p><p>FORBES:  And the loss -- and the loss of a father like that we don't want  to get as you say treat you to idealistic, but that's the kind of model  that parent should look to. Having principles, firmness but also love and  understanding when the kids sometimes get into a rough spot.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  They'll get out of it with proper guidance.</p><p>MACDONALD:  A civilizing force of the first lady Laura Bush.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You are watching a live shot. Again, viewers, if you are just  joining us now of Ellington Field in Houston. The president's casket is now  with the honor service being -- exiting the carrier to come down to go to a  motorcade and then there will be a private funeral in Houston, Texas. </p><p>You know, every living president, five of them were there, Judge  Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And, you know--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And every vice president since 1970 was there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Except for George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, except Walter Mondale.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Even Walter Mondale. I think Mondale was there. </p><p>MACDONALD:  He attended Wednesday, sir, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, he did.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about the one when the  senator was at the Washington National Cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a moment to listen to the flourishes here. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Viewers, if you are joining us now, you are watching the  ceremony at Ellington Field as the casket of President George H.W. Bush has  arrived in Houston, Texas. It will head over to lie in repose at St.  Martin's Episcopal Church.</p><p>Let's get back to Senator John Hoven. You know, the point when, senator,  you were at the funeral today when George W. Bush as we're watching this  ceremony in Ellington Field, he said, George W. Bush is still clearly  trying to hold back tears, and so was the first lady. That moment when he  broke down it is so hard to watch somebody hold back their tears and then  break down when they read and an emotionally moving statement, right,  senator?</p><p>HOEVEN:  Absolutely. And you can see he's still, you know, struggling. It  became so apparent that as he made his wonderful presentation and it really  was fantastic that he was, you know, he wants to be very strong and he was. </p><p>But again, when he came to that special moment talking about how wonderful  -- what his father meant to him and he broke down for just a second. Again,  it was so emotionally powerful. Everybody could feel it. Men and women,  there was not a dry eye in the cathedral.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, I could understand that. And his three -- President George  H.W. Bush's three grandchildren. The three granddaughters were wonderful  today too, Steve Forbes, John Meacham, who eulogize also former first lady  Barbara Bush earlier this year. He was wonderfully funny, Steve. </p><p>He recalls, for example, a really funny anecdotes George H.W. Bush out on  the campaign trail, shaking hands with everybody accidentally shaking hands  with a department store mannequin in New Hampshire. And he said when he  realized his mistake George W. -- H.W. said, well, you'll never know, I got  to ask. It was a funny, funny moment.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes. And online more than one person observed in certain parts of  America they would be voters, so the humor out there in our great country  is still there even in a solemn moment like this. Another thing to keep in  mind, Liz, in all of this is that George H.W. Bush is also our greatest  baseball president. </p><p>He loved the game, play the game well when he was in college, Yale, he went  twice to the College World Series and he had amazing store of anecdotes and  the statistics about baseball. He was like, there's a great store in the  Boston Globe today by Dan Shaughnessy about George H.W. Bush's love of  baseball. How is like a little kid seeing a great baseball player like  Bobby Doerr of the Red Sox from the 1930s and 40s. </p><p>And that part of him again we didn't fully appreciate. But baseball has  been the national past time and this president appreciated it more and  understood it better than any other president. When he was watching a game,  he was recounted he would always be anticipating what the players would do  and he understood the glories of baseball, and that's just another feather  in an extraordinary cup of George H.W. Bush.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Final word, Senator Hoeven.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Well, that said, I mean he epitomize love of country, service,  loyalty, family, things that we all respect and honor and appreciate.</p><p>MACDONALD:  The nation says goodbye to George H.W. Bush. Thank you so much,  Senator Hoeven and Steve Forbes. I really appreciate your insights tonight.</p><p>HOEVEN:  Thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thanks for joining us. Let's get to the markets. Futures are  trading down 178 points right now after the massive selloff, nearly 800  points yesterday. We're going to have more on the markets after the break.  We've got a jampacked rest of the show for you. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, yesterday, we lost almost 800 points. The action in the  futures is not looking good right now. Nearly 200-point futures sell off.  That means nearly a thousand points in two days. We are staying on this for  you. Futures don't necessarily indicate what the markets will end at the  close of tomorrow's trading, but we're going to stay on it for you.</p><p>OK, let's get back to this story for you. Big tech behaving badly again.  The Washington Post slamming Google suggesting it is doing \"evil\" by  building a censored search engine for China that can spy on citizens. The  U.K., Britain, exposes even more Facebook controversies, fresh ones, in  another big reveal of internal documents.</p><p>We need one of the best cyber pros around to break it all down, Leeza  Garber. So, great to see you, Leeza.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, CYBERSECURITY EXPERT:  Hi, Liz. Great to see you and I'm  smiling, but this is not great news. It's not a good story.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, but Google -- take on Google first.</p><p>GARBER:  So Google really has been pivoting its position on China. At  first, it says way back in 2006, we are going to go in, we are going to  bring up the search engine, bring the internet to everybody. Not only is it  altruistic but there's a lot of money to be made in that market. There is a  lot of the world's population in China.</p><p>But at the same time, the Chinese government has some censorship issues and  then additionally, what is the Chinese government's role going to be and  how Google operates there? Are they going to have access to what citizens  are searching? Things like that. So there is a surveillance question as  well.</p><p>Google's CEO continues to take a different public position against what  Google employees are saying we should be in China, we shouldn't be in  China.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>GARBER:  Those are the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And so, you know, Google shut it down in 2006. The CEO, the  executive saying, hey, China is not only surveilling and spying but also  hacking into citizens' Gmails. (INAUDIBLE) but now they're doing it again.  I don't get that. Let's get to Facebook because this is a big story. The  U.K. had seized internal Facebook documents and e-mails and it found now  another big reveal that yes, Facebook was selling access to user data.</p><p>Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said we don't sell user data but it looks like  they're selling access. Even worse, according the to the e-mails, that it  build some kind of spyware, Facebook did, that could basically take out  (ph) your user data information without you knowing about it. And also  basically in android devices recording the history of who you are texting  and calling. That's what Facebook was doing.</p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is in the middle of a couple different significant  ethical issues right now. It is not just in terms of the consumers of the  application itself, but it's consumers of devices that house the  application.</p><p>So there are different secretive agreements going on with android  manufacturers, with different application developers in terms of what kind  of data they can garner from users of Facebook, if they're using an Android  phone, if they use different apps that are available.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Both Google and Facebook are free. That's what people will say,  then you say to yourself, OK, then users are the products, so maybe we  should be called suppliers and not users, right?</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. If it's free, you are the product. There is no question.  I mean , we are day by day giving up so much personal data that is so  valuable. And at the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company.  They are advertising to us 24/7.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So what's the limit to that? If you take the other side of that  argument, people saying, you know, you have this kind of benign kind of  aspect toward Facebook. You know, if you go to a medical clinic and medical  clinics, we hope, are not distributing your blood records, right, or things  about you, or insurance companies.</p><p>GARBER:  Exactly. It's a scary analogy because at one -- at some  perspective, Facebook is doing a valuable service. It is good. We get to  interact with people. There is a good there.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You're checking on your family and friends.</p><p>GARBER:  Right, exactly. Share photos and ideas. In that way, it is a great  platform. But on the other side, and this is something the United States is  struggling with, is the data privacy aspect. What is interesting about this  release of documents is it came from the U.K.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>GARBER:  So the E.U. has the new privacy regulations. The U.S. is lagging  behind.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We got to take a quick break. Stay right there. We are going to  have more on the show. Join us in the second.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's take a check at the futures. Look at this. It is  worsening. The futures are trending down 244 points to yesterday's drop in  the markets. That is over a thousand points. We are staying on that story  for you as it develops.</p><p>Let's get to the next case. Russian President Vladimir Putin warns the  United States that if it does walk out of the key Cold War arms treaty and  starts developing missiles banned by that treaty, that Russia will do the  same. This a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced that  Russia has 60 days to come clean about cheating under that treaty.</p><p>Let's take it up with Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Army Major General  Robert Scales. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, RETIRED U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So this treaty kept the peace for 30 years now. What is going  on? I mean, apparently the U.S. has intelligence that Russia has a nuclear  cruise missile that can hit Europe with little or no notice.</p><p>SCALES:  Well, actually, the Russian nuclear missile program comes in two  flavors. One is a rocket which exceeds the INF Treaty limit of 300 miles.  And the other issue, say, is a cruise missile. The Russians have been at  this really since about 2011.</p><p>There is no new news here. All 27 NATO nations agree that the Russians are  cheating just like they cheated in Ukraine, they cheated in Georgia, and  they lied about interfering with our elections in 2016. If Mr. Putin opens  his mouth, he is lying.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So general, are you worried about this?</p><p>SCALES:  No, not at all. A couple of quick points. First of all, Putin has  as you may have heard, has threatened that this may lead to a new nuclear  arms race. Well, that's impossible. Russia doesn't have the military  resources or the money to even begin to threaten the United States with an  arms race.</p><p>Secondly, the United States started its own refurbishment of its nuclear  programs and is well ahead of the Russians in that category. The third  thing, both sides have got 7,000 nuclear weapons. The last thing the world  needs is a brand newly minted Russian nuclear weapon. The INF is going to  die in about 60 days. There is very little that Vladimir Putin can do to  keep that treaty alive.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative  to conventional forces. Does that concern you?</p><p>SCALES:  No. A little military 101, Liz. Increasingly as we've seen over  the last 20 years or so, the battlefield is beginning to expand, whether  it's naval power, air power or land power. That's very much the case in  Europe. Now that the American military is focused increasingly on a peer  conflict with Russia, the battlefield has extended beyond the INF.</p><p>So whether it's a conventional rocket or a nuclear weapon, the battlefield,  the dynamics of war have grown beyond the treaty. The Russians understand  that and we understand it. The United States is already beginning to  develop artillery and rockets that go beyond -- at least rockets that go  beyond 300 miles. This is a normal evolution of the course of war and we  should not be worried about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, we're going to switch gear. Let's go to what is going  on with China and the trade deal. I hate to hit you with this, but China's  Huawei technology is again under fire. The United Kingdom's big  telecommunications company, BT, yanked out of its core of its network  Huawei equipment.</p><p>The trade deal clearly, the negotiations rocking the markets right now. The  futures indicating down another 240 points right there. Nearly a 1,000- point drop in two days. Investors are poring through and looking through  the China trade negotiations. Trump says one thing, the Chinese say  another. What's your take in all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, I have to say something. Frankly, the Chinese have never  been straight up about anything they do. As a soldier, I can tell you that  their approach to stealing our military secrets, I guess, is a legend, at  least within the Department of Defense. They do the same thing with our  technology.</p><p>There is very little that one can trust about the statistics on Chinese  business about their policies that deal with finance. They have always been  less than honest when dealing with the rest of the world. What's happening  now, Liz, is all of that is coming home to roost. Unfortunately, the  American investors are suffering in the short term.</p><p>MACDONALD:  General, is President Trump the right man to take them on?</p><p>SCALES:  Absolutely because no president in the last 20, 25 years has stood  up to the Chinese because they always believe that if China's markets can  open up, if they become entrepreneurial, that democracy will follow.</p><p>And I think you will agree with me, what's been proven over the last 20  years is that's not necessarily so. The Chinese have developed a way to  enrich their country. At the same time, remain a totalitarian state. And we  have to come to grips with that, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you optimistic we will get a deal with China?</p><p>SCALES:  Oh, I think so. First of all, it's more in China's best interest  to get a deal than it is in the United States' interest right now because  China has more to lose, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, that's a good point. It is in recessionary mode. Its  markets are in the bear market. Major General Scales, thank you so much for  joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Back to the futures, down more than 240 points after the Dow  lost almost 800 points yesterday. Let's bring in our money pro, Michael Lee  of Altium Wealth Management. He joins me now on phone. Michael, are you  worried? Are you going to be buying or selling tomorrow?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH MANAGEMENT (via telephone):   Liz, I will be looking to buy. I think we have two competing narratives  going on right now. I think they are both wrong. But they are dominating  the conversation. First is the FED will raise rates too high and too fast  and cause a recession. The second narrative is that the FED will stop  raising rates because growth is slowing so dramatically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is growth slowing dramatically? I mean, are you in the bear  camp that you see recession?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  No. I think a recession is years away. We obviously  will have a recession at some point in the future, but no time -- not in  2019 and most likely not in 2020. And people that are looking for --  looking to predict such an occurrence, there is no real evidence out there  other than what is going on in the media narrative.</p><p>I think volatility is here to stay. I think these two, one and a half, two  to three percent moves are coming but that doesn't necessarily mean that  stocks will continue to go down.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm sorry but -- I hear what you are saying. We came off in a  period of historic complacency, zero volatility last year, so one, two  percent historically moved, that is not a big deal. Are you optimistic the  president will get a trade deal? A lot of naysayers out there, they are  missing this point, Michael.</p><p>President Trump has aligned his legacy closely with the market performance,  and he will not allow that market to drop. He will grab that trade deal as  soon as he can, as soon as it is a good one for the United States. What do  you think?</p><p>LEE (via telephone):  Liz, in terms of trade with China, this is going to  be a long drawn out street fight. What we want will ultimately benefit  China and that's to open up their markets. They need the foreign investment  and they need to be a global trader. They can't have a closed economy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. I think -- is Deirdre Bolton ready to go again?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I swept in.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You did. Deirdre, what is going on 263 down?</p><p>BOLTON:  Two sixty-three down. So I think it is a lot of way you've been  talking about with your guests. That is to say there is a of traders in.  Liz, you were speaking with them too right yesterday in the sell-off. The  subtotal was what exactly happened in Buenos Aires? We know that this trade  tensions have this kind of 90-day window where they are frozen. But there  is a lot of investors who don't know what that means after.</p><p>A lot of people I am reaching out are saying we still don't know exactly  which industries are going to be affected or in which ways. Of course, we  heard this kind of silver lining possibilities, right?</p><p>We heard actually President Trump tweeting out earlier, referencing an  article that Bloomberg had written saying the Chinese have agreed to start  buying industrial products, have agreed to start buying liquid natural gas,  have agreed to start buying -- the implication was soybeans. In fact,  actually they didn't even name that precisely.</p><p>So it seems as if things are moving in the right direction but still no  precision. So I think that anxiety and those worries are what showed up for  the huge market day sell-off yesterday. It is what is affecting our futures  right now. We have a global sell-off too.</p><p>We know our markets of course are closed today in honor of former President  Bush but the rest of the world was trading. It was a rough day out there.  It was a rough day in Europe. It was a rough day in Asia. And I think a lot  of other countries, Liz, are looking at what is going on between us and  China. I mean, we are the world's two largest economies, right?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, if there does seem to be this kind of lack of precision and  vagary about what is coming in the next 90 days, all that means for people  is, they don't know what is happening again for the next three months, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's a good point. I mean, Deirdre, here is the other thing  that is going one. We got breaking news, Deirdre. Sit tight. Let's get  right to Edward Lawrence with an exclusive interview. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Not everyone. There  are a total of 15,000 basically the job cuts as you mentioned, but not  everyone is losing their job, right?</p><p>MARY BARRA, CEO, GM:  There is definitely opportunity for many of the  workers to work in other factories around the country that are growing.  That is our focus. We understand that it's a very difficult time. It's a  very difficult announcement to make.</p><p>We are really focused on making sure they understand the situation, they  know the options open to them, and that is where our focus is right now. I  really was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with many of the  representatives from Maryland to be able to understand their issues. We'll  move forward and make sure we stay in good connection, but our focus right  is on the workers.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Some people say the 21 percent tax is what the cut went to for  corporate tax, could use some of that money to save some of these jobs. Was  there one thing to you that said, you know, we have to make these changes?</p><p>BARRA:  This industry is transforming and we need to make sure that General  Motors is around for you the next several decades. We have responsibilities  to many of our stakeholders, our employees, folks who retired from the  company, our investors. And so we are trying to make sure that we have a  strong General Motors that is going to be ready and lead in a rapidly  changing transportation market.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  What about bringing new technology? Senator Portman talked about  bringing the new technology, electric cars, to possibly revive some of  these plants?</p><p>BARRA:  We build electric cars. I am very proud of the Chevrolet Bolt EV  that we built in Lake Orion, Michigan. It is doing very well. In fact, we  are expanding capacity there to build more of those vehicles. So, we are  bringing new technology. We also in that same plant build the test vehicles  for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>So, we are bringing new technology, that engineering work is developed  here. And over the last several years, we brought many of our engineering  jobs and many of our IT jobs back to the United States from many countries  around the world. It is something that we have invested in here.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Will you look at those plants? Moving some of those --</p><p>BARRA:  You know, we are going to work with our union. These plants are  unallocated right now. I have a responsibility to work the UAW on that.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I  appreciate your time.</p><p>So there you have it. Mary Barra leaving the meeting today with Maryland  delegation. Tomorrow, she is actually going to meet with the Michigan  delegation there. So a lot of news that lawmakers here are trying to get  her to possibly save some of these jobs, reallocate as you heard some of  the money and technology into some of these plants that might be closed.</p><p>We will just have to see how this all plays out. Again, this seems to have  united both Republicans and Democrats who obviously don't want to see job  losses in their districts.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, tough story. Ed Lawrence is giving breaking news on this  all day. Thank you so much, Edward Lawrence. Great reporting there. Let's  take a commercial break. We are going to be right back. Stay right there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're not going to believe this story.  Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker now calling for a state  judge to be temporarily removed. Why? She helped an illegal, Jose Perez,  sneak out the backdoor of a courthouse where federal ICE agents wanted to  arrest him in the front of the courthouse.</p><p>Let's bring in Bristol County, Massachusetts sheriff, Thomas Hodgson. Sir,  this  is outrageous stuff.</p><p>THOMAS HODGSON, SHERIFF, BRISTOL COUNTY, MA:  Liz, this is as bad as it  gets. You know, about a year and and a half ago, I testified before the  judiciary down in Washington before Congress. I remember Congressman King  asked me, Steve King said, sheriff, what should be done for these people  who are harboring and concealing people they know to be in the country  illegally?</p><p>And I said there's only one thing to do, congressman, issue arrest warrants  on them. Frankly, this judge and what she did, in a calculating way,  undermined not only law enforcement but undermined the people in the  community who trust her to do everything that she can as a judge to make  sure the communities are safe.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah, there is a grand jury probe to get to the bottom of the  allegations. He is a multiple offender. He was arrested and deported  multiple times for drug charges. We have heard judges obstructing justice  before. I do not understand how judges can get away with that, sheriff.</p><p>HODGSON:  That is the problem. Until we start really cracking down on  whether it is judges or whether it is elected officials, look, Title Eight  is clear. Anyone who attempts to harbor or conceal someone they know to be  in the country illegally commits a felony under federal law.</p><p>And so in this instance where this judge did this, what's worse about this  Liz, is that this individual was operating under three false  identifications, which is identity fraud, which is a felony.</p><p>But the judge was aware of this and then to know that the person to be  deported twice was operating under three different identifications and then  let them, bring them downstairs and out the backdoor and scale the fence to  get away, is completely outrageous. And to think a judge would do this  completely sort of undermines the confidence people have in our justice  system.</p><p>MACDONALD:  If it is true, they should throw the book at her. Thank you,  Sheriff Hodgson, and thank you for your service to our country. Well, we  had a jam-packed hour. A lot of news in the show. Thank you so much for  having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right  here on Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren and current Senator has just proposed to break up Google, alongside Amazon and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Proposed problem</p><p>According to Warren, the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets. She cites the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s as being responsible for the current crop of internet companies:</p><p>The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrivewhich pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services. Arent we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?</p><p>Warrens complaint is centered on Big Tech having too much power over the economy, society, and democracy. She is specifically referring to Google, Amazon, and Facebook today, and claims that they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. The plan also targets Apple and its iOS App Store, with more details at 9to5Mac.</p><p>Theyve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.</p><p>Her complaints on Google  Alphabet is not mentioned anywhere in the post  are as follows:</p><p>More than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook.</p><p>Googles history of Using Mergers to Limit Competition, specifically Waze and ad company DoubleClick</p><p>Google allegedly snuffed out a competing small search engine by demoting its content on its search algorithm, and it has favored its own restaurant ratings over those of Yelp.</p><p>According to Warren, this has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector. She cites:</p><p>The number of tech startups has slumped, there are fewer high-growth young firms typical of the tech industry, and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22% since 2012.</p><p>Proposed solutions</p><p>The 2020 candidates solutions are centered around how the ownership of a network and participating on the network cause[s] a conflict of interest. Warren is clear that she is against nationalization of industries  as American has chosen not to do in the past  but rather ensuring that networks do not abuse their power.</p><p>Warren wants to pass legislation that designates Google and other large tech platforms as Platform Utilities. Companies will then be broken apart from any participant on that platform.</p><p>Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as platform utilities.</p><p>These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.</p><p>This would be enforced by giving federal regulators, State Attorneys General, or injured private parties the right to sue a platform utility to enjoin any conduct that violates these requirements.</p><p>A company found to violate these requirements would also have to pay a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue.</p><p>Google Search and Googles ad exchange network would be classified as platform utilities, with the former spun off and the latter split apart. Additionally, Warren would reverse illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers, like Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.</p><p>Weve reach out to Google for comment on this policy proposal. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-139943286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-1121-JDJN-651H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple is not directly mentioned in Warren's post on Medium, but a representative from her campaign confirmed the plan would affect Apple. Image via CNBC and Scott Olson/Getty Images In essence, Warren wants to make \"big, structural changes\" to the technology sector in order to promote increased competition. The presidential candidate says that these companies have too much power \"over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" in the process hurting small businesses and stifling innovation.To combat this, Warren proposes a path to restoring competition to the tech sector in two major steps. </p><p>The first is by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as \"Platform Utilities\" and broken apart from any participant on that platform.This first step is what would directly affect Apple, as the App Store[3] would become a Platform Utility, and any of Apple's first-party apps on it would not be allowed. So, the company would have to choose between running the App Store or building and selling its own apps, according to Warren spokeswoman Saloni Sharma. The same law would hit Amazon on its Marketplace and Google's ad exchange.Second, the Warren administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing anti-competitive tech mergers. These include \"unwinding\" mergers like Amazon/Whole Foods/Zappos, Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram, and Google/Waze/Nest/DoubleClick.Warren argues that undoing these mergers would promote healthy competition in the market, putting pressure back on big tech companies that would make them more responsive to user concerns, particularly about privacy. \"Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy,\" says Warren.Toward the end of her blog post, Warren summed up her strategy: Here's what won't change: You'll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today. You'll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. You'll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.Here's what will change: Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants. Warren is among a dozen Democrats who have announced their runs for the 2020 presidential bid over the past few months, also including senator Kamala Harris, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, governor Jay Inslee, and senator Bernie Sanders. Confirmed Republican candidates running next year include president Donald Trump and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues[4] forum.

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at the garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif., appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who've espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to co-ordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the candidates' farthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p>Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters - both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p>The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 that left one woman dead organized their event with Facebook group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center found.</p><p>The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist - a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p>\"White supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\" said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written a book on the subject. \"The tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope - we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\"</p><p>And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to statistics compiled by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fuelled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \"replaced\" by minorities or foreigners.</p><p>Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, would go furthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p>Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - a provision that's been called \"the 26 words that created the internet.\"</p><p>O'Rourke's proposal would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don't set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits such as race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p>\"This is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\" O'Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p>Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it's questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy who wrote a book on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p>Kosseff said it's a legal issue that hasn't been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O'Rourke is proposing.</p><p>\"There are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\" such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \"But hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\"</p><p>Hate speech that isn't an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford's Center for internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \"A law can't just ban it. And Congress can't just tell platforms to ban it, either - that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\" she said.</p><p>Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube said it would remove videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p>But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just create new accounts after they're banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p>\"This isn't something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\" Kosseff said. \"The types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\"</p><p>The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p>To combat online extremism, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \"within the boundaries of internet companies' terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\" Buttigieg's plan states.</p><p>He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI's domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p>\"As an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I've seen firsthand what a concerted, co-ordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\" Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p>Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She'd also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \"a suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\"</p><p>And O'Rourke and former Housing secretary Julian Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p>The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues such as breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven't released specific plans on the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019090255504424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYM-X3D1-F103-313B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

That work would be \"within the boundaries of internet companies' terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\" Buttigieg's plan states.</p><p>He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI's domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p>\"As an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I've seen firsthand what a concerted, co-ordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\" Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have called for federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p>Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She'd also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \"a suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\"</p><p>And O'Rourke and former Housing secretary Julian Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has declined to join the pact.</p><p>The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates taking a hard line on Silicon Valley, with issues such as breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done. Warren has argued that splitting up Facebook and other large companies would force them to be more accountable for their content, a campaign spokesperson said.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a renewed focus by law enforcement on white nationalism, but haven't released specific plans on the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019090255504449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYM-X3D1-F103-313D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The man who massacred 51 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque streamed video of the attack live on Facebook. And the shooter who gunned down three people at Gilroy's garlic festival appeared to upload an Instagram post referencing a white nationalist author just hours before he opened fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the death toll rises from shootings carried out by people who've espoused white nationalist ideas, some Democratic presidential candidates are calling for social media companies to more forcefully crack down on hateful content on their platforms. Their goal is to make it harder for groups or individuals to coordinate their activities and circulate content targeting racial, ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the candidates' farthest-reaching proposals to stop extremists from weaponizing the internet have also sparked constitutional concerns over how far the government can go in policing online speech.</p><p>Social media has long been a crucial tool for extremist groups to disseminate their rhetoric and recruit new supporters - both on fringe right-wing platforms like 8chan and in dark corners of more mainstream networks.</p><p>The organizers of white nationalist protests in Charlottesville in August 2017 that left one woman dead <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/25/charlottesville-white-supremacists-big-tech-failure-remove\">organized their event</url> with Facebook group chats, as well as on the chat website Discord. And the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October had a history of sharing content and interacting with high-profile white nationalists on the right-wing social media network Gab in the year before his attack, an analysis by the  found.</p><p>The El Paso gunman cited the Christchurch massacre in a manifesto he posted online, while the Christchurch shooter, in turn, cited a 2011 mass murder in Norway carried out by an Islamophobic extremist - a sign of how one attack can inspire others in a deadly cycle.</p><p>\"White supremacists are using social media to connect and spread their hate and evil to others,\" said Farah Pandith, a former State Department official who focused on fighting violent extremism and has written  on the subject. \"The tech companies have been slow to act and limited in their scope - we have to be realistic about the importance and seriousness of this threat.\"</p><p>And it is a serious threat. Domestic right-wing terrorism is responsible for more deaths on U.S. soil since 9/11 than jihadism, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/what-threat-united-states-today/\">statistics compiled</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/11/01/gab-domestic-terrorist-robert-bowers-engaged-several-influential-alt-right-figures\">Southern Poverty Law Center</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Cutting-Edge-Entrepreneurs-Visionaries-ebook/dp/B01NGZL02Z\">a book</url> by the New America think tank. Experts say many of those attacks appear to be fueled by strands of the same racist ideology that white people are being \"replaced\" by minorities or foreigners.</p><p>Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, would go farthest of the presidential candidates in rethinking legal protections for social networks.</p><p>Currently, social media companies are insulated from lawsuits about content posted by users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">a provision</url> that's been called \"the 26 words that created the internet.\"</p><p>O'Rourke's <url normalizedValue=\"https://betoorourke.com/#plans\">proposal</url> would strip that legal immunity from large companies that don't set policies to block content that incites violence, intimidation, harassment, threats or defamation based on traits like race, sex or religion. And all internet companies could be held liable for knowingly promoting content that incites violence.</p><p>\"This is a matter of life and death, and tech executives have a moral obligation to play an active role in banning online activities that incite violence and acts of domestic terrorism,\" O'Rourke spokeswoman Aleigha Cavalier said in an email.</p><p>Most experts believe the First Amendment allows private companies to block content on their platforms. But it's questionable whether the government can tell social media companies what speech they should block and what they should allow, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the United States Naval Academy who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414\">wrote a book</url> on legal protections in the digital age.</p><p>Kosseff said it's a legal issue that hasn't been tested in the courts, and the outcome would depend on the exact language of the law O'Rourke is proposing.</p><p>\"There are certain types of speech that the government can regulate,\" such as imminent incitement of violence, or literal threats, he said. \"But hate speech standing alone is really tricky.\"</p><p>Hate speech that isn't an imminent threat is still protected by the Constitution, noted Daphne Keller, a researcher at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society and a former associate general counsel for Google. \"A law can't just ban it. And Congress can't just tell platforms to ban it, either - that use of government power would still violate the First Amendment,\" she said.</p><p>Many of the mainstream social giants already have voluntarily set terms of service that seek to block white nationalist content. Earlier this summer, YouTube<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/05/youtube-will-remove-more-white-supremacist-hoax-videos-greater-hate-speech-effort/\">said it would remove</url> videos that promote white nationalism and other forms of hate speech, as well as videos denying the Holocaust.</p><p>But putting those policies into effect can be tricky. Sometimes, white nationalists just <url normalizedValue=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-aug-27-2019?e=3acafc7aad\">create new accounts</url> after they're banned, forcing platforms to play a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p>\"This isn't something you can throw a bunch of A.I. at to fix,\" Kosseff said. \"The types of threats are evolving so rapidly.\"</p><p>The law protecting social media companies from lawsuits, Section 230, has already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">faced criticism</url> from both sides of the aisle in recent months, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Increased attention on how extremist thought spreads on the platform could give critics of the law more ammunition.</p><p>To combat online extremism, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is proposing the government work with social media companies to help them fight the spread of hateful ideology, such as providing federal funding to improve software tools to identify extremism. That work would be \"within the boundaries of internet companies' terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@buttigieg/an-action-plan-to-combat-the-national-threat-posed-by-hate-and-the-gun-lobby-5752a68c954e\">Buttigieg's plan</url> states.</p><p>He also wants to invest $1 billion to increase the FBI's domestic counterterrorism field staff and reverse Trump administration cuts to programs.</p><p>\"As an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I've seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat,\" Buttigieg wrote in his plan.</p><p>Meanwhile, both Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris have <url normalizedValue=\"https://kamalaharris.org/domestic-terrorism/\">called for</url> federal law enforcement to more actively monitor websites that are known as hotbeds of white nationalist thought.</p><p>Harris wants to expand the mandate of the National Counterterrorism Center to include domestic, white-nationalist terrorism, not just foreign threats. She'd also work to pass legislation letting courts temporarily take firearms away from \"a suspected terrorist or individual who may imminently perpetrate a hate crime.\"</p><p>And O'Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro have said the U.S. should sign on to the Christchurch Call for Action, a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The Trump administration has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/trump-administration-christchurch-call-to-action/index.html\">declined to join the pact.</url></p><p>The debate over online extremism is just the latest example of Democratic candidates <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/07/big-tech-democratic-presidential-race-2020-silicon-valley/\">taking a hard line</url> on Silicon Valley, with issues like breaking up big tech companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's championed that idea, says the growing influence of white supremacist groups on social media shows more needs to be done.

He has proposed giving every American $12,000 per year[1] to soften the blow of jobs lost to automation, and he has toyed with campaigning via hologram[2]. While these ideas have come out in bits and pieces[3], Yang officially revealed his comprehensive tech policy today. Yang's plan is a four-pronged approach. </p><p>It calls for treating data like property and establishing a Digital Bill of Rights, creating a Department of the Attention Economy to minimize the health impacts of modern tech, stopping the spread of misinformation, as well as a new approach to regulating tech companies.In a blog post[4] announcing his plans, Yang wrote:\"The advancement of technology in America has driven the advancement of humanity nationally and globally. But technology has also outpaced our government's understanding of it, and regulations are falling short of protecting us from Big Tech companies that are prioritizing profits over our well-being.\"Yang says personal data is the fastest growing industry in the US, and he believes citizens should have more control, like the ability to see how their data is being used and opt out if they choose. He wants to study the impact technology is having on \"kids' brains, socio-emotional states, and cognitive and physical development,\" and he's calling for accountability from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Regarding misinformation, Yang writes, \"We must address once and for all the publisher vs. platform grey area that tech companies have lived in for years.\"Yang also says breaking up tech giants, as Elizabeth Warren proposes[5], is the wrong approach. Instead, he says we need politicians who understand technology and a modern way to regulate[6] it.\"In order to regulate technology effectively, our government needs to understand it. It's embarrassing to see the ignorance some members of Congress display when talking about technology, and anyone who watched Congress question Mark Zuckerberg is well aware of this,\" Yang wrote in his blog post.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) shared personal stories and lessons from public service in an Executive Leadership Series event hosted by Stanford Women in Business .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moderated by SWIB President Tashrima Hossain '19, the discussion covered a range of topics, from Gillibrand's experience studying abroad in China to whether \"Big Tech\" should be subject to harsher anti-trust regulations. Gillibrand spoke most extensively about her conviction to empower women and the need to confront global challenges like climate change.</p><p>\"We need a solution as bold and big as the problem [we're] trying to address,\" Gillibrand said.</p><p>Reflecting on her journey in government, Gillibrand said that she was initially inspired by the strength and tenacity of female role models in her family to pursue a career in public service.</p><p>\"[They] really taught me that women's voices matter, that what you do with their time matters, that grassroot activism matters, that you have to dare to be different and that you shouldn't be afraid to do anything,\" Gillibrand said.</p><p>A Dartmouth and University of California, Los Angeles-educated lawyer, Gillibrand worked at private law firms before successfully running for the congressional seat in New York's 20th district in 2006. Gillibrand was re-elected in 2008 to serve a second term before being selected by Governor David Paterson to fill the senate seat left by Hillary Clinton, then nominee for Secretary of State.</p><p>Gillibrand said that global climate change is \"the greatest threat to humanity\" and voiced her support for the Green New Deal, an economic and environmental reform bill proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).</p><p>\"Green jobs are the greatest economic opportunity of this generation,\" Gillibrand said. \"[I would] use the bully pulpit of the presidency to generate nationwide, worldwide call to action and to be the one that figures it out.\"</p><p>In addition to her commitment to global issues, Gillibrand noted her determination to address gender inequality and determination to encourage women to participate more in politics.</p><p>\"We need more diverse voices in Washington because without them a lot of issues that are absolutely crucial won't even be raised,\" Gillibrand said. \"Until we have 51 percent women in Congress, the solutions and the experiences of women won't be well-represented.\"</p><p>Gillibrand also discussed her concern for privacy rights and election intervention by foreign entities through social media platforms, noting that she would study those issues to make sure \"our democracy is not for sale.\"</p><p>In her senate tenure, Gillibrand sponsored bills that addressed issues from sexual assault and paid family leave to healthcare for 9/11 first responders. She served an important role in the passage of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" Repeal Act, a policy that allowed LGBT individuals to serve openly in the military.</p><p>Gillibrand announced on Jan. 16 that she would launch an exploratory committee for president in \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and officially joined the 2020 presidential race on March 17, claiming that she would make \"big, bold, brave choices\" if elected. Gillibrand said that her motivation for service comes from the stories she heard about issues that impact people's lives.</p><p>\"Every issue that I've ever taken up, there is a constituent who is desperate for someone to fight for them,\" Gillibrand said. \"I was inspired to lift up their voice and make a difference.\"</p><p>As one of the 23 Democrats running for president, Gillibrand highlighted her electoral victories in a traditionally conservative district and her leadership in Congress as proof that she can succeed in the primary election and \"bring the country together.\"</p><p>\"I know that as president I can represent all of America, listen to everyone regardless of where they live and find the common ground necessary for progress,\" Gillibrand said.</p><p>Ana Clara Martins '21, SWIB's vice president, said after the event that the organization invited Gillibrand because her inspiring presence as a woman in politics represents the values SWIB hopes to embody. Similarly inspired by Gillibrand's strength and charisma, Kevia McComb '22 also praised Gillibrand's ability to appeal to the college audience.</p><p>At the end, Gillibrand summarized the lessons she learned from life and career and encouraged students to pursue their goals.</p><p>\"Believe in yourself, don't wait and just do what you dream of,\" Gillibrand said.</p><p>Contact Daniel Yang at danieljy 'at' stanford.edu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4190581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-4021-DY7P-T162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Stanford Daily: Stanford University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Stanford</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TA3</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

'That's one reason why Tulsi has been a vocal proponent of breaking up the tech monopolies.'</p><p>'[I]f Google can do this to Tulsi, a combat veteran and four term Congresswoman who is running for the nation's highest office, Google can do this to any candidate, from any party, running for any office in the United States,' the statement continued. </p><p>The lawsuit also alleged that Gabbard's campaign emails were being placed in the spam folder in Google's email server, Gmail, at 'a disproportionately high rate' compared to the other more than two dozen candidates.</p><p>The lawsuit, which is believed to be the first time a presidential candidate has sued a major technology firm, is seeking an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages to her campaign of at least $50 million.</p><p>Although no other campaigns have alleged Google has suspended their advertising accounts, the tech company said it has an automated system that flags unusual activity related to advertisers accounts.</p><p>A spokesperson for Google, Jose Castaneda, told The New York Times that this practice is to help prevent fraud.</p><p>'In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter,' he said of Gabbard's advertising account. 'We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.'</p><p>The unusual activity detected was likely due to the spike in visitors searching for the Hawaii lawmaker after the debate</p><p>The 38-year-old lawmaker still regularly polls at less than 1 per cent among likely Democratic voters, even after the first round of debates.</p><p>The boost was also reflected in her popularity that night - a poll on popular aggregation site The Drudge Report showed viewers thought she won the night. Nearly 40 per cent said Gabbard was the winner and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who usually polls as No. 3, was in second place for the night.</p><p>The first debate night was largely seen as the B Team since front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were not on stage.</p><p>Gabbard, who was the youngest woman ever to become a U.S. representative, only spoke for 6.6 minutes during the debate, but remained relatively calm and concise, and it was enough to get her name out there.</p><p>Gabbard also was the first Hindu member of Congress. </p><p>Google and other tech companies, like Facebook, are receiving increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators over their influence in political debates and elections. </p><p>'Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,' Ms. Gabbard said in a statement. 'This is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.'</p><p>Gabbard's criticism of the tech company reflects similar complaints made in Republican circles who claim their voices have been stifled on the internet, and especially on social media sites.</p><p>She has support from those in both political parties, likely due to her wariness of big tech, which Republican and Democratic voters alike can relate to.</p><p>'Big Tech's dominance represents a clear and present danger to our democracy,' Gabbard's campaign sent in its email to supporters on the lawsuit. 'That's why Tulsi is fighting back, and has filed a lawsuit against Google in federal court.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-54771346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-G1M1-JCJY-G3S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><timeReceived>6:56 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Pelosi steadfastly did not call for impeachment, though she promised that President Trump would be fully investigated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Read the wrap-up of the convention by CALmatters' Ben Christopher by clicking here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California: More than an ATM</p><p> Fourteen presidential hopefuls made their way to the Bay Area.</p><p> The Bay Area, always an ATM for national candidates, became a place for retail politics for 14 Democratic presidential hopefuls this weekend, thanks to legislation approved two years ago that moved this state's presidential primary up to March 3.</p><p> * Because of early voting, Californians will be able to cast votes on the day the Iowa caucus takes place.</p><p> Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, along with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and many more, addressed the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, and spent some or all of the weekend at rallies, fundraisers and the occasional press gaggle.</p><p> * CALmatters' Ben Christopher and Elizabeth Castillo, who spent the weekend in the wilds of Moscone Center, offer their take in this handy slide show.</p><p> Frontrunner Joe Biden was the notable no-show. He was speaking about LGBT rights at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Columbus, Ohio, where he was introduced by Chad Griffin, the organization's president, a former Clinton administration official.</p><p> * Meanwhile: Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis, the Obama administration's first Labor Secretary, endorsed Biden.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Advertisement</p><p> FSB Core Strategies: Public Affairs.

Cory Booker did call for better care for mentally ill people.</p><p> Sure, there were references to the border and immigration but nothing about the potential impact on California if, for example, Trump follows through on imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico.</p><p> * Sen. Kamala Harris got applause for her call to start impeachment proceedings against Trump. The state's former attorney general made no mention of police use of force, but recently detailed a housing plan in Iowa.</p><p> * Booker wove his personal story, including his Stanford education, with topics of the day, including the slaughter of 12 people in Virginia, but didn't mention California's role in gun control.</p><p> * Elizabeth Warren probably gave the best performance, with her plans for this and that and her calls to break up big ag, big banks and big tech.</p><p> * Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, mired near the bottom of the polls, talked about his tour of Paradise, and deftly tied his call to combat climate change with the need for blue collar jobs, including having the United Auto Workers build electric cars in Michigan.</p><p> Why not point to California?

Kamala Harris spoke Saturday about gender pay equity at a MoveOn event near the convention center, a man stepped onto the stage, took Harris' microphone and began mansplaining palaver related to animal rights.</p><p> Video of the scene shows moderator Karine Jean-Pierre stepping between Harris and the man, and others\u2014including Harris' fierce husband, Doug Elmoff\u2014muscling him off the stage.</p><p> * Harris, unharmed, returned to complete her remarks.</p><p> * In a sign of the times, the guy was not arrested, and made himself available for media interviews outside the convention center, which is named for Mayor George Moscone, who was assassinated in his City Hall office in 1978.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Advertisement</p><p> ------------</p><p> New Democratic leader</p><p> Rusty Hicks in the blue blazer</p><p> Los Angeles labor leader Rusty Hicks was elected California Democratic Party chair, marking the second time the party rejected insurgent candidate Kimberly Ellis, CALmatters' Ben Christopher and Elizabeth Castillo report.</p><p> * Ellis won the endorsement of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat.</p><p> * Hicks won endorsements that mattered, including elected California Democrats and organized labor.</p><p> Hicks is the president of Los Angeles Federation of Labor, a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserves and an alum of Barack Obama's presidential campaign.</p><p> * Hicks will be in charge of what matters most to party insiders: managing the Democratic Party apparatus and raising money all in the service of electing Democratic candidates.</p><p> Money matters: Hicks takes over the California Democratic Party when it's flush. It had $11.8 million in the bank as of mid-May, to the California Republican Party's $343,000.</p><p> Blue collar workers</p><p> Building trades members at the California Democratic Party convention.</p><p> The California Democratic Party has shunned campaign donations from oil companies.</p><p> On Saturday, Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, like several other Democratic presidential candidates, signed pledges that they would take no \"fossil fuel\" campaign money.</p><p> * But the Democratic Party and its candidates welcome campaign help from the oil industry's blue collar workers, represented by unions that are part of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California.</p><p> * The building trades council illustrated that point at the party's convention in San Francisco by wearing t-shirts with the slogan: \"We built this party.\"</p><p> Noting that President Trump won votes of many blue collar workers in 2016, Robbie Hunter, head of the council, told me: \"This [Democratic] party isn't talking about working people's issues.\"</p><p> In Sacramento, oil industry lobbyists and the trades council are allied on issues, including opposing a ban on fracking, any new bans on oil drilling, and air emission standards that might force refineries to shut.</p><p> * Money matters: The building trades donated $1.4 million to the California Democratic Party and county parties in the 2017-18 election cycle, and $100,000 to the state party in May and in April.</p><p> To go deeper, read this piece by Politico's Carla Marinucci and Debra Kahn.</p><p> High stakes in emissions fight</p><p> Unrelenting commutes. Lost construction jobs. A statewide economic shudder. Prepare for all three if California loses its clean air battle with the Trump administration, CALmatters environment reporter Rachel Becker writes.</p><p> * All that could be collateral damage as California battles the Trump administration over the feds' attempt to roll back Obama-era fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for vehicles. Trump's ultimate leverage: money.</p><p> * There are a lot of ifs, but in a worst-case scenario, roughly 2,000 projects totaling $130 billion could be affected.</p><p> Chris Schmidt, of CalTrans: \"The ramifications are pretty dire.\"</p><p> A question for Trump: Is he willing to undermine transportation in a state whose ports account for 40% of all goods coming into the United States?</p><p> Commentary at CALmatters</p><p> Mark Arax, author of \"The Dreamt Land: Chasing water and dust across California\": We Californians grabbed nothing less than the edge of a continent, 1,000 miles in length. Highest mountain, lowest desert, longest coast, most epic valley, riparian forest, redwood forest, wetland, grassland and inland sea. The rain fell 125 inches a year in one place and seven inches a year in the other place.

But is his long to-do list realistic?  We have a reality check.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're also checking a claim that has quickly gone viral.  Does President Barack Obama really have the lowest spending level of any president in more than half-a-century?  Republicans sure don't think so.  Well, we're crunching the numbers for you.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a woman lies in a hospital brutally beaten.  Police suspect her husband, a prominent scientist.  But he says he was out of town at the time and she doesn't remember a thing.  We're digging deeper.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Wolf Blitzer.  You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.  </p><p>Mitt Romney's latest campaign ads are full of pledges about what he'd do on day one of his presidency, but our reality check shows he'd have to wake up extra, extra early on January 20 to start on that to-do list.  It's a long list.  </p><p>Our national political correspondent, Jim Acosta, is joining us.  </p><p>Here's the question, Jim.  Can Mitt Romney really do all he says he would do on day one?  </p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that certainly is the question, Wolf.  According to his new ads, Mitt Romney is going to be a busy man on his first full day in the White House and he may need the full 24 hours to get through all of his day one promises.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NARRATOR:  What would a Romney presidency be like?  </p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over):  In his latest TV ad, Mitt Romney lays out an ambitious agenda for his first day in office.</p><p>NARRATOR:  President Romney stands up to China on trade and demands they play by the rules.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  It's actually Romney's second day one ad.  Add up all of the promises in both ads, and a President Romney would not only confront China on trade, but seek deficit cuts and some business regulations, approve the Keystone pipeline, push for tax cuts and... NARRATOR:  President Romney issues an order to begin replacing Obamacare with commonsense health care reform.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  That's such a big to-do list, one presidential historian says the Romney White House might want to start loading up on caffeine.  </p><p>LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS:  I don't think coffee would be enough, probably a full carton of NoDoz. I can't imagine that they actually believe that he could accomplish all of this within the first 24 hours in office.  He could begin the process of doing this, but that is all.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So help me God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congratulations, Mr. President.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>ACOSTA:  Traditionally on day one, presidents are busy, but with the inauguration, the parades, the parties.  In his first full day on the job, the most significant thing President Obama did was order pay freezes for White House staff.  </p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So help me God.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congratulations.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>ACOSTA:  President Bush on his first full day signed an executive order banning tax dollars from going to international family planning groups that promote abortion.  </p><p>One former aide to President Nixon told CNN that White House staff couldn't find the presidential pens.  It can be like the first day at school.  These days, it seems both the Romney and Obama campaigns are trying out different messages.  On education, Romney made the case to a Philadelphia charter school that smaller class sizes don't equal better performance.  </p><p>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have 351 cities and towns.  I said let's compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students because we test our kids and we will see if there was a relationship.  And there was not.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  He got an earful on that from teachers in the room.  </p><p>STEVE MORRIS, TEACHER:  I can't think of any teacher in the whole time I have been teaching, over 10 years, 13 years, who would say that they would -- more students would benefit them.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  Before the president made his trip to Iowa, his new Web video hits Romney for what he said in the state last year.  </p><p>ROMNEY:  Corporations are people, my friend.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  And he's modifying those attacks on Romney's business career by connecting it to Bush.  </p><p>OBAMA:  Why is he running around with the same bad ideas that brought our economy to collapse this last time out?  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>ACOSTA:  Romney said there's a reason why the president is attacking his career.  </p><p>ROMNEY:  There's no question but that he's attacking capitalism.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ACOSTA:  Now, speaking of trying out new things, get this.  Mitt Romney says, if you donate money to his campaign, you will be entered into a contest to win a dinner with him and Donald Trump.  </p><p>Take a look at this.  The winner gets a ride from the airport in the Trump vehicle, a night in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a tour of the boardroom on the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" set and dinner of course with Romney and the Donald.  </p><p>Wolf, take that, George Clooney.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Well, it sounds -- yes, sounds like he's going to the president's playbook, because the president has a similar raffle.  You could go to dinner with George Clooney and the president, that huge fund-raiser they had out in Hollywood a few weeks ago.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  That's right.  </p><p>BLITZER:  So it looks like they're trying to use some of the same gimmicks.  </p><p>ACOSTA:  They're pulling out the heavy artillery, Wolf.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Yes, Donald Trump, George Clooney.  What do you think?  </p><p>ACOSTA:  That's right.  It's hard to pick.  Maybe Gloria could tell us who she'd pick, who she would have dinner with.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Well, let's bring in Gloria.  She's here right now, our chief political analyst.</p><p>BLITZER:  Donald Trump, George Clooney.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER:  I think I know your answer.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) BLITZER:  Let's move on.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, I think you know my answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BLITZER:  Let's talk about these promises.  Day one, Mitt Romney, he has got a long list of things he's going to do.  </p><p>BORGER:  Right.  He's not going to sleep much.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Some people say that's sort of dangerous, risky to make all those promises if he's elected.  </p><p>BORGER:  This is just a P.R. device.  And let's not take it literally.</p><p>What he's saying is these are the things I want to do because he wants to make very clear to the American people how he differs from Barack Obama.  But should he decide to actually issue executive orders on day one, which he probably would, he should look back to what happened to president-elect Obama.  </p><p>Remember, president-elect Obama, first thing -- one of the first things he did was restrict access of lobbyists to the White House, close that revolving door.  Well, eventually, he had to make some exceptions for people he wanted to put into his administration.  Also, as you know very well know, Wolf, the closing of Guantanamo Bay by executive order, seems to me Congress had a different idea and that still has not occurred.  </p><p>So this can boomerang for you.  And some people are still saying to the president, you promised that on day one.  What happened?  </p><p>BLITZER:  Yes.  It didn't exactly work out, some of those commitments.</p><p>BORGER:  Exactly.  </p><p>BLITZER:  It could happen again if -- and it's a huge if -- if Romney is elected.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER:  That's right, but Congress always, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, Congress believes it actually has something to say in these matters.  </p><p>BLITZER:  It's an equal branch of government, I believe.  </p><p>BORGER:  Right.  </p><p>BLITZER:  That's what we have all learned.  </p><p>All right, look at these new polls that just came out today, the NBC News/Marist polls in battleground states, three of the most important, if not the most important right now.</p><p>BORGER:  Right.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Ohio has President Obama at 48 percent, Romney 42 percent. Let's go to Virginia.  Look at this, Obama 48 percent, 44 percent. Florida, key battleground state obviously, right now in this poll, 48 percent for Obama, 44 percent for Romney.</p><p>In all of these polls, 3 percent sampling error.  Is it too early, though...</p><p>BORGER:  It is.</p><p>BLITZER:  And I think the answer is yes -- for the president and his supporters to start celebrating?</p><p>BORGER:  You know, asked and answered.  </p><p>For example, there was another recent poll taken at about almost the same time in the really important state of Florida.  Take a look at this, Quinnipiac University, and you see the registered voters here, there is a six-point difference in favor of Mitt Romney.  So the pollsters can argue about their samples and which poll is more accurate and which is more heavily weighted towards Democrats or Republicans.  </p><p>But here's one thing to keep in mind about these three states we're talking about today, that, actually, Mitt Romney needs to win them all if he's going to have a clear path to 270 electoral votes.  So that's Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.  </p><p>President Obama, on the other hand, has lots of different ways to get to 270 because he's got more support in the West that he's going to try and draw on, like in the state of Colorado, maybe even in the state of Arizona, certainly New Mexico.  </p><p>So he probably has to win one of these three states, but Mitt Romney really needs to have a trifecta here if he's going to have a path.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Yes.  I think, in my own sense, based on history, based on what I suspect is going on, the president will have the most difficult times in Florida and in Virginia.  </p><p>BORGER:  Right.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Ohio, I think he has a little bit better chance because he helped salvage the auto industry, and there are so many auto-related jobs in Ohio that might work well for him.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER:  And Virginia is also obviously another very tough battleground which the president won last time around.  He wants to keep it in his corner.  The Republicans believe they have got a lot of hope there. And, by the way, they believe they have a lot of hope in the state of Florida.  What if, for example, Jeb Bush were on the ticket with Mitt Romney?  That might help him out.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Yes.  I think it -- I'm sure it would help him not only in Florida, but it would help him with Hispanics in other states as well. </p><p>BORGER:  That's right.  That's right.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Gloria, thanks very much.  </p><p>Let's go to Jack right now.  He's got \"The Cafferty File\" -- Jack.  </p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR:  Right about now, Wolf, Democrats are probably wishing they hadn't picked North Carolina as the site for this summer's convention. </p><p>When President Obama selected Charlotte, North Carolina, more than a year ago, it seemed like a smart way to double down on the state that propelled him to victory in 2008. </p><p>North Carolina hadn't gone to the Democrats since Jimmy Carter. </p><p>But things have gone downhill and quickly in the Tar Heel State, and the list of problems seems pretty long. </p><p>For example, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage at about the same time that President Obama was saying he thinks it's a good idea. </p><p>Now gay rights activists want the convention moved out of North Carolina -- practically impossible to do at this point. </p><p>Unemployment in the Tar Heel State, 9.4 percent, far above the national average. </p><p>Plus, who dreamed this up?

Fire breaks out less than a hundred feet from the reactor while the vessel is docked just a few dozen miles from a major city.</p><p>And does President Obama really have the lowest spending record of any president in more than half-a-century?  We're checking a claim that's quickly gone viral.  </p><p>Plus, he works at a conservative think tank, but he's blaming Republicans for the dysfunction here in Washington.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BLITZER:  A fire rages for a dozen hours aboard a nuclear-powered submarine, sending thick smoke over the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine.  Seven people were injured in the blaze.  </p><p>Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us with the details.</p><p>Chris, how dangerous could this have been?</p><p>CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, if it had gone into a different part of the ship, this could have been dangerous indeed because this particular sub is powered by a nuclear reactor. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE (voice-over):  The submarine's crew couldn't stop it alone. Neither could the shipyard fire department.  So the fire kept burning, less than a few hundred feet from a nuclear reactor onboard and more than 60 miles from Boston.  The USS Miami was docked for repairs with no torpedoes or weapons onboard. </p><p>REAR ADM. RICK BRECKENRIDGE, U.S. NAVY, SUBMARINE GROUP COMMANDER: There's still nuclear fuel on board in the reactor.  But the reactor is in a complete shutdown condition.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Subs like this are divided into two watertight compartments.  The fire started in the forward area where most of the crew lives and that part had to be evacuated.  The after compartment houses the nuclear reactor and propulsion team.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE:  They did not need to evacuate the ship.  They were able to maintain their watch stations in the propulsion plan.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Imagine working in a three-story building that's only 30 feet wide.  No windows, 80 percent of it crammed full of machinery. Now, imagine fighting a fire in those conditions.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE:  The temperature is very high, caustic fumes and smoke- filled compartment.  Heroes respond to those kind of situations to save the ship. </p><p>LAWRENCE:  There was a skeleton crew onboard.  Experts say if the fire ignited out at see, the full crew could have put it out faster.  If the fire started out in the nuclear reactor area, the real danger would have come from radiation exposure, not an explosion.</p><p>JOHN PIKE, GLOBALSECURITY.ORG:  These submarine reactors have very high enrichment levels, nearly bomb grade, but not too bomb grade.  So close doesn't count each even though they have highly enriched cores, much higher than, say Iran is enriching and they're not quite to bomb level and so you're not going to get a detonation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  So under normal conditions, a crew member onboard a sub is exposed to radiation like we are just walking outside in the sun, but all of the crew members do have these radiation detectors on them that periodically are checked just to make sure they aren't receiving too much radiation.  I spoke to a former sub commander who says he's never heard of a fire burning that long 12 hours out at sea like this one did in port.</p><p>He told me flat-out, Wolf, the crew wouldn't last that long. </p><p>BLITZER:  Very scary.  Do we know how this fire started?</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Still under investigation.  They had to vent out the ship basically in order to let the teams get in there to investigate that. </p><p>BLITZER:  I'm sure there will be a full investigation in this one. Lessons learned hopefully.  Thanks very much, Chris Lawrence. </p><p>An unlikely ally coming to the aide of cargo ships attacked by pirates.

And it's not clear if Mr. Clinton knew the woman or if he was aware of their profession.</p><p>That is going to cause a little bit of a buzz on the Internet, I imagine, Wolf.  People take pictures.

We're checking a new claim that he's got the lowest spending record in more than half a century. </p><p>And is the GOP to blame for the dysfunction in Washington?

But does he really have the lowest -- the lowest spending record of any president in more than half a century?</p><p>Our Mary Snow has been digging into the claim that's now gone viral.</p><p>Mary, what have you learned?</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, as you just mentioned, this claim is that the president has overseen the lowest growth in federal spending in 60 years.  The White House quickly embraced it, but critics say the math isn't as cut and dry as it's made out to be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW (voice-over):  On the campaign trail, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney often targets the president's spending.</p><p>The president is now firing back with this.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  My opponent won't admit it, but, you know, it's been starting to appear in places, you know, real liberal outlets like \"The Wall Street Journal,\" since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.</p><p>SNOW:  What's behind the president's comments is an editorial for CBS Market Watch which has an affiliation with \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Its title, \"The Obama spending binge never happened.\"</p><p>Obama supporters seized on it and it went viral, taking aim at Romney's spending claims.  PolitiFact fact-checked the spending claim circulating on social media, it compared presidents and found spending under Obama grew 1.4 percent annually when it looked at raw dollars. It gave a mostly true rating to the claim that under Obama, there was the slowest federal spending in six decades, putting him second to President Eisenhower. </p><p>LOU JACOBSON, POLITIFACT:  There are other factors you can look which are not as flattering to the president.  Debt has gone up quite significantly over the same period of time, and then federal spending at the percentage of the gross domestic product is higher now than it has been under most of the recent presidents.</p><p>SNOW:  But critics call the numbers fuzzy math.  Brian Darling of the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation says it ties too much spending in 2009 to President Bush and he says it gives a false impression of spending levels under President Obama.</p><p>BRIAN DARLING, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  Well, the bottom line is if you take 2009 years and attribute it to Bush rather than President Obama who is responsible for the spending -- most of the spending in 2009, it does make it look like he's restrained spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW:  Now, to be clear, the original analysis did account for $140 billion in spending in 2009, transferring from President Bush's spending to President Obama's spending.  But the critics are saying, look, basically, that doesn't go far enough -- Wolf. </p><p>BLITZER:  The debate will continue.  Thanks very much.</p><p>They're a pair of veteran scholars from a liberal think tank and one from a conservative think tank, and they've sent out shock waves when they said the Republicans are mostly to blame for the gridlock and the dysfunction in Washington. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER:  And Norm Ornstein is joining us now from New York.  He's the co-author with Tom Mann of a brand new book entitled, \"It's Even Worse Than It Looks\".  It's a powerful new book, I highly recommend it.</p><p>But, Norm, let's talk about what you say because I was pretty surprised to hear your bottom line.  Let me read a couple of lines that you and Tom wrote in \"The Washington Post\" recently. </p><p>\"We've been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional.  In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believe it was warranted.  Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party.  The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics.  It is ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise and unmoved by conventional understanding of facts and evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of the political opposition.\"</p><p>I read that, Norm, and I said, wow, that's pretty strong stuff from you.  Give us a sentence or two why you say that?</p><p>NORM ORNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS\":  You know, it wasn't an easy thing for us to say, Wolf, because we've tried to be impeccable.  We call them as we see them, but we believe the problems of the country such as they are and after 32 years of being immersed in politics from Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, that what we now have is imbalance.  We have parliamentary parties, but we have one party that's gone towards the edge of the process enough that it's more concerned with blocking anything done by the Democrats and the incumbent than in trying to find compromise and work toward solutions.</p><p>And no better example of this than what Richard Mourdock, the man who knocked off Dick Lugar, no moderate, a real conservative, but a problem solver, in Indiana just last week.</p><p>BLITZER:  He obviously says he doesn't want to compromise.  He wants to hold firm.</p><p>ORNSTEIN:  Yes.</p><p>BLITZER:  But you basically blame a lot of the problems right now in two individuals, Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist.</p><p>ORNSTEIN:  Yes, and I think there's a lot of blame to go around.  Let me add that it's not like there are any angels here.  Neither party is blameless, but it's an 80/20 mix now, and some of it goes back to what Newt did to break the stranglehold the Democrats had on the House of Representatives which lasted for 40 years.  It took him 16 years but it was -- we've got to destroy this institution in order to save it. And along the way, it engendered a lot of the tribal politics that we have now.</p><p>Marry that to the pledge -- the Grover Norquist pledge that 95 percent or more of Republicans in the House and Senate signed -- you can't solve our debt problem as Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, the \"Gang of Six\" in the Senate, every group that's looked at this that's tried to span the ideological spectrum has said, must include some revenues. If you say, my way or the highway, not a dime in revenues. </p><p>BLITZER:  Listen to what Republican Congressman Allen West of Florida said last month.  This obviously a favorite of the Tea Party.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLA.:  I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  Yes.  In case our viewers didn't hear that, \"I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.\"  Now he's not backing away from that at all, but that was pretty shocking, A, but what was even more shocking to you -- and you point this out.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Yes, and it basically is, you get statements like that and you know there are people who say outrageous things in many cases but not a single member of the Republican leadership or establishment from the Speaker of the House to the Republican candidate for president condemned what was Joe McCarthy reincarnated here.  </p><p>It was an outrageous thing to say.  It's still a smear to call somebody a member of the Communist Party and that -- you didn't have anyone standing up here, tells us that even those people who would like to presumably solve problems or move to the center right, which is where the Republican Party had been, are just not going to step up when you get extreme things said.  </p><p>And of course, the fact that West isn't backing down at all also tells us that there's no sense of shame anymore in making outrageous statements, you double down.  And that's no way to reach some kind of common ground or collaborate on policies and to solve problems that are not going to be done unless you find that common ground.</p><p>BLITZER:  Well, it's been the reaction, I curious, over at the American Enterprise Institute, you've been affiliated with them for a long time.  It's a conservative think tank here in Washington.  What are your colleagues saying to you?</p><p>ORNSTEIN:  Well, you know, some of my colleagues are not happy and some have written rejoinders but mostly, everybody has been very supportive, whether they agree or disagree, they're happy that Tom and I have done a book that is grabbing a lot of attention and selling a lot of copies.  </p><p>And so I've always been left alone to do and think and say whatever I want, whether people like it or not.   And you know, look, let's face it, Wolf, a part of this is Tom, who's at Brookings, and I built a lot of capital over more than 40 years of studying this, being straight shooters and now we spent capital doing something and saying something that's pretty controversial and we'll draw some lines that a lot of people aren't going to like because we felt it was time and necessary to do it.</p><p>The book is entitled, It's Even Worse Than It Looks.\"  The author, co- author, I should say, Norm Ornstein; the other author, Tom Mann. Norm, thanks very much.</p><p>Thank you, Wolf.  It's always a pleasure.</p><p>The chairman of the Democratic National Committee is criticizing, yes, criticizing the Obama administration for allowing the daughter of the Cuban leader Raul Castro to attend a conference in San Francisco.  And wait until you hear what Mariela Castro now says about President Obama.  Stand by.  We're going to talk about that.  U.S.-Cuba relations in our \"Strategy Session.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  </p><p>There's stuff happening in U.S.-Cuban relations that I want to discuss in today's \"Strategy Session.\"  Joining us right now, the democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile and the Republican strategist and CNN political contributor Alex Castellanos.  </p><p>And the reason I want to discuss it with both of you, U.S.-Cuba relations, you were there about a year ago.  You met with Alan gross, the American prisoner who's held.  They spent about two hours with him.</p><p>Alex, you're a Cuban-American.  You've studied this issue for a long time, so you both have interests.</p><p>Now the Obama administration granted a visa to a whole bunch of Cubans, Cuban Communists, to go to a conference for gay rights in San Francisco, including the daughter of the president, Raul Castro, Mariela Castro.  Listen to what Senator Marco Rubio told CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLA.:  It was a mistake because she's not just a citizen of Cuba or a visitor from Cuba.  She's an agent of the Castro government.  She is a propaganda agent of, an enemy of the United States and an anti-American regime, coming to the United States to spread her propaganda here.  And that's the first.  </p><p>And the second is she's an agent of a government that is a state sponsor of terrorism.  So for these reasons, I've joined in a bipartisan protest to the granting of that visa.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER:  Was it was a mistake to grant her a visa, Donna, to come to the United States?  </p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION:  No, this is her second trip to the United States.  She was here about 10 years ago. No, I don't believe it was a mistake.  Look, I believe in freedom of expression, I believe a part of our principles as Americans, that we allow people to travel freely.  </p><p>She's been here before.  I met with her along with many other American officials to talk about her work on HIV/AIDS and prevention, sex education.  She's an interesting person.  She doesn't work for the government.  Her father is the president of the country.  I think there's nothing wrong with the exchange --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER:  She was granted a visa during the Bush administration when the president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the secretary of state was Colin Powell.  So Donna's correct.  This isn't the first time that the daughter of Raul Castro was invited -- given a visa to come to the United States.</p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, Republican STRATEGIST:  And that should have been the last time.  Everybody in Cuba works for the government, by the way.  That's all there is.  No, you don't -- you legitimize something. You take tyranny and you make it appear normal.  </p><p>Her job is to come over here and appear that -- like she's one of us, that she shares the same interests and concerns and we can't take that at face value, of course, because they are a very different country, where they imprison people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER:  (Inaudible).  Donna, you're disagreeing not only with Alex Castellanos, who is a good Republican, with -- not only with Reince Priebus, who is the chairman of the Republican Party, but you're also disagreeing with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the congresswoman from Florida, who is also the chair of the DNC, the Democratic National Committee and Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator who is running for re-election from Florida.  They agree this was a bad idea.</p><p>BRAZILE:  I don't think they'll expel me from the Democratic Party because I hold opposing views.</p><p>BLITZER:  Pretty unusual, though, for the chair of the DNC to be critical of the president's -- the Obama administration's decision.</p><p>BRAZILE:  You know --</p><p>CASTELLANOS:   (Inaudible).</p><p>BRAZILE:  Debbie is from Florida and I --</p><p>BLITZER:  So she did it for political (inaudible)?   BRAZILE:  I had my deal (inaudible) Gonzalez and the situation when with I was Al Gore's campaign manager.  I understand Florida politics. I understand Cuban politics.  We've had 50 years of this embargo -- 50 years.  And you know what?  We have to get rid of this Cold War mentality.  Cuba is changing.  </p><p>Look, I did not go there to appease.  I met with the cardinal.  I met with dissidents.  I met with Cuban officials and I met with Alan gross.  So I wasn't going there as a propaganda machine.  I was going there to find out what's going on 90 miles from our border.</p><p>BLITZER:  All right, go ahead, Alex.</p><p>CASTELLANOS:   Look, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has the courage to do the right thing when it's politically popular in her home state.  Sure it's politics, but it is the right thing to do.  And as far as the embargo in Cuba, there are two sides of that issue.  </p><p>There are a lot of folks, Wolf, who think that the most powerful weapon we have is freedom and free trade, and that's a good argument, until you get to the point, well, then, do you then sell stoves to Hitler?  Do you do trade with a tyrant who is going to use the benefits of that economic trade to oppress his people?  </p><p>BLITZER:  Will playing nice with the daughter of Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, and others help free Alan Gross, the American citizen?  It's two and a half years he's been stuck in Cuba right now for bringing some computers, some laptops, banned equipment to help this tiny Jewish community in Havana right now.  Is this going to help?  You've spent some time with him.  He's been in jail now for two and a half years.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Alan Gross should be freed.  Alan Gross should be let go on humanitarian grounds.  I think he's served much longer.  We have freed other USAID workers from other parts of the world.  He should be freed as well.  </p><p>You know, it's interesting.  The same equipment that he was accused of bringing into Cuba to spy, I pretty much had it in my purse.  I had my laptop, I had my iPad, you know, I had my camcorder.</p><p>CASTELLANOS:   You're lucky you're here.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Well, because, you know, come on.  But it's clear to me that this is an atrocity.  Alan has suffered a great deal.  He's lost over 100 pounds.  I met with his wife, Judy.  I met with his lawyers, Peter (ph).  But let's go back to this Castro thing.  The country is changing.  I hope to go back there one day.  The country is changing. The Cuban government is --</p><p>BLITZER:  I think that my own sense is if they released Alan gross that would help your position right now because it could lead to an improved relationship the U.S. and Cuba.</p><p>And listen to what Mariela Castro, the daughter of Raul Castro, the niece of Fidel Castro was quoted in \"The Miami Herald\" today, saying at this conference in San Francisco where she is right now, she's quoted as saying, \"I would vote for President Obama.  </p><p>I think he's sincere and speaks from the heart,\" to which the Romney campaign put out a statement, \"President Obama should disavow the endorsement of the daughter of the Cuban dictator, Raul Castro.  It is galling that an envoy from a Communist regime would come to our country and lecture the American people on who to vote for while the regime refuses to hold free and fair elections and systematically violates the human rights of its people.\"</p><p>CASTELLANOS:   You know, some Republicans are going to go nuts with something like this and say, see, I told you Obama was that far to the left.  Of course, it has nothing to do with that.  But it does tell you something about weakness.  </p><p>There is so little respect for this president that people feel they can push him around.  That's one reason the Cubans are hanging on to Alan Gross.  They're using him as a bargaining chip to try to get the Cuban Five out.  People try to infiltrate our military bases.  They respect strength.  They don't see it here.</p><p>BLITZER:  We're going to continue.  We got to leave it there, but we're going to continue this conversation --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE:  (Inaudible) change taking place.</p><p>BLITZER:  We're going to watch what's going on and stay on top of it. I got that letter not that long ago from the Cuban interest section here in Washington at the embassy in Switzerland, and they make their case why Alan Gross deserves to be in jail, but there's -- they outline some options maybe for changing (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASTELLANOS:   If you put in Spanish, you'd be El Lobo.</p><p>BLITZER:  El Lobo.  OK, guys, thanks very much.</p><p>We're going to update you on the mysterious case of a prominent marine biologist who remains a suspect in the brutal beating of his wife, even though she swears he was not involved.  Stand by.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are trading jabs about the debt crisis.  CNN's Erin Burnett is joining us. </p><p>Erin, I know you've been closely following this battle over the debt and what's called sequestration, these across-the-board cuts that would hurt both Democratic and Republican interests.  </p><p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told \"Politico\" this -- and let me put it up on the screen -- \"I am not going to back off the sequestration, that's the law we passed.  We did it because it wouldn't make things easy for us.  It made it so we would have to do something.\"</p><p>Erin, what is going on here?  </p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST:  All right.  Well, you could look at this two ways.  One, it's a line in the sand that is sure to really upset Republicans, Wolf.  As you know, they are trying to say, look, this $1.2 trillion in cuts, we want to prevent some of the defense cuts and instead take more money from social services.  That's what they've been pushing to do.  </p><p>But I have to say Harry Reid, hero of the day for saying, no.  The whole point of these cuts is they would be nasty for everybody.  If we can't do a grand bargain, let's go through with them exactly as they're scheduled.  </p><p>So it's a line in the sand sure to upset Republicans but it seems like the right thing to do, and it sort of goes along with what John Boehner told me last week, which was sure to upset Democrats, but it's also the right thing to do.  Here's that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  It took me eight months to get people interested in  actually talking about fixing the problem.  So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT:  (Inaudible).</p><p>BOEHNER:  Let's start now.  Why are we going to wait until after the election?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT:  He's talking, of course, about the debt ceiling, Wolf, and saying, hey, you know what?  I'm not going wait.  I'm not going to wait.  We got sequestration, we got unemployment benefits going away, Bush tax cuts going away, all of this going away after the election. You really think a lame duck session is going to do the great bargain America needs?  No.  </p><p>So he is also right.  Tonight we'll talk about this, Wolf, and actually talk about the fact that the debt problem of which we are also acutely aware could be so much worse that anyone of us actually realize, to the tune of more than four times worse and $66 trillion. I'm going to explain why tonight on \"OUT FRONT.\" </p><p>BLITZER:  7:00 pm Eastern, I'll be watching.  You're getting me nervous just hearing what you're saying, Erin, but I'm interested. You've got my curiosity, thanks very much.</p><p>BURNETT:  All right.</p><p>BLITZER:  A prominent scientist suspected in the brutal beating of his wife, but he says he was out of town at the time, and she doesn't remember a thing.  Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Jack's back with \"The Cafferty File.\"  Jack?</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The question this hour, Wolf, is was it a mistake for the Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention?  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but a lot of stuff has changed down there, including that constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage.  </p><p>Bobby writes, \"Hard to say but with politics almost anything can change the dynamics of the game at any time.  I don't know if it was a mistake, but I seriously doubt it was an accident.\"</p><p>Paul writes from North Carolina, \"Jack, you should know better.  There are a lot of intelligent, progressive people in my adopted home state, but a Tea Party-infested legislature elected in 2010 slipped the gay marriage amendment onto the ballot to appease their hardcore religious right base.  Having the convention here is the right thing to do, because it confronts the wing nuts on their home turf.  And when the thoughtful, sensible voters come out in November, the result will look a lot like it did in 2008.'' Kimmy writes from Salisbury, North Carolina, \"As you can see, I live in North Carolina and I don't want any political convention in my area.  Personally, I think any party, Democrat or Republican, should choose a state where they are loved.  We don't love Democrats.\"</p><p>Augusto in Los Angeles, \"Hi, Jack.  I enjoy reading your blog.

Thank you.</p><p>A mysterious assault here in Washington, D.C.  So why did authorities bar a man from his wife's hospital room?  Stand by.           </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  A Washington woman brutally beaten within an inch of her life.  Her husband a marine biologist, renowned in his field, now a prime suspect.  More than a month after it happened, it's an investigation with more questions than answers.  Lisa Sylvester has been investigating.  </p><p>What are you finding out?  </p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, this is absolutely terrifying.  Imagine being in your own home, being savagely beaten and having no memory of it.  That's the case for one Washington woman. And police are looking into whether her husband was involved.  But he tells CNN he would have never done this to his wife.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over):  The victim:  Svetlana Guggenheim, a beautiful Russian translator who lies in a Washington hospital recovering from a brutal beating.  The suspect:  her husband of 18 years.  David Guggenheim is a prominent marine biologist who has been featured on \"60 Minutes.\"  </p><p>Detectives executed a search warrant and confiscated his phone, computer hard drives, Internet router and other items at his home late Tuesday.  But in this interview with CNN, he insists he had nothing to do with her assault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SYLVESTER:  Did you have anything to do with it?  Could you have harmed your wife in any way?  </p><p>DAVID GUGGENHEIM, MARINE BIOLOGIST:  No, never.  And there is no history of that.  I would never hit her or anyone else.  And we have a very peaceful marriage.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over):  David says he and his wife were on separate business trips.  Svetlana returned home on April 4th.  She sent him this text message, thanking him for keeping the house clean.  </p><p>Her adult daughter spoke to her on the phone the next day, April 5th. David said he called his wife on April 5th, but there was no answer. He showed us the frantic text messages he sent her over the next two days.  </p><p>SYLVESTER:  Worried, he cut his trip short and came back here to their Washington, D.C., apartment and what he found shocked him.  It was his wife, lying on the floor wearing only a blouse, her head and face badly beaten.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM:  There was a lot of dried blood on the floor, dried blood in her hair.  She had an awful black eye, her left eye.  She was shaking and semiconscious.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over):  Svetlana was rushed to the hospital.  David remained by her side while she was in intensive care with no memory of what happened.  He stayed with her until April 19th.  That's when police officers told him he was barred from the hospital.  For a month he had no access to her and was prevented from getting updates from doctors.  David was under a cloud of suspicion.  </p><p>CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explains why.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  If this was an assault, the lack of evidence of false entry certainly suggests that it was someone she knew and a husband, frankly, is always going to be a lead suspect.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over):  And the metro police department said there was a note in Svetlana's hospital file, in which she allegedly told a nurse her husband was involved with her beating.  According to court records, quote, \"It is Ms. Guggenheim's explicit wishes that plaintiff not be permitted to have contact with her.\"</p><p>But David Guggenheim says that note has inconsistencies, including two different dates.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM:  I was with her on the 19th.  She was in no condition to give any sort of statement on the 19th or before the 19th.  I'm very suspicious of this memo.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over):  He thinks someone fabricated that memo.  The metro police department and the district attorney's office declined to talk to CNN, citing the ongoing investigation.  </p><p>Svetlana Guggenheim has since sworn in an affidavit her husband was not responsible and has no memory ever telling anyone that her husband was involved.  </p><p>David has provided CNN with receipts from his trip to Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey during the timeframe when his wife was attacked.  Train receipts, one from a Wal-Mart and a Starbucks.  He remains a suspect, but is now allowed to see her in the hospital.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM:  Being able to see her now is -- I mean, it's -- I can't even express to you how emotional it is to be able to see her and care for her.</p><p>SYLVESTER:  David Guggenheim has not been charged, but he hasn't been cleared, either.  Their apartment has surveillance videos which the police now have, but they are not releasing these tapes, Wolf?  </p><p>BLITZER:  How is she doing?  </p><p>SYLVESTER:  She's actually recovering.  I mean, she's doing fairly well.  They still don't know if she has any vision in her left eye.  I mean, she had some significant head injuries.  She had surgery, but they were able to reduce and there was some brain swelling, some brain bleeding, they were able to address that.</p><p>So she is well.  She is talking.  Still not walking yet.  So she has had a long road to recovery.  She's been in the hospital six weeks already, Wolf, so. BLITZER:  Yes.  Let's hope for the best.</p><p>All right, stay on top of it for us.</p><p>Thank you, Lisa.</p><p>[Byline: Gloria Borger, Jim Acosta, Wolf Blitzer, Chris Lawrence, Lisa Sylvester, Mary Snow] [Guest: Norm Ornstein] [High: How does President Obama's spending record measure up?

What do you think?</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right. It's hard to pick. Maybe Gloria could tell us who she'd pick, who she would have dinner with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Well, let's bring in Gloria. She's here right now, our chief political analyst.</p><p>BLITZER: Donald Trump, George Clooney.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: I think I know your answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Let's move on.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think you know my answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BLITZER: Let's talk about these promises. Day one, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>he has got a long list of things he's going to do.</p><p>BORGER: Right. He's not going to sleep much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Some people say that's sort of dangerous, risky to make all those promises if he's elected.</p><p>BORGER: This is just a P.R. device. And let's not take it literally.</p><p>What he's saying is these are the things I want to do because he wants to make very clear to the American people how he differs from <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>But should he decide to actually issue executive orders on day one, which he probably would, he should look back to what happened to president-elect Obama.</p><p>Remember, president-elect Obama, first thing -- one of the first things he did was restrict access of lobbyists to the White House, close that revolving door. Well, eventually, he had to make some exceptions for people he wanted to put into his administration. Also, as you know very well know, Wolf, the closing of Guantanamo Bay by executive order, seems to me Congress had a different idea and that still has not occurred.</p><p>So this can boomerang for you. And some people are still saying to the president, you promised that on day one. What happened?</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. It didn't exactly work out, some of those commitments.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>BLITZER: It could happen again if -- and it's a huge if -- if Romney is elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: That's right, but Congress always, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, Congress believes it actually has something to say in these matters.</p><p>BLITZER: It's an equal branch of government, I believe.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: That's what we have all learned.</p><p>All right, look at these new polls that just came out today, the NBC News/Marist polls in battleground states, three of the most important, if not the most important right now.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio has <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>at 48 percent, Romney 42 percent. Let's go to Virginia. Look at this, Obama 48 percent, 44 percent. Florida, key battleground state obviously, right now in this poll, 48 percent for Obama, 44 percent for Romney.</p><p>In all of these polls, 3 percent sampling error. Is it too early, though...</p><p>BORGER: It is.</p><p>BLITZER: And I think the answer is yes -- for the president and his supporters to start celebrating?</p><p>BORGER: You know, asked and answered.</p><p>For example, there was another recent poll taken at about almost the same time in the really important state of Florida. Take a look at this, Quinnipiac University, and you see the registered voters here, there is a six-point difference in favor of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>So the pollsters can argue about their samples and which poll is more accurate and which is more heavily weighted towards Democrats or Republicans.</p><p>But here's one thing to keep in mind about these three states we're talking about today, that, actually, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>needs to win them all if he's going to have a clear path to 270 electoral votes. So that's Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>on the other hand, has lots of different ways to get to 270 because he's got more support in the West that he's going to try and draw on, like in the state of Colorado, maybe even in the state of Arizona, certainly New Mexico.</p><p>So he probably has to win one of these three states, but <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to have a trifecta here if he's going to have a path.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think, in my own sense, based on history, based on what I suspect is going on, the president will have the most difficult times in Florida and in Virginia.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio, I think he has a little bit better chance because he helped salvage the auto industry, and there are so many auto-related jobs in Ohio that might work well for him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And Virginia is also obviously another very tough battleground which the president won last time around. He wants to keep it in his corner. The Republicans believe they have got a lot of hope there. And, by the way, they believe they have a lot of hope in the state of Florida. What if, for example, Jeb Bush were on the ticket with <person><nameText>Mitt Romney? </nameText></person>That might help him out.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think it -- I'm sure it would help him not only in Florida, but it would help him with Hispanics in other states as well.</p><p>BORGER: That's right. That's right.</p><p>BLITZER: Gloria, thanks very much.</p><p>Let's go to Jack right now. He's got \"The Cafferty File\" -- Jack.</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Right about now, Wolf, Democrats are probably wishing they hadn't picked North Carolina as the site for this summer's convention.</p><p>When <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>selected Charlotte, North Carolina, more than a year ago, it seemed like a smart way to double down on the state that propelled him to victory in 2008.</p><p>North Carolina hadn't gone to the Democrats since Jimmy Carter.</p><p>But things have gone downhill and quickly in the Tar Heel State, and the list of problems seems pretty long.</p><p>For example, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage at about the same time that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>was saying he thinks it's a good idea.</p><p>Now gay rights activists want the convention moved out of North Carolina -- practically impossible to do at this point.</p><p>Unemployment in the Tar Heel State, 9.4 percent, far above the national average.</p><p>Plus, who dreamed this up? <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is going to give his convention speech in Bank of America Stadium. Perfect -- not.</p><p>Then there are the unions, one of the Democrats' key voting blocs. They're angry at North Carolina, aren't in the mood to help raise money.</p><p>That's because there are no unionized hotels in Charlotte. And North Carolina has the smallest proportion of union members and union membership in the country.</p><p>To top it all off, there are two sex scandals engulfing prominent North Carolina Democrats: the trial of former Senator John Edwards and the ongoing investigation of the state party chair, David Parker.</p><p>The Obama political operation used to be better than this.</p><p>Here's the question: Was it a mistake for Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention?</p><p>Go to CNN.com/Cafferty file. Post a comment on my blog. Or go to our post on THE SITUATION ROOM's Facebook page -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: It looked like a pretty good idea at the time, right after he won North Carolina, but 3.5 years later, maybe not.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Things have changed a lot.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes.</p><p>All right, Jack, thank you.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Sure.</p><p>BLITZER: A close call on a nuclear submarine. Fire breaks out less than a hundred feet from the reactor while the vessel is docked just a few dozen miles from a major city.</p><p>And does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>really have the lowest spending record of any president in more than half-a-century? We're checking a claim that's quickly gone viral.</p><p>Plus, he works at a conservative think tank, but he's blaming Republicans for the dysfunction here in Washington.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: A fire rages for a dozen hours aboard a nuclear-powered submarine, sending thick smoke over the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. Seven people were injured in the blaze.</p><p>Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us with the details.</p><p>Chris, how dangerous could this have been?</p><p>CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, if it had gone into a different part of the ship, this could have been dangerous indeed because this particular sub is powered by a nuclear reactor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE (voice-over): The submarine's crew couldn't stop it alone. Neither could the shipyard fire department. So the fire kept burning, less than a few hundred feet from a nuclear reactor onboard and more than 60 miles from Boston. The USS Miami was docked for repairs with no torpedoes or weapons onboard.</p><p>REAR ADM. RICK BRECKENRIDGE, U.S. NAVY, SUBMARINE GROUP COMMANDER: There's still nuclear fuel on board in the reactor. But the reactor is in a complete shutdown condition.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Subs like this are divided into two watertight compartments. The fire started in the forward area where most of the crew lives and that part had to be evacuated. The after compartment houses the nuclear reactor and propulsion team.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: They did not need to evacuate the ship. They were able to maintain their watch stations in the propulsion plan.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Imagine working in a three-story building that's only 30 feet wide. No windows, 80 percent of it crammed full of machinery. Now, imagine fighting a fire in those conditions.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: The temperature is very high, caustic fumes and smoke- filled compartment. Heroes respond to those kind of situations to save the ship.</p><p>LAWRENCE: There was a skeleton crew onboard. Experts say if the fire ignited out at see, the full crew could have put it out faster. If the fire started out in the nuclear reactor area, the real danger would have come from radiation exposure, not an explosion.</p><p>JOHN PIKE, GLOBALSECURITY.ORG: These submarine reactors have very high enrichment levels, nearly bomb grade, but not too bomb grade. So close doesn't count each even though they have highly enriched cores, much higher than, say Iran is enriching and they're not quite to bomb level and so you're not going to get a detonation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE: So under normal conditions, a crew member onboard a sub is exposed to radiation like we are just walking outside in the sun, but all of the crew members do have these radiation detectors on them that periodically are checked just to make sure they aren't receiving too much radiation. I spoke to a former sub commander who says he's never heard of a fire burning that long 12 hours out at sea like this one did in port.</p><p>He told me flat-out, Wolf, the crew wouldn't last that long.</p><p>BLITZER: Very scary. Do we know how this fire started?</p><p>LAWRENCE: Still under investigation. They had to vent out the ship basically in order to let the teams get in there to investigate that.</p><p>BLITZER: I'm sure there will be a full investigation in this one. Lessons learned hopefully. Thanks very much, Chris Lawrence.</p><p>An unlikely ally coming to the aide of cargo ships attacked by pirates. Lisa Sylvester is monitoring that and other top stories in THE SITUATION ROOM right now.</p><p>Lisa, what happened?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Wolf.</p><p>Well, Iranian sailors chased off armed pirates who had attacked an American freighter in the Gulf of Oman. According to Iranian state media, the pirates scattered when Iranian vessels responded to a distress signal and approach the American ship. The State Department is confirming that report.</p><p>Elton John has canceled concerts after being hospitalized in Los Angeles after a respiratory infection. John felt ill while performing a concert in Las Vegas last weekend. His publicist says he is out of the hospital with orders to rest for at least a week.</p><p>And there were mixed results on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 10 points, or a bout a tenth of a percent. But the S&amp;P 500 declined about the same amount, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped a half a percentage point. Experts say investors are concerned about Europe's debt crisis as well as new statistics from the U.S. on hiring and durable goods orders.</p><p>And more news about Facebook and, no, it's not about the company's troubles on Wall Street. Facebook, it's a new camera for the new iPhone and iPad. It's being unveiled today. It allows users to easily edit and share photos they've taken on their phone. Facebook announced it was paying $1 billion for the photo-sharing Instagram earlier this year. And today is the first big tech rollout from the company since going public.</p><p>And this, a photo of former President Bill Clinton posing with a pair of porn stars is raising some eyebrows. TMZ.com reports that the photo was taken at a casino in Monaco where Clinton was attending a fund-raising event for his foundation. One of the actresses posted a photo on her Twitter page. And it's not clear if Mr. Clinton knew the woman or if he was aware of their profession.</p><p>That is going to cause a little bit of a buzz on the Internet, I imagine, Wolf. People take pictures. What can you do?</p><p>SYLVESTER: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: Stuff happens.</p><p>All right. Thanks very much.</p><p>So, is <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>actually tight with taxpayer money? We're checking a new claim that he's got the lowest spending record in more than half a century.</p><p>And is the GOP to blame for the dysfunction in Washington? It's a shocking claim coming from a scholar and conservative think tank in Washington. Standby for the interview.</p><p>Plus, a Castro comes to the United States and reportedly comes out in favor of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>re-election.</p><p>That and a lot more coming up in our strategy session.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Republicans are blasting <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>as a big spender. But does he really have the lowest -- the lowest spending record of any president in more than half a century?</p><p>Our Mary Snow has been digging into the claim that's now gone viral.</p><p>Mary, what have you learned?</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, as you just mentioned, this claim is that the president has overseen the lowest growth in federal spending in 60 years. The White House quickly embraced it, but critics say the math isn't as cut and dry as it's made out to be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW (voice-over): On the campaign trail, Republican presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>often targets the president's spending.</p><p>The president is now firing back with this.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My opponent won't admit it, but, you know, it's been starting to appear in places, you know, real liberal outlets like \"The Wall Street Journal,\" since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.</p><p>SNOW: What's behind the president's comments is an editorial for CBS Market Watch which has an affiliation with \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Its title, \"The Obama spending binge never happened.\"</p><p>Obama supporters seized on it and it went viral, taking aim at Romney's spending claims. PolitiFact fact-checked the spending claim circulating on social media, it compared presidents and found spending under Obama grew 1.4 percent annually when it looked at raw dollars. It gave a mostly true rating to the claim that under Obama, there was the slowest federal spending in six decades, putting him second to President Eisenhower.</p><p>LOU JACOBSON, POLITIFACT: There are other factors you can look which are not as flattering to the president. Debt has gone up quite significantly over the same period of time, and then federal spending at the percentage of the gross domestic product is higher now than it has been under most of the recent presidents.</p><p>SNOW: But critics call the numbers fuzzy math. Brian Darling of the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation says it ties too much spending in 2009 to President Bush and he says it gives a false impression of spending levels under <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>BRIAN DARLING, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Well, the bottom line is if you take 2009 years and attribute it to Bush rather than <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>who is responsible for the spending -- most of the spending in 2009, it does make it look like he's restrained spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: Now, to be clear, the original analysis did account for $140 billion in spending in 2009, transferring from President Bush's spending to <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spending. But the critics are saying, look, basically, that doesn't go far enough -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: The debate will continue. Thanks very much.</p><p>They're a pair of veteran scholars from a liberal think tank and one from a conservative think tank, and they've sent out shock waves when they said the Republicans are mostly to blame for the gridlock and the dysfunction in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: And Norm Ornstein is joining us now from New York. He's the co-author with Tom Mann of a brand new book entitled, \"It's Even Worse Than It Looks\". It's a powerful new book, I highly recommend it.</p><p>But, Norm, let's talk about what you say because I was pretty surprised to hear your bottom line. Let me read a couple of lines that you and Tom wrote in \"The Washington Post\" recently.</p><p>\"We've been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believe it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise and unmoved by conventional understanding of facts and evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of the political opposition.\"</p><p>I read that, Norm, and I said, wow, that's pretty strong stuff from you. Give us a sentence or two why you say that?</p><p>NORM ORNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS\": You know, it wasn't an easy thing for us to say, Wolf, because we've tried to be impeccable. We call them as we see them, but we believe the problems of the country such as they are and after 32 years of being immersed in politics from Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, that what we now have is imbalance. We have parliamentary parties, but we have one party that's gone towards the edge of the process enough that it's more concerned with blocking anything done by the Democrats and the incumbent than in trying to find compromise and work toward solutions.</p><p>And no better example of this than what Richard Mourdock, the man who knocked off Dick Lugar, no moderate, a real conservative, but a problem solver, in Indiana just last week.</p><p>BLITZER: He obviously says he doesn't want to compromise. He wants to hold firm.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: But you basically blame a lot of the problems right now in two individuals, Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes, and I think there's a lot of blame to go around. Let me add that it's not like there are any angels here. Neither party is blameless, but it's an 80/20 mix now, and some of it goes back to what Newt did to break the stranglehold the Democrats had on the House of Representatives which lasted for 40 years. It took him 16 years but it was -- we've got to destroy this institution in order to save it. And along the way, it engendered a lot of the tribal politics that we have now.</p><p>Marry that to the pledge -- the Grover Norquist pledge that 95 percent or more of Republicans in the House and Senate signed -- you can't solve our debt problem as Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, the \"Gang of Six\" in the Senate, every group that's looked at this that's tried to span the ideological spectrum has said, must include some revenues. If you say, my way or the highway, not a dime in revenues.</p><p>BLITZER: Listen to what Republican Congressman Allen West of Florida said last month. This obviously a favorite of the Tea Party. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLA.: I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. In case our viewers didn't hear that, \"I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.\" Now he's not backing away from that at all, but that was pretty shocking, A, but what was even more shocking to you -- and you point this out.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Yes, and it basically is, you get statements like that and you know there are people who say outrageous things in many cases but not a single member of the Republican leadership or establishment from the Speaker of the House to the Republican candidate for president condemned what was Joe McCarthy reincarnated here.</p><p>It was an outrageous thing to say. It's still a smear to call somebody a member of the Communist Party and that -- you didn't have anyone standing up here, tells us that even those people who would like to presumably solve problems or move to the center right, which is where the Republican Party had been, are just not going to step up when you get extreme things said.</p><p>And of course, the fact that West isn't backing down at all also tells us that there's no sense of shame anymore in making outrageous statements, you double down. And that's no way to reach some kind of common ground or collaborate on policies and to solve problems that are not going to be done unless you find that common ground.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, it's been the reaction, I curious, over at the American Enterprise Institute, you've been affiliated with them for a long time. It's a conservative think tank here in Washington. What are your colleagues saying to you?</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Well, you know, some of my colleagues are not happy and some have written rejoinders but mostly, everybody has been very supportive, whether they agree or disagree, they're happy that Tom and I have done a book that is grabbing a lot of attention and selling a lot of copies.</p><p>And so I've always been left alone to do and think and say whatever I want, whether people like it or not. And you know, look, let's face it, Wolf, a part of this is Tom, who's at Brookings, and I built a lot of capital over more than 40 years of studying this, being straight shooters and now we spent capital doing something and saying something that's pretty controversial and we'll draw some lines that a lot of people aren't going to like because we felt it was time and necessary to do it.</p><p>The book is entitled, It's Even Worse Than It Looks.\" The author, co- author, I should say, Norm Ornstein; the other author, Tom Mann. Norm, thanks very much.</p><p>Thank you, Wolf. It's always a pleasure.</p><p>The chairman of the Democratic National Committee is criticizing, yes, criticizing the Obama administration for allowing the daughter of the Cuban leader Raul Castro to attend a conference in San Francisco. And wait until you hear what Mariela Castro now says about <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Stand by. We're going to talk about that. U.S.-Cuba relations in our \"Strategy Session.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:</p><p>There's stuff happening in U.S.-Cuban relations that I want to discuss in today's \"Strategy Session.\" Joining us right now, the democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile and the Republican strategist and CNN political contributor Alex Castellanos.</p><p>And the reason I want to discuss it with both of you, U.S.-Cuba relations, you were there about a year ago. You met with Alan gross, the American prisoner who's held. They spent about two hours with him.</p><p>Alex, you're a Cuban-American. You've studied this issue for a long time, so you both have interests.</p><p>Now the Obama administration granted a visa to a whole bunch of Cubans, Cuban Communists, to go to a conference for gay rights in San Francisco, including the daughter of the president, Raul Castro, Mariela Castro. Listen to what Senator Marco Rubio told CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLA.: It was a mistake because she's not just a citizen of Cuba or a visitor from Cuba. She's an agent of the Castro government. She is a propaganda agent of, an enemy of the United States and an anti-American regime, coming to the United States to spread her propaganda here. And that's the first.</p><p>And the second is she's an agent of a government that is a state sponsor of terrorism. So for these reasons, I've joined in a bipartisan protest to the granting of that visa.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Was it was a mistake to grant her a visa, Donna, to come to the United States?</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION: No, this is her second trip to the United States. She was here about 10 years ago. No, I don't believe it was a mistake. Look, I believe in freedom of expression, I believe a part of our principles as Americans, that we allow people to travel freely.</p><p>She's been here before. I met with her along with many other American officials to talk about her work on HIV/AIDS and prevention, sex education. She's an interesting person. She doesn't work for the government. Her father is the president of the country. I think there's nothing wrong with the exchange --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: She was granted a visa during the Bush administration when the president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the secretary of state was Colin Powell. So Donna's correct. This isn't the first time that the daughter of Raul Castro was invited -- given a visa to come to the United States.</p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, Republican STRATEGIST: And that should have been the last time. Everybody in Cuba works for the government, by the way. That's all there is. No, you don't -- you legitimize something. You take tyranny and you make it appear normal.</p><p>Her job is to come over here and appear that -- like she's one of us, that she shares the same interests and concerns and we can't take that at face value, of course, because they are a very different country, where they imprison people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: (Inaudible). Donna, you're disagreeing not only with Alex Castellanos, who is a good Republican, with -- not only with Reince Priebus, who is the chairman of the Republican Party, but you're also disagreeing with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the congresswoman from Florida, who is also the chair of the DNC, the Democratic National Committee and Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator who is running for re-election from Florida. They agree this was a bad idea.</p><p>BRAZILE: I don't think they'll expel me from the Democratic Party because I hold opposing views.</p><p>BLITZER: Pretty unusual, though, for the chair of the DNC to be critical of the president's -- the Obama administration's decision.</p><p>BRAZILE: You know --</p><p>CASTELLANOS: (Inaudible).</p><p>BRAZILE: Debbie is from Florida and I --</p><p>BLITZER: So she did it for political (inaudible)? BRAZILE: I had my deal (inaudible) Gonzalez and the situation when with I was Al Gore's campaign manager. I understand Florida politics. I understand Cuban politics. We've had 50 years of this embargo -- 50 years. And you know what? We have to get rid of this Cold War mentality. Cuba is changing.</p><p>Look, I did not go there to appease. I met with the cardinal. I met with dissidents. I met with Cuban officials and I met with Alan gross. So I wasn't going there as a propaganda machine. I was going there to find out what's going on 90 miles from our border.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, go ahead, Alex.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: Look, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has the courage to do the right thing when it's politically popular in her home state. Sure it's politics, but it is the right thing to do. And as far as the embargo in Cuba, there are two sides of that issue.</p><p>There are a lot of folks, Wolf, who think that the most powerful weapon we have is freedom and free trade, and that's a good argument, until you get to the point, well, then, do you then sell stoves to Hitler? Do you do trade with a tyrant who is going to use the benefits of that economic trade to oppress his people?</p><p>BLITZER: Will playing nice with the daughter of Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, and others help free Alan Gross, the American citizen? It's two and a half years he's been stuck in Cuba right now for bringing some computers, some laptops, banned equipment to help this tiny Jewish community in Havana right now. Is this going to help? You've spent some time with him. He's been in jail now for two and a half years.</p><p>BRAZILE: Alan Gross should be freed. Alan Gross should be let go on humanitarian grounds. I think he's served much longer. We have freed other USAID workers from other parts of the world. He should be freed as well.</p><p>You know, it's interesting. The same equipment that he was accused of bringing into Cuba to spy, I pretty much had it in my purse. I had my laptop, I had my iPad, you know, I had my camcorder.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You're lucky you're here.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, because, you know, come on. But it's clear to me that this is an atrocity. Alan has suffered a great deal. He's lost over 100 pounds. I met with his wife, Judy. I met with his lawyers, Peter (ph). But let's go back to this Castro thing. The country is changing. I hope to go back there one day. The country is changing. The Cuban government is --</p><p>BLITZER: I think that my own sense is if they released Alan gross that would help your position right now because it could lead to an improved relationship the U.S. and Cuba.</p><p>And listen to what Mariela Castro, the daughter of Raul Castro, the niece of Fidel Castro was quoted in \"The Miami Herald\" today, saying at this conference in San Francisco where she is right now, she's quoted as saying, \"I would vote for <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>I think he's sincere and speaks from the heart,\" to which the Romney campaign put out a statement, \"<person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>should disavow the endorsement of the daughter of the Cuban dictator, Raul Castro. It is galling that an envoy from a Communist regime would come to our country and lecture the American people on who to vote for while the regime refuses to hold free and fair elections and systematically violates the human rights of its people.\"</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You know, some Republicans are going to go nuts with something like this and say, see, I told you Obama was that far to the left. Of course, it has nothing to do with that. But it does tell you something about weakness.</p><p>There is so little respect for this president that people feel they can push him around. That's one reason the Cubans are hanging on to Alan Gross. They're using him as a bargaining chip to try to get the Cuban Five out. People try to infiltrate our military bases. They respect strength. They don't see it here.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to continue. We got to leave it there, but we're going to continue this conversation --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: (Inaudible) change taking place.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to watch what's going on and stay on top of it. I got that letter not that long ago from the Cuban interest section here in Washington at the embassy in Switzerland, and they make their case why Alan Gross deserves to be in jail, but there's -- they outline some options maybe for changing (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASTELLANOS: If you put in Spanish, you'd be El Lobo.</p><p>BLITZER: El Lobo. OK, guys, thanks very much.</p><p>We're going to update you on the mysterious case of a prominent marine biologist who remains a suspect in the brutal beating of his wife, even though she swears he was not involved. Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are trading jabs about the debt crisis. CNN's Erin Burnett is joining us.</p><p>Erin, I know you've been closely following this battle over the debt and what's called sequestration, these across-the-board cuts that would hurt both Democratic and Republican interests.</p><p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told \"Politico\" this -- and let me put it up on the screen -- \"I am not going to back off the sequestration, that's the law we passed. We did it because it wouldn't make things easy for us. It made it so we would have to do something.\"</p><p>Erin, what is going on here?</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: All right. Well, you could look at this two ways. One, it's a line in the sand that is sure to really upset Republicans, Wolf. As you know, they are trying to say, look, this $1.2 trillion in cuts, we want to prevent some of the defense cuts and instead take more money from social services. That's what they've been pushing to do.</p><p>But I have to say Harry Reid, hero of the day for saying, no. The whole point of these cuts is they would be nasty for everybody. If we can't do a grand bargain, let's go through with them exactly as they're scheduled.</p><p>So it's a line in the sand sure to upset Republicans but it seems like the right thing to do, and it sort of goes along with what John Boehner told me last week, which was sure to upset Democrats, but it's also the right thing to do. Here's that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It took me eight months to get people interested in actually talking about fixing the problem. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: (Inaudible).</p><p>BOEHNER: Let's start now. Why are we going to wait until after the election?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: He's talking, of course, about the debt ceiling, Wolf, and saying, hey, you know what? I'm not going wait. I'm not going to wait. We got sequestration, we got unemployment benefits going away, Bush tax cuts going away, all of this going away after the election. You really think a lame duck session is going to do the great bargain America needs? No.</p><p>So he is also right. Tonight we'll talk about this, Wolf, and actually talk about the fact that the debt problem of which we are also acutely aware could be so much worse that anyone of us actually realize, to the tune of more than four times worse and $66 trillion. I'm going to explain why tonight on \"OUT FRONT.\"</p><p>BLITZER: 7:00 pm Eastern, I'll be watching. You're getting me nervous just hearing what you're saying, Erin, but I'm interested. You've got my curiosity, thanks very much.</p><p>BURNETT: All right.</p><p>BLITZER: A prominent scientist suspected in the brutal beating of his wife, but he says he was out of town at the time, and she doesn't remember a thing. Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Jack's back with \"The Cafferty File.\" Jack?</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The question this hour, Wolf, is was it a mistake for the Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention? It seemed like a good idea at the time, but a lot of stuff has changed down there, including that constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage.</p><p>Bobby writes, \"Hard to say but with politics almost anything can change the dynamics of the game at any time. I don't know if it was a mistake, but I seriously doubt it was an accident.\"</p><p>Paul writes from North Carolina, \"Jack, you should know better. There are a lot of intelligent, progressive people in my adopted home state, but a Tea Party-infested legislature elected in 2010 slipped the gay marriage amendment onto the ballot to appease their hardcore religious right base. Having the convention here is the right thing to do, because it confronts the wing nuts on their home turf. And when the thoughtful, sensible voters come out in November, the result will look a lot like it did in 2008.'' Kimmy writes from Salisbury, North Carolina, \"As you can see, I live in North Carolina and I don't want any political convention in my area. Personally, I think any party, Democrat or Republican, should choose a state where they are loved. We don't love Democrats.\"</p><p>Augusto in Los Angeles, \"Hi, Jack. I enjoy reading your blog. You don't pull any verbal punches. I think it's a huge mistake for the Democratic Convention. This time around it could cost Obama the presidency.\"</p><p>Bill in New Mexico writes, \"The convention mistake is not as bad as choosing to run Obama again for a second term.\"</p><p>Rick in Virginia writes, \"Only the strong are willing go into the lion's den.\"</p><p>And Ron writes, \"Jack, they could have held it on the moon. It wouldn't matter. We all know the results already. Personally, I hear Cartagena is a good party town.\"</p><p>If you want to read more about this, go to the blog CNN.com/caffertyfile or through our post on THE SITUATION ROOM's Facebook page.

Thank you.</p><p>A mysterious assault here in Washington, D.C. So why did authorities bar a man from his wife's hospital room? Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: A Washington woman brutally beaten within an inch of her life. Her husband a marine biologist, renowned in his field, now a prime suspect. More than a month after it happened, it's an investigation with more questions than answers. Lisa Sylvester has been investigating.</p><p>What are you finding out?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this is absolutely terrifying. Imagine being in your own home, being savagely beaten and having no memory of it. That's the case for one Washington woman. And police are looking into whether her husband was involved. But he tells CNN he would have never done this to his wife.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): The victim: Svetlana Guggenheim, a beautiful Russian translator who lies in a Washington hospital recovering from a brutal beating. The suspect: her husband of 18 years. David Guggenheim is a prominent marine biologist who has been featured on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>Detectives executed a search warrant and confiscated his phone, computer hard drives, Internet router and other items at his home late Tuesday. But in this interview with CNN, he insists he had nothing to do with her assault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER: Did you have anything to do with it? Could you have harmed your wife in any way?</p><p>DAVID GUGGENHEIM, MARINE BIOLOGIST: No, never. And there is no history of that. I would never hit her or anyone else. And we have a very peaceful marriage.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): David says he and his wife were on separate business trips. Svetlana returned home on April 4th. She sent him this text message, thanking him for keeping the house clean.</p><p>Her adult daughter spoke to her on the phone the next day, April 5th. David said he called his wife on April 5th, but there was no answer. He showed us the frantic text messages he sent her over the next two days.</p><p>SYLVESTER: Worried, he cut his trip short and came back here to their Washington, D.C., apartment and what he found shocked him. It was his wife, lying on the floor wearing only a blouse, her head and face badly beaten.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: There was a lot of dried blood on the floor, dried blood in her hair. She had an awful black eye, her left eye. She was shaking and semiconscious.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): Svetlana was rushed to the hospital. David remained by her side while she was in intensive care with no memory of what happened. He stayed with her until April 19th. That's when police officers told him he was barred from the hospital. For a month he had no access to her and was prevented from getting updates from doctors. David was under a cloud of suspicion.</p><p>CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explains why.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: If this was an assault, the lack of evidence of false entry certainly suggests that it was someone she knew and a husband, frankly, is always going to be a lead suspect.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): And the metro police department said there was a note in Svetlana's hospital file, in which she allegedly told a nurse her husband was involved with her beating. According to court records, quote, \"It is Ms. Guggenheim's explicit wishes that plaintiff not be permitted to have contact with her.\"</p><p>But David Guggenheim says that note has inconsistencies, including two different dates.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: I was with her on the 19th. She was in no condition to give any sort of statement on the 19th or before the 19th. I'm very suspicious of this memo.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): He thinks someone fabricated that memo. The metro police department and the district attorney's office declined to talk to CNN, citing the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Svetlana Guggenheim has since sworn in an affidavit her husband was not responsible and has no memory ever telling anyone that her husband was involved.</p><p>David has provided CNN with receipts from his trip to Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey during the timeframe when his wife was attacked. Train receipts, one from a Wal-Mart and a Starbucks. He remains a suspect, but is now allowed to see her in the hospital.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: Being able to see her now is -- I mean, it's -- I can't even express to you how emotional it is to be able to see her and care for her.</p><p>SYLVESTER: David Guggenheim has not been charged, but he hasn't been cleared, either. Their apartment has surveillance videos which the police now have, but they are not releasing these tapes, Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: How is she doing?</p><p>SYLVESTER: She's actually recovering. I mean, she's doing fairly well. They still don't know if she has any vision in her left eye. I mean, she had some significant head injuries. She had surgery, but they were able to reduce and there was some brain swelling, some brain bleeding, they were able to address that.</p><p>So she is well. She is talking. Still not walking yet. So she has had a long road to recovery. She's been in the hospital six weeks already, Wolf, so. BLITZER: Yes. Let's hope for the best.</p><p>All right, stay on top of it for us.</p><p>Thank you, Lisa.</p><p>[Byline: Gloria Borger, Jim Acosta, Wolf Blitzer, Chris Lawrence, Lisa Sylvester, Mary Snow] [Guest: Norm Ornstein] [High: How does <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spending record measure up?

You could go to dinner with George Clooney and the president, that huge fund-raiser they had out in Hollywood a few weeks ago.</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right.</p><p>BLITZER: So it looks like they're trying to use some of the same gimmicks.</p><p>ACOSTA: They're pulling out the heavy artillery, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, Donald Trump, George Clooney. What do you think?</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right. It's hard to pick. Maybe Gloria could tell us who she'd pick, who she would have dinner with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Well, let's bring in Gloria. She's here right now, our chief political analyst.</p><p>BLITZER: Donald Trump, George Clooney.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: I think I know your answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Let's move on.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think you know my answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BLITZER: Let's talk about these promises. Day one, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>he has got a long list of things he's going to do.</p><p>BORGER: Right. He's not going to sleep much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Some people say that's sort of dangerous, risky to make all those promises if he's elected.</p><p>BORGER: This is just a P.R. device. And let's not take it literally.</p><p>What he's saying is these are the things I want to do because he wants to make very clear to the American people how he differs from <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>But should he decide to actually issue executive orders on day one, which he probably would, he should look back to what happened to president-elect Obama.</p><p>Remember, president-elect Obama, first thing -- one of the first things he did was restrict access of lobbyists to the White House, close that revolving door. Well, eventually, he had to make some exceptions for people he wanted to put into his administration. Also, as you know very well know, Wolf, the closing of Guantanamo Bay by executive order, seems to me Congress had a different idea and that still has not occurred.</p><p>So this can boomerang for you. And some people are still saying to the president, you promised that on day one. What happened?</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. It didn't exactly work out, some of those commitments.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>BLITZER: It could happen again if -- and it's a huge if -- if Romney is elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: That's right, but Congress always, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, Congress believes it actually has something to say in these matters.</p><p>BLITZER: It's an equal branch of government, I believe.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: That's what we have all learned.</p><p>All right, look at these new polls that just came out today, the NBC News/Marist polls in battleground states, three of the most important, if not the most important right now.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio has <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>at 48 percent, Romney 42 percent. Let's go to Virginia. Look at this, Obama 48 percent, 44 percent. Florida, key battleground state obviously, right now in this poll, 48 percent for Obama, 44 percent for Romney.</p><p>In all of these polls, 3 percent sampling error. Is it too early, though...</p><p>BORGER: It is.</p><p>BLITZER: And I think the answer is yes -- for the president and his supporters to start celebrating?</p><p>BORGER: You know, asked and answered.</p><p>For example, there was another recent poll taken at about almost the same time in the really important state of Florida. Take a look at this, Quinnipiac University, and you see the registered voters here, there is a six-point difference in favor of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>So the pollsters can argue about their samples and which poll is more accurate and which is more heavily weighted towards Democrats or Republicans.</p><p>But here's one thing to keep in mind about these three states we're talking about today, that, actually, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>needs to win them all if he's going to have a clear path to 270 electoral votes. So that's Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>on the other hand, has lots of different ways to get to 270 because he's got more support in the West that he's going to try and draw on, like in the state of Colorado, maybe even in the state of Arizona, certainly New Mexico.</p><p>So he probably has to win one of these three states, but <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to have a trifecta here if he's going to have a path.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think, in my own sense, based on history, based on what I suspect is going on, the president will have the most difficult times in Florida and in Virginia.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio, I think he has a little bit better chance because he helped salvage the auto industry, and there are so many auto-related jobs in Ohio that might work well for him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And Virginia is also obviously another very tough battleground which the president won last time around. He wants to keep it in his corner. The Republicans believe they have got a lot of hope there. And, by the way, they believe they have a lot of hope in the state of Florida. What if, for example, Jeb Bush were on the ticket with <person><nameText>Mitt Romney? </nameText></person>That might help him out.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think it -- I'm sure it would help him not only in Florida, but it would help him with Hispanics in other states as well.</p><p>BORGER: That's right. That's right.</p><p>BLITZER: Gloria, thanks very much.</p><p>Let's go to Jack right now. He's got \"The Cafferty File\" -- Jack.</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Right about now, Wolf, Democrats are probably wishing they hadn't picked North Carolina as the site for this summer's convention.</p><p>When <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>selected Charlotte, North Carolina, more than a year ago, it seemed like a smart way to double down on the state that propelled him to victory in 2008.</p><p>North Carolina hadn't gone to the Democrats since Jimmy Carter.</p><p>But things have gone downhill and quickly in the Tar Heel State, and the list of problems seems pretty long.</p><p>For example, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage at about the same time that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>was saying he thinks it's a good idea.</p><p>Now gay rights activists want the convention moved out of North Carolina -- practically impossible to do at this point.</p><p>Unemployment in the Tar Heel State, 9.4 percent, far above the national average.</p><p>Plus, who dreamed this up? <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is going to give his convention speech in Bank of America Stadium. Perfect -- not.</p><p>Then there are the unions, one of the Democrats' key voting blocs. They're angry at North Carolina, aren't in the mood to help raise money.</p><p>That's because there are no unionized hotels in Charlotte. And North Carolina has the smallest proportion of union members and union membership in the country.</p><p>To top it all off, there are two sex scandals engulfing prominent North Carolina Democrats: the trial of former Senator John Edwards and the ongoing investigation of the state party chair, David Parker.</p><p>The Obama political operation used to be better than this.</p><p>Here's the question: Was it a mistake for Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention?</p><p>Go to CNN.com/Cafferty file. Post a comment on my blog. Or go to our post on THE SITUATION ROOM's Facebook page -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: It looked like a pretty good idea at the time, right after he won North Carolina, but 3.5 years later, maybe not.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Things have changed a lot.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes.</p><p>All right, Jack, thank you.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Sure.</p><p>BLITZER: A close call on a nuclear submarine. Fire breaks out less than a hundred feet from the reactor while the vessel is docked just a few dozen miles from a major city.</p><p>And does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>really have the lowest spending record of any president in more than half-a-century? We're checking a claim that's quickly gone viral.</p><p>Plus, he works at a conservative think tank, but he's blaming Republicans for the dysfunction here in Washington.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: A fire rages for a dozen hours aboard a nuclear-powered submarine, sending thick smoke over the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. Seven people were injured in the blaze.</p><p>Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us with the details.</p><p>Chris, how dangerous could this have been?</p><p>CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, if it had gone into a different part of the ship, this could have been dangerous indeed because this particular sub is powered by a nuclear reactor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE (voice-over): The submarine's crew couldn't stop it alone. Neither could the shipyard fire department. So the fire kept burning, less than a few hundred feet from a nuclear reactor onboard and more than 60 miles from Boston. The USS Miami was docked for repairs with no torpedoes or weapons onboard.</p><p>REAR ADM. RICK BRECKENRIDGE, U.S. NAVY, SUBMARINE GROUP COMMANDER: There's still nuclear fuel on board in the reactor. But the reactor is in a complete shutdown condition.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Subs like this are divided into two watertight compartments. The fire started in the forward area where most of the crew lives and that part had to be evacuated. The after compartment houses the nuclear reactor and propulsion team.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: They did not need to evacuate the ship. They were able to maintain their watch stations in the propulsion plan.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Imagine working in a three-story building that's only 30 feet wide. No windows, 80 percent of it crammed full of machinery. Now, imagine fighting a fire in those conditions.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: The temperature is very high, caustic fumes and smoke- filled compartment. Heroes respond to those kind of situations to save the ship.</p><p>LAWRENCE: There was a skeleton crew onboard. Experts say if the fire ignited out at see, the full crew could have put it out faster. If the fire started out in the nuclear reactor area, the real danger would have come from radiation exposure, not an explosion.</p><p>JOHN PIKE, GLOBALSECURITY.ORG: These submarine reactors have very high enrichment levels, nearly bomb grade, but not too bomb grade. So close doesn't count each even though they have highly enriched cores, much higher than, say Iran is enriching and they're not quite to bomb level and so you're not going to get a detonation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE: So under normal conditions, a crew member onboard a sub is exposed to radiation like we are just walking outside in the sun, but all of the crew members do have these radiation detectors on them that periodically are checked just to make sure they aren't receiving too much radiation. I spoke to a former sub commander who says he's never heard of a fire burning that long 12 hours out at sea like this one did in port.</p><p>He told me flat-out, Wolf, the crew wouldn't last that long.</p><p>BLITZER: Very scary. Do we know how this fire started?</p><p>LAWRENCE: Still under investigation. They had to vent out the ship basically in order to let the teams get in there to investigate that.</p><p>BLITZER: I'm sure there will be a full investigation in this one. Lessons learned hopefully. Thanks very much, Chris Lawrence.</p><p>An unlikely ally coming to the aide of cargo ships attacked by pirates. Lisa Sylvester is monitoring that and other top stories in THE SITUATION ROOM right now.</p><p>Lisa, what happened?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Wolf.</p><p>Well, Iranian sailors chased off armed pirates who had attacked an American freighter in the Gulf of Oman. According to Iranian state media, the pirates scattered when Iranian vessels responded to a distress signal and approach the American ship. The State Department is confirming that report.</p><p>Elton John has canceled concerts after being hospitalized in Los Angeles after a respiratory infection. John felt ill while performing a concert in Las Vegas last weekend. His publicist says he is out of the hospital with orders to rest for at least a week.</p><p>And there were mixed results on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 10 points, or a bout a tenth of a percent. But the S&amp;P 500 declined about the same amount, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped a half a percentage point. Experts say investors are concerned about Europe's debt crisis as well as new statistics from the U.S. on hiring and durable goods orders.</p><p>And more news about Facebook and, no, it's not about the company's troubles on Wall Street. Facebook, it's a new camera for the new iPhone and iPad. It's being unveiled today. It allows users to easily edit and share photos they've taken on their phone. Facebook announced it was paying $1 billion for the photo-sharing Instagram earlier this year. And today is the first big tech rollout from the company since going public.</p><p>And this, a photo of former President Bill Clinton posing with a pair of porn stars is raising some eyebrows. TMZ.com reports that the photo was taken at a casino in Monaco where Clinton was attending a fund-raising event for his foundation. One of the actresses posted a photo on her Twitter page. And it's not clear if Mr. Clinton knew the woman or if he was aware of their profession.</p><p>That is going to cause a little bit of a buzz on the Internet, I imagine, Wolf. People take pictures. What can you do?</p><p>SYLVESTER: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: Stuff happens.</p><p>All right. Thanks very much.</p><p>So, is <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>actually tight with taxpayer money? We're checking a new claim that he's got the lowest spending record in more than half a century.</p><p>And is the GOP to blame for the dysfunction in Washington? It's a shocking claim coming from a scholar and conservative think tank in Washington. Standby for the interview.</p><p>Plus, a Castro comes to the United States and reportedly comes out in favor of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>re-election.</p><p>That and a lot more coming up in our strategy session.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Republicans are blasting <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>as a big spender. But does he really have the lowest -- the lowest spending record of any president in more than half a century?</p><p>Our Mary Snow has been digging into the claim that's now gone viral.</p><p>Mary, what have you learned?</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, as you just mentioned, this claim is that the president has overseen the lowest growth in federal spending in 60 years. The White House quickly embraced it, but critics say the math isn't as cut and dry as it's made out to be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW (voice-over): On the campaign trail, Republican presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>often targets the president's spending.</p><p>The president is now firing back with this.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My opponent won't admit it, but, you know, it's been starting to appear in places, you know, real liberal outlets like \"The Wall Street Journal,\" since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.</p><p>SNOW: What's behind the president's comments is an editorial for CBS Market Watch which has an affiliation with \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Its title, \"The Obama spending binge never happened.\"</p><p>Obama supporters seized on it and it went viral, taking aim at Romney's spending claims. PolitiFact fact-checked the spending claim circulating on social media, it compared presidents and found spending under Obama grew 1.4 percent annually when it looked at raw dollars. It gave a mostly true rating to the claim that under Obama, there was the slowest federal spending in six decades, putting him second to President Eisenhower.</p><p>LOU JACOBSON, POLITIFACT: There are other factors you can look which are not as flattering to the president. Debt has gone up quite significantly over the same period of time, and then federal spending at the percentage of the gross domestic product is higher now than it has been under most of the recent presidents.</p><p>SNOW: But critics call the numbers fuzzy math. Brian Darling of the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation says it ties too much spending in 2009 to President Bush and he says it gives a false impression of spending levels under <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>BRIAN DARLING, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Well, the bottom line is if you take 2009 years and attribute it to Bush rather than <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>who is responsible for the spending -- most of the spending in 2009, it does make it look like he's restrained spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: Now, to be clear, the original analysis did account for $140 billion in spending in 2009, transferring from President Bush's spending to <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spending. But the critics are saying, look, basically, that doesn't go far enough -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: The debate will continue. Thanks very much.</p><p>They're a pair of veteran scholars from a liberal think tank and one from a conservative think tank, and they've sent out shock waves when they said the Republicans are mostly to blame for the gridlock and the dysfunction in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: And Norm Ornstein is joining us now from New York. He's the co-author with Tom Mann of a brand new book entitled, \"It's Even Worse Than It Looks\". It's a powerful new book, I highly recommend it.</p><p>But, Norm, let's talk about what you say because I was pretty surprised to hear your bottom line. Let me read a couple of lines that you and Tom wrote in \"The Washington Post\" recently.</p><p>\"We've been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believe it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise and unmoved by conventional understanding of facts and evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of the political opposition.\"</p><p>I read that, Norm, and I said, wow, that's pretty strong stuff from you. Give us a sentence or two why you say that?</p><p>NORM ORNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS\": You know, it wasn't an easy thing for us to say, Wolf, because we've tried to be impeccable. We call them as we see them, but we believe the problems of the country such as they are and after 32 years of being immersed in politics from Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, that what we now have is imbalance. We have parliamentary parties, but we have one party that's gone towards the edge of the process enough that it's more concerned with blocking anything done by the Democrats and the incumbent than in trying to find compromise and work toward solutions.</p><p>And no better example of this than what Richard Mourdock, the man who knocked off Dick Lugar, no moderate, a real conservative, but a problem solver, in Indiana just last week.</p><p>BLITZER: He obviously says he doesn't want to compromise. He wants to hold firm.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: But you basically blame a lot of the problems right now in two individuals, Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes, and I think there's a lot of blame to go around. Let me add that it's not like there are any angels here. Neither party is blameless, but it's an 80/20 mix now, and some of it goes back to what Newt did to break the stranglehold the Democrats had on the House of Representatives which lasted for 40 years. It took him 16 years but it was -- we've got to destroy this institution in order to save it. And along the way, it engendered a lot of the tribal politics that we have now.</p><p>Marry that to the pledge -- the Grover Norquist pledge that 95 percent or more of Republicans in the House and Senate signed -- you can't solve our debt problem as Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, the \"Gang of Six\" in the Senate, every group that's looked at this that's tried to span the ideological spectrum has said, must include some revenues. If you say, my way or the highway, not a dime in revenues.</p><p>BLITZER: Listen to what Republican Congressman Allen West of Florida said last month. This obviously a favorite of the Tea Party. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLA.: I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. In case our viewers didn't hear that, \"I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.\" Now he's not backing away from that at all, but that was pretty shocking, A, but what was even more shocking to you -- and you point this out.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Yes, and it basically is, you get statements like that and you know there are people who say outrageous things in many cases but not a single member of the Republican leadership or establishment from the Speaker of the House to the Republican candidate for president condemned what was Joe McCarthy reincarnated here.</p><p>It was an outrageous thing to say. It's still a smear to call somebody a member of the Communist Party and that -- you didn't have anyone standing up here, tells us that even those people who would like to presumably solve problems or move to the center right, which is where the Republican Party had been, are just not going to step up when you get extreme things said.</p><p>And of course, the fact that West isn't backing down at all also tells us that there's no sense of shame anymore in making outrageous statements, you double down. And that's no way to reach some kind of common ground or collaborate on policies and to solve problems that are not going to be done unless you find that common ground.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, it's been the reaction, I curious, over at the American Enterprise Institute, you've been affiliated with them for a long time. It's a conservative think tank here in Washington. What are your colleagues saying to you?</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Well, you know, some of my colleagues are not happy and some have written rejoinders but mostly, everybody has been very supportive, whether they agree or disagree, they're happy that Tom and I have done a book that is grabbing a lot of attention and selling a lot of copies.</p><p>And so I've always been left alone to do and think and say whatever I want, whether people like it or not. And you know, look, let's face it, Wolf, a part of this is Tom, who's at Brookings, and I built a lot of capital over more than 40 years of studying this, being straight shooters and now we spent capital doing something and saying something that's pretty controversial and we'll draw some lines that a lot of people aren't going to like because we felt it was time and necessary to do it.</p><p>The book is entitled, It's Even Worse Than It Looks.\" The author, co- author, I should say, Norm Ornstein; the other author, Tom Mann. Norm, thanks very much.</p><p>Thank you, Wolf. It's always a pleasure.</p><p>The chairman of the Democratic National Committee is criticizing, yes, criticizing the Obama administration for allowing the daughter of the Cuban leader Raul Castro to attend a conference in San Francisco. And wait until you hear what Mariela Castro now says about <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Stand by. We're going to talk about that. U.S.-Cuba relations in our \"Strategy Session.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:</p><p>There's stuff happening in U.S.-Cuban relations that I want to discuss in today's \"Strategy Session.\" Joining us right now, the democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile and the Republican strategist and CNN political contributor Alex Castellanos.</p><p>And the reason I want to discuss it with both of you, U.S.-Cuba relations, you were there about a year ago. You met with Alan gross, the American prisoner who's held. They spent about two hours with him.</p><p>Alex, you're a Cuban-American. You've studied this issue for a long time, so you both have interests.</p><p>Now the Obama administration granted a visa to a whole bunch of Cubans, Cuban Communists, to go to a conference for gay rights in San Francisco, including the daughter of the president, Raul Castro, Mariela Castro. Listen to what Senator Marco Rubio told CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLA.: It was a mistake because she's not just a citizen of Cuba or a visitor from Cuba. She's an agent of the Castro government. She is a propaganda agent of, an enemy of the United States and an anti-American regime, coming to the United States to spread her propaganda here. And that's the first.</p><p>And the second is she's an agent of a government that is a state sponsor of terrorism. So for these reasons, I've joined in a bipartisan protest to the granting of that visa.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Was it was a mistake to grant her a visa, Donna, to come to the United States?</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION: No, this is her second trip to the United States. She was here about 10 years ago. No, I don't believe it was a mistake. Look, I believe in freedom of expression, I believe a part of our principles as Americans, that we allow people to travel freely.</p><p>She's been here before. I met with her along with many other American officials to talk about her work on HIV/AIDS and prevention, sex education. She's an interesting person. She doesn't work for the government. Her father is the president of the country. I think there's nothing wrong with the exchange --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: She was granted a visa during the Bush administration when the president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the secretary of state was Colin Powell. So Donna's correct. This isn't the first time that the daughter of Raul Castro was invited -- given a visa to come to the United States.</p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, Republican STRATEGIST: And that should have been the last time. Everybody in Cuba works for the government, by the way. That's all there is. No, you don't -- you legitimize something. You take tyranny and you make it appear normal.</p><p>Her job is to come over here and appear that -- like she's one of us, that she shares the same interests and concerns and we can't take that at face value, of course, because they are a very different country, where they imprison people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: (Inaudible). Donna, you're disagreeing not only with Alex Castellanos, who is a good Republican, with -- not only with Reince Priebus, who is the chairman of the Republican Party, but you're also disagreeing with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the congresswoman from Florida, who is also the chair of the DNC, the Democratic National Committee and Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator who is running for re-election from Florida. They agree this was a bad idea.</p><p>BRAZILE: I don't think they'll expel me from the Democratic Party because I hold opposing views.</p><p>BLITZER: Pretty unusual, though, for the chair of the DNC to be critical of the president's -- the Obama administration's decision.</p><p>BRAZILE: You know --</p><p>CASTELLANOS: (Inaudible).</p><p>BRAZILE: Debbie is from Florida and I --</p><p>BLITZER: So she did it for political (inaudible)? BRAZILE: I had my deal (inaudible) Gonzalez and the situation when with I was Al Gore's campaign manager. I understand Florida politics. I understand Cuban politics. We've had 50 years of this embargo -- 50 years. And you know what? We have to get rid of this Cold War mentality. Cuba is changing.</p><p>Look, I did not go there to appease. I met with the cardinal. I met with dissidents. I met with Cuban officials and I met with Alan gross. So I wasn't going there as a propaganda machine. I was going there to find out what's going on 90 miles from our border.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, go ahead, Alex.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: Look, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has the courage to do the right thing when it's politically popular in her home state. Sure it's politics, but it is the right thing to do. And as far as the embargo in Cuba, there are two sides of that issue.</p><p>There are a lot of folks, Wolf, who think that the most powerful weapon we have is freedom and free trade, and that's a good argument, until you get to the point, well, then, do you then sell stoves to Hitler? Do you do trade with a tyrant who is going to use the benefits of that economic trade to oppress his people?</p><p>BLITZER: Will playing nice with the daughter of Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, and others help free Alan Gross, the American citizen? It's two and a half years he's been stuck in Cuba right now for bringing some computers, some laptops, banned equipment to help this tiny Jewish community in Havana right now. Is this going to help? You've spent some time with him. He's been in jail now for two and a half years.</p><p>BRAZILE: Alan Gross should be freed. Alan Gross should be let go on humanitarian grounds. I think he's served much longer. We have freed other USAID workers from other parts of the world. He should be freed as well.</p><p>You know, it's interesting. The same equipment that he was accused of bringing into Cuba to spy, I pretty much had it in my purse. I had my laptop, I had my iPad, you know, I had my camcorder.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You're lucky you're here.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, because, you know, come on. But it's clear to me that this is an atrocity. Alan has suffered a great deal. He's lost over 100 pounds. I met with his wife, Judy. I met with his lawyers, Peter (ph). But let's go back to this Castro thing. The country is changing. I hope to go back there one day. The country is changing. The Cuban government is --</p><p>BLITZER: I think that my own sense is if they released Alan gross that would help your position right now because it could lead to an improved relationship the U.S. and Cuba.</p><p>And listen to what Mariela Castro, the daughter of Raul Castro, the niece of Fidel Castro was quoted in \"The Miami Herald\" today, saying at this conference in San Francisco where she is right now, she's quoted as saying, \"I would vote for <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>I think he's sincere and speaks from the heart,\" to which the Romney campaign put out a statement, \"<person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>should disavow the endorsement of the daughter of the Cuban dictator, Raul Castro. It is galling that an envoy from a Communist regime would come to our country and lecture the American people on who to vote for while the regime refuses to hold free and fair elections and systematically violates the human rights of its people.\"</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You know, some Republicans are going to go nuts with something like this and say, see, I told you Obama was that far to the left. Of course, it has nothing to do with that. But it does tell you something about weakness.</p><p>There is so little respect for this president that people feel they can push him around. That's one reason the Cubans are hanging on to Alan Gross. They're using him as a bargaining chip to try to get the Cuban Five out. People try to infiltrate our military bases. They respect strength. They don't see it here.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to continue. We got to leave it there, but we're going to continue this conversation --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: (Inaudible) change taking place.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to watch what's going on and stay on top of it. I got that letter not that long ago from the Cuban interest section here in Washington at the embassy in Switzerland, and they make their case why Alan Gross deserves to be in jail, but there's -- they outline some options maybe for changing (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASTELLANOS: If you put in Spanish, you'd be El Lobo.</p><p>BLITZER: El Lobo. OK, guys, thanks very much.</p><p>We're going to update you on the mysterious case of a prominent marine biologist who remains a suspect in the brutal beating of his wife, even though she swears he was not involved. Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are trading jabs about the debt crisis. CNN's Erin Burnett is joining us.</p><p>Erin, I know you've been closely following this battle over the debt and what's called sequestration, these across-the-board cuts that would hurt both Democratic and Republican interests.</p><p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told \"Politico\" this -- and let me put it up on the screen -- \"I am not going to back off the sequestration, that's the law we passed. We did it because it wouldn't make things easy for us. It made it so we would have to do something.\"</p><p>Erin, what is going on here?</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: All right. Well, you could look at this two ways. One, it's a line in the sand that is sure to really upset Republicans, Wolf. As you know, they are trying to say, look, this $1.2 trillion in cuts, we want to prevent some of the defense cuts and instead take more money from social services. That's what they've been pushing to do.</p><p>But I have to say Harry Reid, hero of the day for saying, no. The whole point of these cuts is they would be nasty for everybody. If we can't do a grand bargain, let's go through with them exactly as they're scheduled.</p><p>So it's a line in the sand sure to upset Republicans but it seems like the right thing to do, and it sort of goes along with what John Boehner told me last week, which was sure to upset Democrats, but it's also the right thing to do. Here's that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It took me eight months to get people interested in actually talking about fixing the problem. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: (Inaudible).</p><p>BOEHNER: Let's start now. Why are we going to wait until after the election?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: He's talking, of course, about the debt ceiling, Wolf, and saying, hey, you know what? I'm not going wait. I'm not going to wait. We got sequestration, we got unemployment benefits going away, Bush tax cuts going away, all of this going away after the election. You really think a lame duck session is going to do the great bargain America needs? No.</p><p>So he is also right. Tonight we'll talk about this, Wolf, and actually talk about the fact that the debt problem of which we are also acutely aware could be so much worse that anyone of us actually realize, to the tune of more than four times worse and $66 trillion. I'm going to explain why tonight on \"OUT FRONT.\"</p><p>BLITZER: 7:00 pm Eastern, I'll be watching. You're getting me nervous just hearing what you're saying, Erin, but I'm interested. You've got my curiosity, thanks very much.</p><p>BURNETT: All right.</p><p>BLITZER: A prominent scientist suspected in the brutal beating of his wife, but he says he was out of town at the time, and she doesn't remember a thing. Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Jack's back with \"The Cafferty File.\" Jack?</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The question this hour, Wolf, is was it a mistake for the Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention? It seemed like a good idea at the time, but a lot of stuff has changed down there, including that constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage.</p><p>Bobby writes, \"Hard to say but with politics almost anything can change the dynamics of the game at any time. I don't know if it was a mistake, but I seriously doubt it was an accident.\"</p><p>Paul writes from North Carolina, \"Jack, you should know better. There are a lot of intelligent, progressive people in my adopted home state, but a Tea Party-infested legislature elected in 2010 slipped the gay marriage amendment onto the ballot to appease their hardcore religious right base. Having the convention here is the right thing to do, because it confronts the wing nuts on their home turf. And when the thoughtful, sensible voters come out in November, the result will look a lot like it did in 2008.'' Kimmy writes from Salisbury, North Carolina, \"As you can see, I live in North Carolina and I don't want any political convention in my area. Personally, I think any party, Democrat or Republican, should choose a state where they are loved. We don't love Democrats.\"</p><p>Augusto in Los Angeles, \"Hi, Jack. I enjoy reading your blog. You don't pull any verbal punches. I think it's a huge mistake for the Democratic Convention.

Thank you.</p><p>A mysterious assault here in Washington, D.C. So why did authorities bar a man from his wife's hospital room? Stand by.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: A Washington woman brutally beaten within an inch of her life. Her husband a marine biologist, renowned in his field, now a prime suspect. More than a month after it happened, it's an investigation with more questions than answers. Lisa Sylvester has been investigating.</p><p>What are you finding out?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this is absolutely terrifying. Imagine being in your own home, being savagely beaten and having no memory of it. That's the case for one Washington woman. And police are looking into whether her husband was involved. But he tells CNN he would have never done this to his wife.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): The victim: Svetlana Guggenheim, a beautiful Russian translator who lies in a Washington hospital recovering from a brutal beating. The suspect: her husband of 18 years. David Guggenheim is a prominent marine biologist who has been featured on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>Detectives executed a search warrant and confiscated his phone, computer hard drives, Internet router and other items at his home late Tuesday. But in this interview with CNN, he insists he had nothing to do with her assault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER: Did you have anything to do with it? Could you have harmed your wife in any way?</p><p>DAVID GUGGENHEIM, MARINE BIOLOGIST: No, never. And there is no history of that. I would never hit her or anyone else. And we have a very peaceful marriage.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): David says he and his wife were on separate business trips. Svetlana returned home on April 4th. She sent him this text message, thanking him for keeping the house clean.</p><p>Her adult daughter spoke to her on the phone the next day, April 5th. David said he called his wife on April 5th, but there was no answer. He showed us the frantic text messages he sent her over the next two days.</p><p>SYLVESTER: Worried, he cut his trip short and came back here to their Washington, D.C., apartment and what he found shocked him. It was his wife, lying on the floor wearing only a blouse, her head and face badly beaten.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: There was a lot of dried blood on the floor, dried blood in her hair. She had an awful black eye, her left eye. She was shaking and semiconscious.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): Svetlana was rushed to the hospital. David remained by her side while she was in intensive care with no memory of what happened. He stayed with her until April 19th. That's when police officers told him he was barred from the hospital. For a month he had no access to her and was prevented from getting updates from doctors. David was under a cloud of suspicion.</p><p>CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explains why.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: If this was an assault, the lack of evidence of false entry certainly suggests that it was someone she knew and a husband, frankly, is always going to be a lead suspect.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): And the metro police department said there was a note in Svetlana's hospital file, in which she allegedly told a nurse her husband was involved with her beating. According to court records, quote, \"It is Ms. Guggenheim's explicit wishes that plaintiff not be permitted to have contact with her.\"</p><p>But David Guggenheim says that note has inconsistencies, including two different dates.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: I was with her on the 19th. She was in no condition to give any sort of statement on the 19th or before the 19th. I'm very suspicious of this memo.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): He thinks someone fabricated that memo. The metro police department and the district attorney's office declined to talk to CNN, citing the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Svetlana Guggenheim has since sworn in an affidavit her husband was not responsible and has no memory ever telling anyone that her husband was involved.</p><p>David has provided CNN with receipts from his trip to Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey during the timeframe when his wife was attacked. Train receipts, one from a Wal-Mart and a Starbucks. He remains a suspect, but is now allowed to see her in the hospital.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: Being able to see her now is -- I mean, it's -- I can't even express to you how emotional it is to be able to see her and care for her.</p><p>SYLVESTER: David Guggenheim has not been charged, but he hasn't been cleared, either. Their apartment has surveillance videos which the police now have, but they are not releasing these tapes, Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: How is she doing?</p><p>SYLVESTER: She's actually recovering. I mean, she's doing fairly well. They still don't know if she has any vision in her left eye. I mean, she had some significant head injuries. She had surgery, but they were able to reduce and there was some brain swelling, some brain bleeding, they were able to address that.</p><p>So she is well. She is talking. Still not walking yet. So she has had a long road to recovery. She's been in the hospital six weeks already, Wolf, so. BLITZER: Yes. Let's hope for the best.</p><p>All right, stay on top of it for us.</p><p>Thank you, Lisa.</p><p>[Byline: Gloria Borger, Jim Acosta, Wolf Blitzer, Chris Lawrence, Lisa Sylvester, Mary Snow] [Guest: Norm Ornstein] [High: How does <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spending record measure up?

The winner gets a ride from the airport in the Trump vehicle, a night in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a tour of the boardroom on the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" set and dinner of course with Romney and the Donald.</p><p>Wolf, take that, George Clooney.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, it sounds -- yes, sounds like he's going to the president's playbook, because the president has a similar raffle. You could go to dinner with George Clooney and the president, that huge fund-raiser they had out in Hollywood a few weeks ago.</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right.</p><p>BLITZER: So it looks like they're trying to use some of the same gimmicks.</p><p>ACOSTA: They're pulling out the heavy artillery, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, Donald Trump, George Clooney. What do you think?</p><p>ACOSTA: That's right. It's hard to pick. Maybe Gloria could tell us who she'd pick, who she would have dinner with.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Well, let's bring in Gloria. She's here right now, our chief political analyst.</p><p>BLITZER: Donald Trump, George Clooney.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: I think I know your answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Let's move on.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think you know my answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BLITZER: Let's talk about these promises. Day one, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>he has got a long list of things he's going to do.</p><p>BORGER: Right. He's not going to sleep much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: Some people say that's sort of dangerous, risky to make all those promises if he's elected.</p><p>BORGER: This is just a P.R. device. And let's not take it literally.</p><p>What he's saying is these are the things I want to do because he wants to make very clear to the American people how he differs from <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>But should he decide to actually issue executive orders on day one, which he probably would, he should look back to what happened to president-elect Obama.</p><p>Remember, president-elect Obama, first thing -- one of the first things he did was restrict access of lobbyists to the White House, close that revolving door. Well, eventually, he had to make some exceptions for people he wanted to put into his administration. Also, as you know very well know, Wolf, the closing of Guantanamo Bay by executive order, seems to me Congress had a different idea and that still has not occurred.</p><p>So this can boomerang for you. And some people are still saying to the president, you promised that on day one. What happened?</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. It didn't exactly work out, some of those commitments.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>BLITZER: It could happen again if -- and it's a huge if -- if Romney is elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: That's right, but Congress always, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, Congress believes it actually has something to say in these matters.</p><p>BLITZER: It's an equal branch of government, I believe.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: That's what we have all learned.</p><p>All right, look at these new polls that just came out today, the NBC News/Marist polls in battleground states, three of the most important, if not the most important right now.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio has <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>at 48 percent, Romney 42 percent. Let's go to Virginia. Look at this, Obama 48 percent, 44 percent. Florida, key battleground state obviously, right now in this poll, 48 percent for Obama, 44 percent for Romney.</p><p>In all of these polls, 3 percent sampling error. Is it too early, though...</p><p>BORGER: It is.</p><p>BLITZER: And I think the answer is yes -- for the president and his supporters to start celebrating?</p><p>BORGER: You know, asked and answered.</p><p>For example, there was another recent poll taken at about almost the same time in the really important state of Florida. Take a look at this, Quinnipiac University, and you see the registered voters here, there is a six-point difference in favor of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>So the pollsters can argue about their samples and which poll is more accurate and which is more heavily weighted towards Democrats or Republicans.</p><p>But here's one thing to keep in mind about these three states we're talking about today, that, actually, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>needs to win them all if he's going to have a clear path to 270 electoral votes. So that's Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.</p><p><person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>on the other hand, has lots of different ways to get to 270 because he's got more support in the West that he's going to try and draw on, like in the state of Colorado, maybe even in the state of Arizona, certainly New Mexico.</p><p>So he probably has to win one of these three states, but <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to have a trifecta here if he's going to have a path.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think, in my own sense, based on history, based on what I suspect is going on, the president will have the most difficult times in Florida and in Virginia.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>BLITZER: Ohio, I think he has a little bit better chance because he helped salvage the auto industry, and there are so many auto-related jobs in Ohio that might work well for him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And Virginia is also obviously another very tough battleground which the president won last time around. He wants to keep it in his corner. The Republicans believe they have got a lot of hope there. And, by the way, they believe they have a lot of hope in the state of Florida. What if, for example, Jeb Bush were on the ticket with <person><nameText>Mitt Romney? </nameText></person>That might help him out.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. I think it -- I'm sure it would help him not only in Florida, but it would help him with Hispanics in other states as well.</p><p>BORGER: That's right. That's right.</p><p>BLITZER: Gloria, thanks very much.</p><p>Let's go to Jack right now. He's got \"The Cafferty File\" -- Jack.</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Right about now, Wolf, Democrats are probably wishing they hadn't picked North Carolina as the site for this summer's convention.</p><p>When <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>selected Charlotte, North Carolina, more than a year ago, it seemed like a smart way to double down on the state that propelled him to victory in 2008.</p><p>North Carolina hadn't gone to the Democrats since Jimmy Carter.</p><p>But things have gone downhill and quickly in the Tar Heel State, and the list of problems seems pretty long.</p><p>For example, North Carolina voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage at about the same time that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>was saying he thinks it's a good idea.</p><p>Now gay rights activists want the convention moved out of North Carolina -- practically impossible to do at this point.</p><p>Unemployment in the Tar Heel State, 9.4 percent, far above the national average.</p><p>Plus, who dreamed this up? <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is going to give his convention speech in Bank of America Stadium. Perfect -- not.</p><p>Then there are the unions, one of the Democrats' key voting blocs. They're angry at North Carolina, aren't in the mood to help raise money.</p><p>That's because there are no unionized hotels in Charlotte. And North Carolina has the smallest proportion of union members and union membership in the country.</p><p>To top it all off, there are two sex scandals engulfing prominent North Carolina Democrats: the trial of former Senator John Edwards and the ongoing investigation of the state party chair, David Parker.</p><p>The Obama political operation used to be better than this.</p><p>Here's the question: Was it a mistake for Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention?</p><p>Go to CNN.com/Cafferty file. Post a comment on my blog. Or go to our post on THE SITUATION ROOM's Facebook page -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: It looked like a pretty good idea at the time, right after he won North Carolina, but 3.5 years later, maybe not.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Things have changed a lot.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes.</p><p>All right, Jack, thank you.</p><p>CAFFERTY: Sure.</p><p>BLITZER: A close call on a nuclear submarine. Fire breaks out less than a hundred feet from the reactor while the vessel is docked just a few dozen miles from a major city.</p><p>And does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>really have the lowest spending record of any president in more than half-a-century? We're checking a claim that's quickly gone viral.</p><p>Plus, he works at a conservative think tank, but he's blaming Republicans for the dysfunction here in Washington.</p><p>BLITZER: A fire rages for a dozen hours aboard a nuclear-powered submarine, sending thick smoke over the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. Seven people were injured in the blaze.</p><p>Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us with the details.</p><p>Chris, how dangerous could this have been?</p><p>CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, if it had gone into a different part of the ship, this could have been dangerous indeed because this particular sub is powered by a nuclear reactor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE (voice-over): The submarine's crew couldn't stop it alone. Neither could the shipyard fire department. So the fire kept burning, less than a few hundred feet from a nuclear reactor onboard and more than 60 miles from Boston. The USS Miami was docked for repairs with no torpedoes or weapons onboard.</p><p>REAR ADM. RICK BRECKENRIDGE, U.S. NAVY, SUBMARINE GROUP COMMANDER: There's still nuclear fuel on board in the reactor. But the reactor is in a complete shutdown condition.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Subs like this are divided into two watertight compartments. The fire started in the forward area where most of the crew lives and that part had to be evacuated. The after compartment houses the nuclear reactor and propulsion team.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: They did not need to evacuate the ship. They were able to maintain their watch stations in the propulsion plan.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Imagine working in a three-story building that's only 30 feet wide. No windows, 80 percent of it crammed full of machinery. Now, imagine fighting a fire in those conditions.</p><p>BRECKENRIDGE: The temperature is very high, caustic fumes and smoke- filled compartment. Heroes respond to those kind of situations to save the ship.</p><p>LAWRENCE: There was a skeleton crew onboard. Experts say if the fire ignited out at see, the full crew could have put it out faster. If the fire started out in the nuclear reactor area, the real danger would have come from radiation exposure, not an explosion.</p><p>JOHN PIKE, GLOBALSECURITY.ORG: These submarine reactors have very high enrichment levels, nearly bomb grade, but not too bomb grade. So close doesn't count each even though they have highly enriched cores, much higher than, say Iran is enriching and they're not quite to bomb level and so you're not going to get a detonation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE: So under normal conditions, a crew member onboard a sub is exposed to radiation like we are just walking outside in the sun, but all of the crew members do have these radiation detectors on them that periodically are checked just to make sure they aren't receiving too much radiation. I spoke to a former sub commander who says he's never heard of a fire burning that long 12 hours out at sea like this one did in port.</p><p>He told me flat-out, Wolf, the crew wouldn't last that long.</p><p>BLITZER: Very scary. Do we know how this fire started?</p><p>LAWRENCE: Still under investigation. They had to vent out the ship basically in order to let the teams get in there to investigate that.</p><p>BLITZER: I'm sure there will be a full investigation in this one. Lessons learned hopefully. Thanks very much, Chris Lawrence.</p><p>An unlikely ally coming to the aide of cargo ships attacked by pirates. Lisa Sylvester is monitoring that and other top stories in THE SITUATION ROOM right now.</p><p>Lisa, what happened?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Wolf.</p><p>Well, Iranian sailors chased off armed pirates who had attacked an American freighter in the Gulf of Oman. According to Iranian state media, the pirates scattered when Iranian vessels responded to a distress signal and approach the American ship. The State Department is confirming that report.</p><p>Elton John has canceled concerts after being hospitalized in Los Angeles after a respiratory infection. John felt ill while performing a concert in Las Vegas last weekend. His publicist says he is out of the hospital with orders to rest for at least a week.</p><p>And there were mixed results on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 10 points, or a bout a tenth of a percent. But the S&amp;P 500 declined about the same amount, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped a half a percentage point. Experts say investors are concerned about Europe's debt crisis as well as new statistics from the U.S. on hiring and durable goods orders.</p><p>And more news about Facebook and, no, it's not about the company's troubles on Wall Street. Facebook, it's a new camera for the new iPhone and iPad. It's being unveiled today. It allows users to easily edit and share photos they've taken on their phone. Facebook announced it was paying $1 billion for the photo-sharing Instagram earlier this year. And today is the first big tech rollout from the company since going public.</p><p>And this, a photo of former President Bill Clinton posing with a pair of porn stars is raising some eyebrows. TMZ.com reports that the photo was taken at a casino in Monaco where Clinton was attending a fund-raising event for his foundation. One of the actresses posted a photo on her Twitter page. And it's not clear if Mr. Clinton knew the woman or if he was aware of their profession.</p><p>That is going to cause a little bit of a buzz on the Internet, I imagine, Wolf. People take pictures. What can you do?</p><p>SYLVESTER: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: Stuff happens.</p><p>All right. Thanks very much.</p><p>So, is <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>actually tight with taxpayer money? We're checking a new claim that he's got the lowest spending record in more than half a century.</p><p>And is the GOP to blame for the dysfunction in Washington? It's a shocking claim coming from a scholar and conservative think tank in Washington. Standby for the interview.</p><p>Plus, a Castro comes to the United States and reportedly comes out in favor of <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>re-election.</p><p>That and a lot more coming up in our strategy session.</p><p>BLITZER: Republicans are blasting <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>as a big spender. But does he really have the lowest -- the lowest spending record of any president in more than half a century?</p><p>Our Mary Snow has been digging into the claim that's now gone viral.</p><p>Mary, what have you learned?</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, as you just mentioned, this claim is that the president has overseen the lowest growth in federal spending in 60 years. The White House quickly embraced it, but critics say the math isn't as cut and dry as it's made out to be.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW (voice-over): On the campaign trail, Republican presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>often targets the president's spending.</p><p>The president is now firing back with this.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My opponent won't admit it, but, you know, it's been starting to appear in places, you know, real liberal outlets like \"The Wall Street Journal,\" since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.</p><p>SNOW: What's behind the president's comments is an editorial for CBS Market Watch which has an affiliation with \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Its title, \"The Obama spending binge never happened.\"</p><p>Obama supporters seized on it and it went viral, taking aim at Romney's spending claims. PolitiFact fact-checked the spending claim circulating on social media, it compared presidents and found spending under Obama grew 1.4 percent annually when it looked at raw dollars. It gave a mostly true rating to the claim that under Obama, there was the slowest federal spending in six decades, putting him second to President Eisenhower.</p><p>LOU JACOBSON, POLITIFACT: There are other factors you can look which are not as flattering to the president. Debt has gone up quite significantly over the same period of time, and then federal spending at the percentage of the gross domestic product is higher now than it has been under most of the recent presidents.</p><p>SNOW: But critics call the numbers fuzzy math. Brian Darling of the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation says it ties too much spending in 2009 to President Bush and he says it gives a false impression of spending levels under <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>BRIAN DARLING, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Well, the bottom line is if you take 2009 years and attribute it to Bush rather than <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>who is responsible for the spending -- most of the spending in 2009, it does make it look like he's restrained spending.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: Now, to be clear, the original analysis did account for $140 billion in spending in 2009, transferring from President Bush's spending to <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>spending. But the critics are saying, look, basically, that doesn't go far enough -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: The debate will continue. Thanks very much.</p><p>They're a pair of veteran scholars from a liberal think tank and one from a conservative think tank, and they've sent out shock waves when they said the Republicans are mostly to blame for the gridlock and the dysfunction in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: And Norm Ornstein is joining us now from New York. He's the co-author with Tom Mann of a brand new book entitled, \"It's Even Worse Than It Looks\". It's a powerful new book, I highly recommend it.</p><p>But, Norm, let's talk about what you say because I was pretty surprised to hear your bottom line. Let me read a couple of lines that you and Tom wrote in \"The Washington Post\" recently.</p><p>\"We've been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believe it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise and unmoved by conventional understanding of facts and evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of the political opposition.\"</p><p>I read that, Norm, and I said, wow, that's pretty strong stuff from you. Give us a sentence or two why you say that?</p><p>NORM ORNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS\": You know, it wasn't an easy thing for us to say, Wolf, because we've tried to be impeccable. We call them as we see them, but we believe the problems of the country such as they are and after 32 years of being immersed in politics from Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, that what we now have is imbalance. We have parliamentary parties, but we have one party that's gone towards the edge of the process enough that it's more concerned with blocking anything done by the Democrats and the incumbent than in trying to find compromise and work toward solutions.</p><p>And no better example of this than what Richard Mourdock, the man who knocked off Dick Lugar, no moderate, a real conservative, but a problem solver, in Indiana just last week.</p><p>BLITZER: He obviously says he doesn't want to compromise. He wants to hold firm.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: But you basically blame a lot of the problems right now in two individuals, Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist.</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Yes, and I think there's a lot of blame to go around. Let me add that it's not like there are any angels here. Neither party is blameless, but it's an 80/20 mix now, and some of it goes back to what Newt did to break the stranglehold the Democrats had on the House of Representatives which lasted for 40 years. It took him 16 years but it was -- we've got to destroy this institution in order to save it. And along the way, it engendered a lot of the tribal politics that we have now.</p><p>Marry that to the pledge -- the Grover Norquist pledge that 95 percent or more of Republicans in the House and Senate signed -- you can't solve our debt problem as Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, the \"Gang of Six\" in the Senate, every group that's looked at this that's tried to span the ideological spectrum has said, must include some revenues. If you say, my way or the highway, not a dime in revenues.</p><p>BLITZER: Listen to what Republican Congressman Allen West of Florida said last month. This obviously a favorite of the Tea Party. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALLEN WEST (R), FLA.: I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. In case our viewers didn't hear that, \"I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.\" Now he's not backing away from that at all, but that was pretty shocking, A, but what was even more shocking to you -- and you point this out.</p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Yes, and it basically is, you get statements like that and you know there are people who say outrageous things in many cases but not a single member of the Republican leadership or establishment from the Speaker of the House to the Republican candidate for president condemned what was Joe McCarthy reincarnated here.</p><p>It was an outrageous thing to say. It's still a smear to call somebody a member of the Communist Party and that -- you didn't have anyone standing up here, tells us that even those people who would like to presumably solve problems or move to the center right, which is where the Republican Party had been, are just not going to step up when you get extreme things said.</p><p>And of course, the fact that West isn't backing down at all also tells us that there's no sense of shame anymore in making outrageous statements, you double down. And that's no way to reach some kind of common ground or collaborate on policies and to solve problems that are not going to be done unless you find that common ground.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, it's been the reaction, I curious, over at the American Enterprise Institute, you've been affiliated with them for a long time. It's a conservative think tank here in Washington. What are your colleagues saying to you?</p><p>ORNSTEIN: Well, you know, some of my colleagues are not happy and some have written rejoinders but mostly, everybody has been very supportive, whether they agree or disagree, they're happy that Tom and I have done a book that is grabbing a lot of attention and selling a lot of copies.</p><p>And so I've always been left alone to do and think and say whatever I want, whether people like it or not. And you know, look, let's face it, Wolf, a part of this is Tom, who's at Brookings, and I built a lot of capital over more than 40 years of studying this, being straight shooters and now we spent capital doing something and saying something that's pretty controversial and we'll draw some lines that a lot of people aren't going to like because we felt it was time and necessary to do it.</p><p>The book is entitled, It's Even Worse Than It Looks.\" The author, co- author, I should say, Norm Ornstein; the other author, Tom Mann. Norm, thanks very much.</p><p>Thank you, Wolf. It's always a pleasure.</p><p>The chairman of the Democratic National Committee is criticizing, yes, criticizing the Obama administration for allowing the daughter of the Cuban leader Raul Castro to attend a conference in San Francisco. And wait until you hear what Mariela Castro now says about <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Stand by. We're going to talk about that. U.S.-Cuba relations in our \"Strategy Session.\"</p><p>BLITZER:</p><p>There's stuff happening in U.S.-Cuban relations that I want to discuss in today's \"Strategy Session.\" Joining us right now, the democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile and the Republican strategist and CNN political contributor Alex Castellanos.</p><p>And the reason I want to discuss it with both of you, U.S.-Cuba relations, you were there about a year ago. You met with Alan gross, the American prisoner who's held. They spent about two hours with him.</p><p>Alex, you're a Cuban-American. You've studied this issue for a long time, so you both have interests.</p><p>Now the Obama administration granted a visa to a whole bunch of Cubans, Cuban Communists, to go to a conference for gay rights in San Francisco, including the daughter of the president, Raul Castro, Mariela Castro. Listen to what Senator Marco Rubio told CNN Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLA.: It was a mistake because she's not just a citizen of Cuba or a visitor from Cuba. She's an agent of the Castro government. She is a propaganda agent of, an enemy of the United States and an anti-American regime, coming to the United States to spread her propaganda here. And that's the first.</p><p>And the second is she's an agent of a government that is a state sponsor of terrorism. So for these reasons, I've joined in a bipartisan protest to the granting of that visa.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Was it was a mistake to grant her a visa, Donna, to come to the United States?</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION: No, this is her second trip to the United States. She was here about 10 years ago. No, I don't believe it was a mistake. Look, I believe in freedom of expression, I believe a part of our principles as Americans, that we allow people to travel freely.</p><p>She's been here before. I met with her along with many other American officials to talk about her work on HIV/AIDS and prevention, sex education. She's an interesting person. She doesn't work for the government. Her father is the president of the country. I think there's nothing wrong with the exchange --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: She was granted a visa during the Bush administration when the president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the secretary of state was Colin Powell. So Donna's correct. This isn't the first time that the daughter of Raul Castro was invited -- given a visa to come to the United States.</p><p>ALEX CASTELLANOS, Republican STRATEGIST: And that should have been the last time. Everybody in Cuba works for the government, by the way. That's all there is. No, you don't -- you legitimize something. You take tyranny and you make it appear normal.</p><p>Her job is to come over here and appear that -- like she's one of us, that she shares the same interests and concerns and we can't take that at face value, of course, because they are a very different country, where they imprison people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLITZER: (Inaudible). Donna, you're disagreeing not only with Alex Castellanos, who is a good Republican, with -- not only with Reince Priebus, who is the chairman of the Republican Party, but you're also disagreeing with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the congresswoman from Florida, who is also the chair of the DNC, the Democratic National Committee and Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator who is running for re-election from Florida. They agree this was a bad idea.</p><p>BRAZILE: I don't think they'll expel me from the Democratic Party because I hold opposing views.</p><p>BLITZER: Pretty unusual, though, for the chair of the DNC to be critical of the president's -- the Obama administration's decision.</p><p>BRAZILE: You know --</p><p>CASTELLANOS: (Inaudible).</p><p>BRAZILE: Debbie is from Florida and I --</p><p>BLITZER: So she did it for political (inaudible)? BRAZILE: I had my deal (inaudible) Gonzalez and the situation when with I was Al Gore's campaign manager. I understand Florida politics. I understand Cuban politics. We've had 50 years of this embargo -- 50 years. And you know what? We have to get rid of this Cold War mentality. Cuba is changing.</p><p>Look, I did not go there to appease. I met with the cardinal. I met with dissidents. I met with Cuban officials and I met with Alan gross. So I wasn't going there as a propaganda machine. I was going there to find out what's going on 90 miles from our border.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, go ahead, Alex.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: Look, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has the courage to do the right thing when it's politically popular in her home state. Sure it's politics, but it is the right thing to do. And as far as the embargo in Cuba, there are two sides of that issue.</p><p>There are a lot of folks, Wolf, who think that the most powerful weapon we have is freedom and free trade, and that's a good argument, until you get to the point, well, then, do you then sell stoves to Hitler? Do you do trade with a tyrant who is going to use the benefits of that economic trade to oppress his people?</p><p>BLITZER: Will playing nice with the daughter of Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, and others help free Alan Gross, the American citizen? It's two and a half years he's been stuck in Cuba right now for bringing some computers, some laptops, banned equipment to help this tiny Jewish community in Havana right now. Is this going to help? You've spent some time with him. He's been in jail now for two and a half years.</p><p>BRAZILE: Alan Gross should be freed. Alan Gross should be let go on humanitarian grounds. I think he's served much longer. We have freed other USAID workers from other parts of the world. He should be freed as well.</p><p>You know, it's interesting. The same equipment that he was accused of bringing into Cuba to spy, I pretty much had it in my purse. I had my laptop, I had my iPad, you know, I had my camcorder.</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You're lucky you're here.</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, because, you know, come on. But it's clear to me that this is an atrocity. Alan has suffered a great deal. He's lost over 100 pounds. I met with his wife, Judy. I met with his lawyers, Peter (ph). But let's go back to this Castro thing. The country is changing. I hope to go back there one day. The country is changing. The Cuban government is --</p><p>BLITZER: I think that my own sense is if they released Alan gross that would help your position right now because it could lead to an improved relationship the U.S. and Cuba.</p><p>And listen to what Mariela Castro, the daughter of Raul Castro, the niece of Fidel Castro was quoted in \"The Miami Herald\" today, saying at this conference in San Francisco where she is right now, she's quoted as saying, \"I would vote for <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>I think he's sincere and speaks from the heart,\" to which the Romney campaign put out a statement, \"<person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>should disavow the endorsement of the daughter of the Cuban dictator, Raul Castro. It is galling that an envoy from a Communist regime would come to our country and lecture the American people on who to vote for while the regime refuses to hold free and fair elections and systematically violates the human rights of its people.\"</p><p>CASTELLANOS: You know, some Republicans are going to go nuts with something like this and say, see, I told you Obama was that far to the left. Of course, it has nothing to do with that. But it does tell you something about weakness.</p><p>There is so little respect for this president that people feel they can push him around. That's one reason the Cubans are hanging on to Alan Gross. They're using him as a bargaining chip to try to get the Cuban Five out. People try to infiltrate our military bases. They respect strength. They don't see it here.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to continue. We got to leave it there, but we're going to continue this conversation --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: (Inaudible) change taking place.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to watch what's going on and stay on top of it. I got that letter not that long ago from the Cuban interest section here in Washington at the embassy in Switzerland, and they make their case why Alan Gross deserves to be in jail, but there's -- they outline some options maybe for changing (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASTELLANOS: If you put in Spanish, you'd be El Lobo.</p><p>BLITZER: El Lobo. OK, guys, thanks very much.</p><p>We're going to update you on the mysterious case of a prominent marine biologist who remains a suspect in the brutal beating of his wife, even though she swears he was not involved. Stand by.</p><p>BLITZER: Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are trading jabs about the debt crisis. CNN's Erin Burnett is joining us.</p><p>Erin, I know you've been closely following this battle over the debt and what's called sequestration, these across-the-board cuts that would hurt both Democratic and Republican interests.</p><p>The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told \"Politico\" this -- and let me put it up on the screen -- \"I am not going to back off the sequestration, that's the law we passed. We did it because it wouldn't make things easy for us. It made it so we would have to do something.\"</p><p>Erin, what is going on here?</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: All right. Well, you could look at this two ways. One, it's a line in the sand that is sure to really upset Republicans, Wolf. As you know, they are trying to say, look, this $1.2 trillion in cuts, we want to prevent some of the defense cuts and instead take more money from social services. That's what they've been pushing to do.</p><p>But I have to say Harry Reid, hero of the day for saying, no. The whole point of these cuts is they would be nasty for everybody. If we can't do a grand bargain, let's go through with them exactly as they're scheduled.</p><p>So it's a line in the sand sure to upset Republicans but it seems like the right thing to do, and it sort of goes along with what John Boehner told me last week, which was sure to upset Democrats, but it's also the right thing to do. Here's that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It took me eight months to get people interested in actually talking about fixing the problem. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: (Inaudible).</p><p>BOEHNER: Let's start now. Why are we going to wait until after the election?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: He's talking, of course, about the debt ceiling, Wolf, and saying, hey, you know what? I'm not going wait. I'm not going to wait. We got sequestration, we got unemployment benefits going away, Bush tax cuts going away, all of this going away after the election. You really think a lame duck session is going to do the great bargain America needs? No.</p><p>So he is also right. Tonight we'll talk about this, Wolf, and actually talk about the fact that the debt problem of which we are also acutely aware could be so much worse that anyone of us actually realize, to the tune of more than four times worse and $66 trillion. I'm going to explain why tonight on \"OUT FRONT.\"</p><p>BLITZER: 7:00 pm Eastern, I'll be watching. You're getting me nervous just hearing what you're saying, Erin, but I'm interested. You've got my curiosity, thanks very much.</p><p>BURNETT: All right.</p><p>BLITZER: A prominent scientist suspected in the brutal beating of his wife, but he says he was out of town at the time, and she doesn't remember a thing. Stand by.</p><p>BLITZER: Jack's back with \"The Cafferty File.\" Jack?</p><p>JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The question this hour, Wolf, is was it a mistake for the Democrats to pick North Carolina for their convention? It seemed like a good idea at the time, but a lot of stuff has changed down there, including that constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage.</p><p>Bobby writes, \"Hard to say but with politics almost anything can change the dynamics of the game at any time. I don't know if it was a mistake, but I seriously doubt it was an accident.\"</p><p>Paul writes from North Carolina, \"Jack, you should know better. There are a lot of intelligent, progressive people in my adopted home state, but a Tea Party-infested legislature elected in 2010 slipped the gay marriage amendment onto the ballot to appease their hardcore religious right base. Having the convention here is the right thing to do, because it confronts the wing nuts on their home turf. And when the thoughtful, sensible voters come out in November, the result will look a lot like it did in 2008.'' Kimmy writes from Salisbury, North Carolina, \"As you can see, I live in North Carolina and I don't want any political convention in my area. Personally, I think any party, Democrat or Republican, should choose a state where they are loved. We don't love Democrats.\"</p><p>Augusto in Los Angeles, \"Hi, Jack. I enjoy reading your blog. You don't pull any verbal punches. I think it's a huge mistake for the Democratic Convention. This time around it could cost Obama the presidency.\"</p><p>Bill in New Mexico writes, \"The convention mistake is not as bad as choosing to run Obama again for a second term.\"</p><p>Rick in Virginia writes, \"Only the strong are willing go into the lion's den.\"</p><p>And Ron writes, \"Jack, they could have held it on the moon. It wouldn't matter. We all know the results already. Personally, I hear Cartagena is a good party town.\"</p><p>If you want to read more about this, go to the blog CNN.com/caffertyfile or through our post on THE SITUATION ROOM's Facebook page. That is going to be an interesting convention.</p><p>BLITZER: I will be with there.</p><p>CAFFERTY: You going to be there?</p><p>BLITZER: Of course I will. Tampa, too. All right, Jack. Thank you.</p><p>A mysterious assault here in Washington, D.C. So why did authorities bar a man from his wife's hospital room? Stand by.</p><p>BLITZER: A Washington woman brutally beaten within an inch of her life. Her husband a marine biologist, renowned in his field, now a prime suspect. More than a month after it happened, it's an investigation with more questions than answers. Lisa Sylvester has been investigating.</p><p>What are you finding out?</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this is absolutely terrifying. Imagine being in your own home, being savagely beaten and having no memory of it. That's the case for one Washington woman. And police are looking into whether her husband was involved. But he tells CNN he would have never done this to his wife.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): The victim: Svetlana Guggenheim, a beautiful Russian translator who lies in a Washington hospital recovering from a brutal beating. The suspect: her husband of 18 years. David Guggenheim is a prominent marine biologist who has been featured on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>Detectives executed a search warrant and confiscated his phone, computer hard drives, Internet router and other items at his home late Tuesday. But in this interview with CNN, he insists he had nothing to do with her assault.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER: Did you have anything to do with it? Could you have harmed your wife in any way?</p><p>DAVID GUGGENHEIM, MARINE BIOLOGIST: No, never. And there is no history of that. I would never hit her or anyone else. And we have a very peaceful marriage.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): David says he and his wife were on separate business trips. Svetlana returned home on April 4th. She sent him this text message, thanking him for keeping the house clean.</p><p>Her adult daughter spoke to her on the phone the next day, April 5th. David said he called his wife on April 5th, but there was no answer. He showed us the frantic text messages he sent her over the next two days.</p><p>SYLVESTER: Worried, he cut his trip short and came back here to their Washington, D.C., apartment and what he found shocked him. It was his wife, lying on the floor wearing only a blouse, her head and face badly beaten.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: There was a lot of dried blood on the floor, dried blood in her hair. She had an awful black eye, her left eye. She was shaking and semiconscious.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): Svetlana was rushed to the hospital. David remained by her side while she was in intensive care with no memory of what happened. He stayed with her until April 19th. That's when police officers told him he was barred from the hospital. For a month he had no access to her and was prevented from getting updates from doctors. David was under a cloud of suspicion.</p><p>CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explains why.</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: If this was an assault, the lack of evidence of false entry certainly suggests that it was someone she knew and a husband, frankly, is always going to be a lead suspect.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): And the metro police department said there was a note in Svetlana's hospital file, in which she allegedly told a nurse her husband was involved with her beating. According to court records, quote, \"It is Ms. Guggenheim's explicit wishes that plaintiff not be permitted to have contact with her.\"</p><p>But David Guggenheim says that note has inconsistencies, including two different dates.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: I was with her on the 19th. She was in no condition to give any sort of statement on the 19th or before the 19th. I'm very suspicious of this memo.</p><p>SYLVESTER (voice-over): He thinks someone fabricated that memo. The metro police department and the district attorney's office declined to talk to CNN, citing the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Svetlana Guggenheim has since sworn in an affidavit her husband was not responsible and has no memory ever telling anyone that her husband was involved.</p><p>David has provided CNN with receipts from his trip to Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey during the timeframe when his wife was attacked. Train receipts, one from a Wal-Mart and a Starbucks. He remains a suspect, but is now allowed to see her in the hospital.</p><p>GUGGENHEIM: Being able to see her now is -- I mean, it's -- I can't even express to you how emotional it is to be able to see her and care for her.</p><p>SYLVESTER: David Guggenheim has not been charged, but he hasn't been cleared, either. Their apartment has surveillance videos which the police now have, but they are not releasing these tapes, Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: How is she doing?</p><p>SYLVESTER: She's actually recovering. I mean, she's doing fairly well. They still don't know if she has any vision in her left eye. I mean, she had some significant head injuries. She had surgery, but they were able to reduce and there was some brain swelling, some brain bleeding, they were able to address that.</p><p>So she is well. She is talking. Still not walking yet. So she has had a long road to recovery. She's been in the hospital six weeks already, Wolf, so. BLITZER: Yes. Let's hope for the best.</p><p>All right, stay on top of it for us.</p><p>Thank you, Lisa.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Mr Biden has led in poll after poll nationally and in almost every poll in the core six battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.<br/>However, latest polls suggest that Mr Trump''s position is no longer deteriorating.<br/>Nigel Green says: ''''Understandably, news agendas and conversations across the globe have been dominated by the impact of the pandemic for the last five months.<br/>''''As such, it has been all-too-easy to forget that for investors the defining issue of the year was always meant to be the forthcoming presidential elections in the world''s largest economy.<br/>''''Whoever wins the keys to the White House - Trump or Biden - we can expect some major policy shifts which could affect investments, taxation, regulatory landscapes and corporate earnings, amongst other issues, for the next four years.''''<br/>He continues: ''''There''s increasing talk of Joe Biden securing a ''''blue wave'''' Democratic sweep of the House, Senate and presidency.<br/>''''Should this happen it would likely hit risk assets, including equities.<br/>''''It also potentially could mean tax hikes for corporations and higher earners, the possible introduction of wealth tax, the break-up of Big Tech companies, environmental reforms, increasing regulation and more healthcare spending.''''<br/>He goes on to add: ''''Trump, the incumbent, and Biden have divergent economic policies.<br/>''''Trump''s agenda would likely include tax cuts, increasing infrastructure spending, and deregulation, which would be positive for stocks and other risk assets.<br/>''''He could also be expected to increase his ''''America First'''' stance to international commerce and to double down on trade issues with China, the world''s second-largest economy.''''<br/>The deVere CEO believes that investors would be wise to review their investment portfolios and strategies sooner rather than later.<br/>''''As always in a presidential election, there will be investment winners and losers. This time they could be even more pronounced due to the two candidates offering very different administrations.<br/>''''However, the priorities of whoever is in the White House can also change quickly to respond to unforeseen events - as we have all seen so dramatically this year.<br/>''''Therefore, I would suggest that investors review their portfolios to ensure that they are as ''''President-proof'''' as possible so that they can take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the risks regardless of who is the next President of the United States.<br/>''''This means proper diversification across asset classes, sectors, geography and currencies.''''<br/>Mr Green concludes: ''''Nothing can be taken as assumed in this critical presidential election. Investors should act now to grow and safeguard their wealth in any eventuality.''''<br/>MENAFN1182020000702288ID1100616743</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100616743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-BT51-JCNX-31ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The warning comes with just 84 days to go until the U.S. Presidential election on November 3.    Democrat former Vice President Joe Biden currently looks the likely victor against President Donald Trump. Mr Biden has led in poll after poll nationally and in almost every poll in the core six battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.    However, latest polls suggest that Mr Trump\u2019s position is no longer deteriorating.    Nigel Green says: \u201cUnderstandably, news agendas and conversations across the globe have been dominated by the impact of the pandemic for the last five months.    \u201cAs such, it has been all-too-easy to forget that for investors the defining issue of the year was always meant to be the forthcoming presidential elections in the world\u2019s largest economy.    \u201cWhoever wins the keys to the White House \u2013 Trump or Biden \u2013 we can expect some major policy shifts which could affect investments, taxation, regulatory landscapes and corporate earnings, amongst other issues, for the next four years.\u201d    He continues: \u201cThere\u2019s increasing talk of Joe Biden securing a \u2018blue wave\u2019 Democratic sweep of the House, Senate and presidency.    \u201cShould this happen it would likely hit risk assets, including equities.    \u201cIt also potentially could mean tax hikes for corporations and higher earners, the possible introduction of wealth tax, the break-up of Big Tech companies, environmental reforms, increasing regulation and more healthcare spending.\u201d    He goes on to add: \u201cTrump, the incumbent, and Biden have divergent economic policies.    \u201cTrump\u2019s agenda would likely include tax cuts, increasing infrastructure spending, and deregulation, which would be positive for stocks and other risk assets.    \u201cHe could also be expected to increase his \u2018America First\u2019 stance to international commerce and to double down on trade issues with China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201d    The deVere CEO believes that investors would be wise to review their investment portfolios and strategies sooner rather than later.    \u201cAs always in a presidential election, there will be investment winners and losers.  This time they could be even more pronounced due to the two candidates offering very different administrations.    \u201cHowever, the priorities of whoever is in the White House can also change quickly to respond to unforeseen events \u2013 as we have all seen so dramatically this year.    \u201cTherefore, I would suggest that investors review their portfolios to ensure that they are as \u2018President-proof\u2019 as possible so that they can take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the risks regardless of who is the next President of the United States.    \u201cThis means proper diversification across asset classes, sectors, geography and currencies.\u201d    Mr Green concludes: \u201cNothing can be taken as assumed in this critical presidential election. Investors should act now to grow and safeguard their wealth in any eventuality.\u201d   Share this</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42805348255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JN-4DC1-F07F-80G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Money Marketing</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Healthcare Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkVBOTZDMzQ2MUE4NDA1N0E0NDQyMUNBNzE1QUVCREQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODIyOTM3NTQwMkM3NDkxNjk3NUVDRjhENjQ1QTQwMTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzRCRkI3RTBDNEE3NEQxQkE5Q0RGRTMxQTQyMkU4RDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Last spring, worried that the United States was not keeping pace with China and other countries, Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, sent a memo to the White House imploring the president to create a national strategy on A.I. </p><p>  Now, Mr. Trump is about to take that step, though this ''American A.I. Initiative'' may not be as bold as some had hoped.</p><p>  The executive order aims to better educate workers in the field, improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build A.I. systems, and promote cooperation with foreign powers, a senior administration official said on a conference call with reporters on Sunday. But the order does not set aside funds for A.I. research and development, and the administration provided few details on how it will put its new policies into effect.</p><p>  The United States is engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war with China. And while American companies like Google and Amazonare now leaders in the field, A.I. experts are concerned that China could surpass the United States in the development of technologies that will power surveillance systems and autonomous weapons as well as driverless cars and a wide range of internet services.</p><p>  In July 2017, Chinese unveiled a plan to become the world leader in A.I., aiming to create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030, and two Chinese cities promised to invest $7 billion in the effort. Other governments, too, began making large investments, including South Korea, Britain, France and Canada.</p><p>  In the United States, the Defense Department has accelerated efforts to embrace A.I., shifting $75 million of its annual budget to a new office that will develop these technologies. Other government agencies also have major projects in the works. But many A.I. experts have worried that the top talent in the United States is moving to companies like Google and Amazonand away from government agencies.</p><p>  Last year, these concerns increased when Googlepulled out of a project to build A.I for the Pentagon after employees protested that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes. Companies like Googleare also expanding their operations in countries like China, France and Canada, as the A.I. talent in those countries continues to expand.</p><p>  In its briefing with reporters, the administration said it would increase efforts to educate American workers in the field. It plans to work with the National Council for the American Worker to create educational efforts through industry and academia, and it will call on government agencies to develop fellowships related to A.I.</p><p>  But the senior official did not provide specifics on how the United States will track the progress of these efforts.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Two robots powered by artificial intelligence on display at the World Internet Conference, China's big tech conference, in Wuzhen last fall.

And they say, no, no, he's the one that causes that fight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And he comes in and he talks about his country, but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up, flying the national flag of their country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: My opening monologue coming up in just a minute.</p><p>But, first, we go right back to the president. He is in Panama City Beach at a rally in Florida. Stay with us.</p><p>TRUMP: -- our border, save that flag, we love our country. We love our country but we're afraid of it. For purposes of getting into the United States, we are afraid of our country.</p><p>Now, we can't let this happen. The Democrats, we need the votes. We need the votes. Otherwise, you are going to have to vote them out of office -- Congress, the Senate, you're going to have to vote them out of office. Come November, next November, November 3rd next year, you're going to have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can't make a chase. We need the votes. We have to go through Congress.</p><p>However, we ended with this is incredible. But they don't mind it so much because they do not mind crime. They don't mind crime. No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad plan to protect and defend American's borders. They shouldn't be allowed to run.</p><p>And to confront this crisis -- you saw that! It was a big deal two months ago. I declared a national emergency, which is what it is. This is an invasion.</p><p>When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion. I was badly criticized for using the word \"invasion.\" It's an invasion.</p><p>And it's also in the invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK? It's an invasion of drugs. They all better be careful, because, you know, we are destroying the lives of hundreds and thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border. They better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now.</p><p>They have drug dens and drug labs in factories right along the border. They make the crack right there and send it over our border what we don't have walls. They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific, 2,000 miles!</p><p>Now, a lot of it, you don't need the wall because its mountains, big strong rivers, it's snake country. Nobody's walking to certain areas. You've got to like snakes a lot.</p><p>It's a rough country. But what we need and what we have done, but they can't do this. They can't let this happen. We've been very tough with them, I will be honest.</p><p>Mexico made $100 billion on average over the past ten years, 100 billion! They took 30 percent -- almost -- of our automobile business. We make cars. They send them to the United States. That won't happen anymore under the USMCA. It will be prohibited. It'll be economically prohibited.</p><p>Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border policies from being swiftly returned home. A border crosser comes in, you say, sorry, we are taking your home. That sounds nice. I want to do that, OK?</p><p>But we are the only one that has judges. Judges -- think about it. They come across, they have judges. Nobody else has judges. We give them a trial. We need Perry Mason. It's crazy. Folks, it's crazy.</p><p>And then they say, and the wall would help. It would not help, but the wall would stop it. When you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great -- and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons but we can't. Other countries do. We can't. I would never do that.</p><p>But how do you stop these people? You can't. There's -- that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that, folks.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Only in the panhandle! So it's a tough situation. But if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly. When the wall is finished, it's going to be great. Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. They are protected.</p><p>Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws. We must end catch- and-release. Stop human smugglers.</p><p>Have you seen what's happening? Human smugglers, human traffickers -- have you seen what they are doing? This is an ancient thing. It's an ancient crime.</p><p>It's bigger now because of the computer, the Internet than ever before, worldwide! Not just here, worldwide, and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall. They don't go through ports of entry -- you have people looking inside the cars. You can't do that.</p><p>If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can take them through a port of entry. And a lot of these people say, they come to the ports -- they don't come through the port. They come to areas where you don't have the wall. Fifteen miles up, make a left.</p><p>We've got to shut down century cities. Deport criminal aliens and replace the visa lottery, the chain migration, with a modern system of immigration. We have to do it.</p><p>On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream. It's never been. I've never been that I've never heard of anything like what's going on. I want to run so badly. I want to don't make this race to start immediately.</p><p>Now, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>That was written up by a real genius.</p><p>The Democrat Party believes in socialism. Take a look at Venezuela.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>Republicans believe in freedom. We need to get senators elected. We need to get the votes. We need congressmen and women elected, Republicans, we need to get the votes.</p><p>You've got to get out of there. You got to work. Otherwise we'll be playing around for too long.</p><p>And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers' wombs, right up until the moment of birth.</p><p>And then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that? The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby. Oh, can't do that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>So who heard of that one, that came up and that's now something -- and they don't even want to discuss it. They don't even want to discuss it.</p><p>And to protect innocent life, I call on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late- term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.</p><p>The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We want to make America great again. That's what we are doing.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>Will you please show these people? I go home, you know, you hear it. You hear it. You can hear how many people. But they never show it. They don't want to do it.</p><p>It's like in Florida or Florida State football game, isn't it?</p><p>We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every day we are making very, very good on our motto. In fact, much better than we promise. And you know what it is? Its promises made, promises kept.</p><p>We've actually given you more promises. My opponents said this. They weren't happy about this.</p><p>But we've given you more promises than we said we would do. That's very unusual for politicians. That may be a first.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants, big tech must not censor conservative or other voices.</p><p>We are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- that's right. You know about that, right? We did a big thing.</p><p>And the Democrats hate that I did this, because you know who started this in reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president. Because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.</p><p>Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform. Nobody thought it could be done. And we passed it. And it's tough as hill, but it's also fair. It's fair.</p><p>That's why we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as it's written, and we just confirmed -- listen to this, our 100th federal judge. We'll be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.</p><p>We've got to go great Supreme Court judges, what a difference having him appear makes you feel good about your country, doesn't it? It makes you really go to got your country.</p><p>We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs. We are doing big. Last year, prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years. Just today, we announced that the drug companies will be required by law to include prices in television advertisement, first time. It's going to drive the price down.</p><p>And we are vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency again.</p><p>And we will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, always. The Republican Party will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions. And for the veterans, we passed V.A. Choice, right?</p><p>So, now, as they wait in line for three weeks, ten days, four days, two months, people who weren't even very sick, the terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor? They immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans and trying to get it passed for 44 years, we've got it passed.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying -- V.A. accountability. Because under the V.A., you couldn't fire anybody. They were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything -- we had no way of firing these people.</p><p>Now, we passed V.A. accountability. They don't treat our vets right? Boom. You are fired.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Forty-six years they tried to get that. It's a little hard working -- I mean, in that case, it was against the union, against civil service, not too easy.</p><p>We are unlocking American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. One.</p><p>We are slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects. We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved. We brought it way down. We are trying to make it one year. We are close to getting that. We are down to two or three at the most.</p><p>This was taken 21 -- there was a certain road and a certain state. They were working on it for 21 years. It costs hundreds of times more money.</p><p>It used to be a straight line, now it's a line like this. You had a couple of drinks? You had a very bad shot of making it home.</p><p>It cost a fortune, 21 years. Now we are trying to get it down to one year. Maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons. That's OK. But you have people who worked on projects almost their entire life. And then they go to a vote on some counsel and they lose three to two?</p><p>Now, you may get rejected, it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly, you're not going to get rejected. It's going to be done in a really good way. So, we are trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything. There's no reason you should be taking 20 years.</p><p>And as promised, we've directed more than half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee. Herbert Hoover dike. Everybody wanted that done.</p><p>Your governor, both your governors -- your last governor and your current governor wanted that done. So, we have the Army Corps of Engineers, they're doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done. It'll now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule. I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially in Florida. The red tide.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It doesn't look too inviting. I come down to Florida. I say, what the hell is that? The red tide. So, we are going to get rid of it.</p><p>And to keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the gulf coast test range.</p><p>Do you know what that is, gulf? Anybody there? Anybody like practice shooting? Trust me, it's a good thing for you folks. You don't have to shoot.</p><p>It's a good thing, $133 million, the military needs it so badly. It's going to be very quickly completed, and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job.</p><p>As an example, at Eglin Air Force Base. Eglin. Eglin.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great people.</p><p>And we have made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrifice our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs, and tied us down to endless foreign wars. I do not know if you saw it, but about eight weeks ago, we took 100 percent of the caliphate. It was supposed to take two years in Syria -- ISIS.</p><p>That doesn't mean they are going to go around. These people are stone cold crazy. It doesn't mean that they will go around blowing up a store and blowing up something. They are just nuts.</p><p>But we took 100 percent. When I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind. I showed you the map. It was all -- so much ISIS. And within a short period of time, we wiped it out, the caliphate. We had 100 percent.</p><p>But still. Still. It's a mental condition. These people are stick. They are crazy. They are crazy.</p><p>So always keep your eyes open, be careful. And let law enforcement go when you see a kook. Let them know, because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth.</p><p>And everything we do, we are now putting America first. For years, we lost in so many different ways. We were losing on trade. We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance.</p><p>We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this. The NATO folks, they don't pay their fair share they were supposed to pay. We were taking over and sending almost 100 percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe.</p><p>And I said, that's not right. On top of that, the E.U. absolutely kills us on trade. It's all changing, folks. $100 billion extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO, because I said, you've got to pay off.</p><p>Your past presidents would go meet them and wouldn't talk about it or say, gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up. You've got to see. It was like a chart this way.</p><p>Now, it's like a rocket ship the other way. They are paying up, $100 million, they pay. $100 billion with a B.</p><p>Last month, I announce that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your Second Amendment. We love our Second Amendment.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment, and your rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p>I also withdrew the United States from the horrible he Iran the nuclear deal.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And, unfortunately, just today, I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, aluminum, and copper industries because I hope to be able to at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal.</p><p>We're not looking to hurt anybody. We want a fair deal. We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons. That's all we want.</p><p>I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And just two weeks ago, I announced the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That's a big deal.</p><p>And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror. They have done just a great job.</p><p>It's a dangerous place. The Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And our hearts are united with you people of Venezuela, and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight, the people of Cuba, and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free. It'll all happen, folks. It'll all happen.</p><p>Each of us in this great arena, this arena doesn't have a roof, but a minor detail. Problem is if you had a roof, couldn't hold this many people. So --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are all united by the same timeless values. We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the strong borders, strong families, and a strong national defense.</p><p>We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values. And we believe in the words of our national motto. In God, we trust.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans. These are the values that unite people in the panhandle. Panhandle. Oh, we love the panhandle.</p><p>You all love the panhandle! I think so.</p><p>You are incredible people. I tell you. You are incredible people.</p><p>You are smart, you're loyal, you are unbelievable people.</p><p>But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country, you join our movement because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of past politicians. You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense.</p><p>The system is rigged. I used to say it, it's still rigged, but a lot less rigged. We are getting a rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly, folks.</p><p>You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity, and he took back your country. You have always been loyal to this nation. Now, you finally have a president who was loyal to you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And every day between now and the November 3rd 2020, I think of that. November 3rd 2020. Boy, it's close, huh?</p><p>But every day, we are going to keep on working. We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Remember, I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me. You'd be winning so much in the state of Florida, Governor Ron would say, president, please, in the oval office, please, we are winning too much. We are used to this, Mr. President. We aren't used to this.</p><p>For years and years, we've been losers. We've been losing, Mr. President. Now, we are winning so much. The people of Florida cannot stand the winning so much. Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?</p><p>And I said, no, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry. He said, I thought you'd say that. We're going to keep winning. We are never going to be winning like we have now. You've never had winning numbers. You never had -- I think, more loyalty.</p><p>You look at what's happening to this state and you look at what's happening to this country, and we are proud again. We are proud again.</p><p>With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand. We are going to stand for liberty. We are going to stand for justice. We are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God. We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And together, with these proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again! We will make America strong again! We will make America safe again! And we will make America great again!</p><p>Thank you, Florida! Thank you very much.</p><p>(MUSIC))</p><p>HANNITY: All right. You can keep the volume up. Twelve thousand five hundred strong. The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people.</p><p>You know, the president is right. We do not see the crowd a lot. Frank is our great director here.</p><p>Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside. We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside. Pretty big arena. Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa. Pretty amazing.</p><p>All right. There you have it. The president wrapping up.</p><p>And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over. Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress. Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once. Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney.</p><p>Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report. And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. They already had 30 hours.</p><p>The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff. For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened. And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now.</p><p>And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.</p><p>And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.</p><p>In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?</p><p>This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19- term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un- redacted version of the Mueller report.</p><p>That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that.</p><p>Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.</p><p>The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!</p><p>Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee.</p><p>Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.</p><p>Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The subpoena is written as the beginning of a dialog process. This is a beginning of a process to talk to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice and ultimately, to go to court. But it's designed to be the foundation of a dialog and it's not designed to force our hand in what we insist on in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: This is not the first time that Nadler and his circus have been caught totally, completely, utterly contradicting himself. As it turns out, Nadler has one set of standards for his good friend Bill Clinton, remember him? Bill Clinton, the Starr report listed 11 separate felonies committed by Clinton.</p><p>He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.</p><p>They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: It's the culmination of nearly three months of requests, discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice for the complete un-redacted report by Special Counsel Mueller.</p><p>NADLER: Somebody, the staff of the Judiciary Committee, perhaps the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committee is going to have to go over this material, at least the 400 pages, 500 pages in the report to determine what is fit for release and what is, as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent, third parties, what must not be released at all.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think the President obstructed justice?</p><p>NADLER: Yes, I do. It's very clear that the President obstructed justice.</p><p>NADLER: We must not overturn an election and remove a President from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat.</p><p>NADLER: We have to protect the rule of law, and that means we have to investigate and hold hearings and layout to the American people if this Administration is involved of abuses of power or obstruction of justice.</p><p>NADLER: The American people have heard the allegations against the President and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him. They elected President Clinton; they still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Just a phony hypocrite. And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome.</p><p>Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.</p><p>So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second.</p><p>Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution. The hypocrisy of what he said then, what he's saying now.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's just amazing, Sean. I mean what we saw today is just insist for Barr (ph). They want to destroy Bill Barr because they don't like an Attorney General who actually does his job and follows the law - and follows the rules.</p><p>Think about what happened today. Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt. This is over 400 days for Eric Holder. We are less than 40. This is nothing but a political crusade to do -- mock Bill Barr, because they don't want what he is doing.</p><p>HANNITY: But Congressman, you said -- the reason they are doing it is because they fear what Barr said to Senator Lindsey Graham, which we played numerous times. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind. He has the final definitive answer there. But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront. Will it not, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: It will. And I think that's what we're seeing in the Attorney General. And what we have today is -- and again, you brought this up earlier. When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law.</p><p>You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing.</p><p>HANNITY: Congressman, last exit question in few short seconds we have. You courageously have released the closed-door testimony of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, and the General Counsel Baker and Strzok and Page. There are 53 other closed-door testimonies that I'm aware of, will you continue that release?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. Get ready for that. I would fill you by (ph). Just stay close Twitter, stay close the next few weeks. We will be releasing the rest of those.</p><p>HANNITY: Any this week, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: Probably not this week. But, we're getting ready for next week. We want to let the Democrats, their hypocrisy, shine this week. And we're going to get back in Fox what Bill Barr is doing and we're going to get back exposing this to the American people.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Congressman Collins, Georgia, thank you. Over the next weeks and months, two distinct sides are going to emerge. On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.</p><p>By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible.</p><p>And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified.</p><p>He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: The Attorney General says he believes spying occurred in looking after the President's van campaign. What do you think about that?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I have no idea what he's talking about. The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag.</p><p>DICKERSON: So the debate is a semantic one. The FBI was investigating into Trump Campaign, but you are sending they had cause to. And you just wouldn't use the word spy.</p><p>COMEY: Of course.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>HANNITY: He signed the FISA warrant that allowed -- well, based on -- we know perhaps even Russian disinformation according to The New York Times -- that allowed the spying of Carter Page. He just lied in what he said.</p><p>Now Democrats, they are running cover for Comey and everyone else who helped them perpetuate their hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories for years. And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself.</p><p>And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served. Our constitutional republic will survive.</p><p>Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.</p><p>It was you're questioning that nobody knew behind closed-doors that got us a lot more information and I can't wait to see the other 53 closed-door interviews that are coming. Good to see you both. Mark Meadows.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Good to be with you.</p><p>HANNITY: It's now beginning to unravel, the Attorney General, it's over. Mueller is dead. It's finished. They can cling as tightly as they want to their sinking ship and their conspiracy theory. But what is coming is FISA abuse, the FISA applications, the rigged investigation into Hillary, the attempt to bludgeon and undo an election, the attempts to steal an election, all now under the purview of the Attorney General and others. Where are we going with this?</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, I think in the coming days and by days, I mean just a few days, you will start to see a lot of this unravel. But as it unravels, part of why you are seeing Jerry Nadler and others go crazy is because they know that the truth is coming out.</p><p>And for as passionate as they were today and my good friend Jim Jordan did a great job in that committee hearing, but as passionate as they were today, they haven't been passionate when we've been in the privacy of those rooms, asking those questions, like Jim and I and others have. They won't even look at the documents because they don't want to know the truth.</p><p>And Director Comey, he has his day of reckoning too. He says they investigate -- we also know that they criminally leaked as well. So, it's time for accountability.</p><p>HANNITY: If the law is applied equally, do we have to go back to Hillary and the rigged investigation? By the way, you two got the information; you didn't share with me, which by the way, I deeply resent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You could have shared this information and given me exclusive. But I know, because of the closed-door testimony, number one, Lisa Page said, yes after nine months, the FBI had nothing.</p><p>But we also, Strozk and Page put all the--</p><p>JORDAN: Comey said that.</p><p>HANNITY: --FBI decisions on Hillary right inside Loretta Lynch's office. Then we've got a lot more - well we'll see what Inspector General Horowitz says, but where do you see it going? Jim Jordon?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean Comey said the same thing. All the way up to the day he was fired, he said he still had no evidence, any type of collusion, and obviously the Mueller Report demonstrated that as well.</p><p>To Jim Comey though, I mean, to not use the word spying, remember what we got last week from The New York Times. We got the - the story last Thursday where it said the FBI put a person posing as someone else to talk to George Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: Hold on Jim, you got to give the details.</p><p>JORDAN: That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: We had a 30-year-old flirtatious suggestive blonde bombshell spy trying to seduce information out of George Papadopoulos.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: You can put this in a bond movie.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. If that's not spying, tell me what is. And frankly, I did not know that anyone who actually puts much weight into what Jim Comey says now other than CNN is doing a--</p><p>HANNITY: Wait a minute, when he signed the first FISA warrant, okay wasn't that a warrant based on a dirty Russian dossier that might have been Russian disinformation according to The New York Times?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: To spy on Carter Page and the Trump Campaign? Did he not sign that, was not that on spying or am I just out of my mind?</p><p>JORDAN: We're not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEADOWS: It's worse than that. Yes, it's worse than that. He actually knew that there were credibility problems before he ever entered into it. That's the problem.</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Mark--</p><p>JORDAN: They didn't tell the court who paid - they didn't tell the court who paid for it. They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document.</p><p>HANNITY: Okay that's - by the way that would be I believe footnote eight in the dossier, in the application. Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, exactly right, Sean.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yes, all of it's been held. But I think there will be some good reporting that brings all of that to light in the very coming near future.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, both of you are in deep trouble because you kept it all from me and I hounded you to death for that information and you wouldn't give it to me.</p><p>When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead.</p><p>HANNITY: Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter.</p><p>Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.</p><p>The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap.</p><p>SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out.</p><p>And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report.</p><p>They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law.</p><p>I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school.</p><p>HANNITY: Apparently, you would both agree, that's spying Jim. Stop lying, you have the right to remain silent, I warn you again. Guys, sorry to cut it short, don't blame me, blame the President. He took my time. Alright, more Hannity after this break.</p><p>HANNITY: Alright unfortunately that's all the time we have for you this evening. Don't forget we will never be the rage, psychotic media mob. We are fair and balanced. Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible.</p><p>Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues.</p><p>I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019050801cb253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-KFD1-DXH2-64FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7382\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>BREAKING NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Right to Bear Arms</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU2RjgyMTk2MkZDNDgwNEI0QUQzQjI3QTA0N0NFNjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEJBMUU3RjlGRDM0NDFCNUI2MzNEQjQ5OERGMjE3RDU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

And they say, no, no, he's the one that causes that fight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And he comes in and he talks about his country, but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up, flying the national flag of their country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  My opening monologue coming up in just a minute.</p><p>But, first, we go right back to the president.  He is in Panama City Beach at a rally in Florida.  Stay with us.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- our border, save that flag, we love our country.  We love our country but we're afraid of it.  For purposes of getting into the United States, we are afraid of our country.</p><p>Now, we can't let this happen.  The Democrats, we need the votes.  We need the votes.  Otherwise, you are going to have to vote them out of office -- Congress, the Senate, you're going to have to vote them out of office.  Come November, next November, November 3rd next year, you're going to have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can't make a chase.  We need the votes.  We have to go through Congress.</p><p>However, we ended with this is incredible.  But they don't mind it so much because they do not mind crime.  They don't mind crime.  No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad plan to protect and defend American's borders.  They shouldn't be allowed to run.</p><p>And to confront this crisis -- you saw that!  It was a big deal two months ago.  I declared a national emergency, which is what it is.  This is an invasion.</p><p>When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion.  I was badly criticized for using the word \"invasion.\"  It's an invasion.</p><p>And it's also in the invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK?  It's an invasion of drugs.  They all better be careful, because, you know, we are destroying the lives of hundreds and thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border.  They better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now.</p><p>They have drug dens and drug labs in factories right along the border.  They make the crack right there and send it over our border what we don't have walls.  They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific, 2,000 miles!</p><p>Now, a lot of it, you don't need the wall because its mountains, big strong rivers, it's snake country.  Nobody's walking to certain areas.  You've got to like snakes a lot.</p><p>It's a rough country.  But what we need and what we have done, but they can't do this.  They can't let this happen.  We've been very tough with them, I will be honest.</p><p>Mexico made $100 billion on average over the past ten years, 100 billion!  They took 30 percent -- almost -- of our automobile business.  We make cars.  They send them to the United States.  That won't happen anymore under the USMCA.  It will be prohibited.  It'll be economically prohibited.</p><p>Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border policies from being swiftly returned home.  A border crosser comes in, you say, sorry, we are taking your home.  That sounds nice.  I want to do that, OK?</p><p>But we are the only one that has judges.  Judges -- think about it.  They come across, they have judges.  Nobody else has judges.  We give them a trial.  We need Perry Mason.  It's crazy.  Folks, it's crazy.</p><p>And then they say, and the wall would help.  It would not help, but the wall would stop it.  When you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great -- and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons but we can't.  Other countries do.  We can't.  I would never do that.</p><p>But how do you stop these people?  You can't.  There's -- that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that, folks.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Only in the panhandle!  So it's a tough situation.  But if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly.  When the wall is finished, it's going to be great.  Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.  They are protected.</p><p>Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws.  We must end catch-and-release.  Stop human smugglers.</p><p>Have you seen what's happening?  Human smugglers, human traffickers -- have you seen what they are doing?  This is an ancient thing.  It's an ancient crime.</p><p>It's bigger now because of the computer, the Internet than ever before, worldwide!  Not just here, worldwide, and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall.  They don't go through ports of entry -- you have people looking inside the cars.  You can't do that.</p><p>If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can take them through a port of entry.  And a lot of these people say, they come to the ports -- they don't come through the port.  They come to areas where you don't have the wall.  Fifteen miles up, make a left.</p><p>We've got to shut down century cities.  Deport criminal aliens and replace the visa lottery, the chain migration, with a modern system of immigration.  We have to do it.</p><p>On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream.  It's never been.  I've never been that I've never heard of anything like what's going on.  I want to run so badly.  I want to don't make this race to start immediately.</p><p>Now, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>That was written up by a real genius.</p><p>The Democrat Party believes in socialism.  Take a look at Venezuela.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>Republicans believe in freedom.  We need to get senators elected.  We need to get the votes.  We need congressmen and women elected, Republicans, we need to get the votes.</p><p>You've got to get out of there.  You got to work.  Otherwise we'll be playing around for too long.</p><p>And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers' wombs, right up until the moment of birth.</p><p>And then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that?  The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.  Oh, can't do that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>So who heard of that one, that came up and that's now something -- and they don't even want to discuss it.  They don't even want to discuss it.</p><p>And to protect innocent life, I call on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.</p><p>The Republican Party is the party for all Americans.  We want to make America great again.  That's what we are doing.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>Will you please show these people?  I go home, you know, you hear it.  You hear it.  You can hear how many people.  But they never show it.  They don't want to do it.</p><p>It's like in Florida or Florida State football game, isn't it?</p><p>We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every day we are making very, very good on our motto.  In fact, much better than we promise.  And you know what it is?  Its promises made, promises kept.</p><p>We've actually given you more promises.  My opponents said this.  They weren't happy about this.</p><p>But we've given you more promises than we said we would do.  That's very unusual for politicians.  That may be a first.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants, big tech must not censor conservative or other voices.</p><p>We are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- that's right.  You know about that, right?  We did a big thing.</p><p>And the Democrats hate that I did this, because you know who started this in reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president.  Because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.</p><p>Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform.  Nobody thought it could be done.  And we passed it.  And it's tough as hill, but it's also fair.  It's fair.</p><p>That's why we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as it's written, and we just confirmed -- listen to this, our 100th federal judge.  We'll be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.</p><p>We've got to go great Supreme Court judges, what a difference having him appear makes you feel good about your country, doesn't it?  It makes you really go to got your country.</p><p>We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  We are doing big.  Last year, prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years.  Just today, we announced that the drug companies will be required by law to include prices in television advertisement, first time.  It's going to drive the price down.</p><p>And we are vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency again.</p><p>And we will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, always.  The Republican Party will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions.  And for the veterans, we passed V.A. Choice, right?</p><p>So, now, as they wait in line for three weeks, ten days, four days, two months, people who weren't even very sick, the terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor?  They immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans and trying to get it passed for 44 years, we've got it passed.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying -- V.A. accountability.  Because under the V.A., you couldn't fire anybody.  They were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything -- we had no way of firing these people.</p><p>Now, we passed V.A. accountability.  They don't treat our vets right?  Boom.  You are fired.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Forty-six years they tried to get that.  It's a little hard working -- I mean, in that case, it was against the union, against civil service, not too easy.</p><p>We are unlocking American energy.  The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  One.</p><p>We are slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects.  We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved.  We brought it way down.  We are trying to make it one year.  We are close to getting that.  We are down to two or three at the most.</p><p>This was taken 21 -- there was a certain road and a certain state.  They were working on it for 21 years.  It costs hundreds of times more money.</p><p>It used to be a straight line, now it's a line like this.  You had a couple of drinks?  You had a very bad shot of making it home.</p><p>It cost a fortune, 21 years.  Now we are trying to get it down to one year.  Maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons.  That's OK.  But you have people who worked on projects almost their entire life.  And then they go to a vote on some counsel and they lose three to two?</p><p>Now, you may get rejected, it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly, you're not going to get rejected.  It's going to be done in a really good way.  So, we are trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything.  There's no reason you should be taking 20 years.</p><p>And as promised, we've directed more than half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee.  Herbert Hoover dike.  Everybody wanted that done.</p><p>Your governor, both your governors -- your last governor and your current governor wanted that done.  So, we have the Army Corps of Engineers, they're doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.  It'll now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule.  I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially in Florida.  The red tide.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It doesn't look too inviting.  I come down to Florida.  I say, what the hell is that?  The red tide.  So, we are going to get rid of it.</p><p>And to keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the gulf coast test range.</p><p>Do you know what that is, gulf?  Anybody there?  Anybody like practice shooting?  Trust me, it's a good thing for you folks.  You don't have to shoot.</p><p>It's a good thing, $133 million, the military needs it so badly.  It's going to be very quickly completed, and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job.</p><p>As an example, at Eglin Air Force Base.  Eglin.  Eglin.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great people.</p><p>And we have made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrifice our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs, and tied us down to endless foreign wars.  I do not know if you saw it, but about eight weeks ago, we took 100 percent of the caliphate.  It was supposed to take two years in Syria -- ISIS.</p><p>That doesn't mean they are going to go around.  These people are stone cold crazy.  It doesn't mean that they will go around blowing up a store and blowing up something.  They are just nuts.</p><p>But we took 100 percent.  When I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind.  I showed you the map.  It was all -- so much ISIS.  And within a short period of time, we wiped it out, the caliphate.  We had 100 percent.</p><p>But still.  Still.  It's a mental condition.  These people are stick.  They are crazy.  They are crazy.</p><p>So always keep your eyes open, be careful.  And let law enforcement go when you see a kook.  Let them know, because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth.</p><p>And everything we do, we are now putting America first.  For years, we lost in so many different ways.  We were losing on trade.  We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance.</p><p>We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this.  The NATO folks, they don't pay their fair share they were supposed to pay.  We were taking over and sending almost 100 percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe.</p><p>And I said, that's not right.  On top of that, the E.U. absolutely kills us on trade.  It's all changing, folks.  $100 billion extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO, because I said, you've got to pay off.</p><p>Your past presidents would go meet them and wouldn't talk about it or say, gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up.  You've got to see.  It was like a chart this way.</p><p>Now, it's like a rocket ship the other way.  They are paying up, $100 million, they pay.  $100 billion with a B.</p><p>Last month, I announce that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your Second Amendment.  We love our Second Amendment.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment, and your rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p>I also withdrew the United States from the horrible he Iran the nuclear deal.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And, unfortunately, just today, I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, aluminum, and copper industries because I hope to be able to at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal.</p><p>We're not looking to hurt anybody.  We want a fair deal.  We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons.  That's all we want.</p><p>I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And just two weeks ago, I announced the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  That's a big deal.</p><p>And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror.  They have done just a great job.</p><p>It's a dangerous place.  The Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And our hearts are united with you people of Venezuela, and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight, the people of Cuba, and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free.  It'll all happen, folks.  It'll all happen.</p><p>Each of us in this great arena, this arena doesn't have a roof, but a minor detail.  Problem is if you had a roof, couldn't hold this many people.  So --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are all united by the same timeless values.  We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law.  We believe in the strong borders, strong families, and a strong national defense.</p><p>We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life.  We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values.  And we believe in the words of our national motto.  In God, we trust.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans.  These are the values that unite people in the panhandle.  Panhandle.  Oh, we love the panhandle.</p><p>You all love the panhandle!  I think so.</p><p>You are incredible people.  I tell you.  You are incredible people.</p><p>You are smart, you're loyal, you are unbelievable people.</p><p>But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country, you join our movement because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of past politicians.  You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense.</p><p>The system is rigged.  I used to say it, it's still rigged, but a lot less rigged.  We are getting a rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly, folks.</p><p>You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity, and he took back your country.  You have always been loyal to this nation.  Now, you finally have a president who was loyal to you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And every day between now and the November 3rd 2020, I think of that.  November 3rd 2020.  Boy, it's close, huh?</p><p>But every day, we are going to keep on working.  We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Remember, I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me.  You'd be winning so much in the state of Florida, Governor Ron would say, president, please, in the oval office, please, we are winning too much.  We are used to this, Mr. President.  We aren't used to this.</p><p>For years and years, we've been losers.  We've been losing, Mr. President.  Now, we are winning so much.  The people of Florida cannot stand the winning so much.  Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?</p><p>And I said, no, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry.  He said, I thought you'd say that.  We're going to keep winning.  We are never going to be winning like we have now.  You've never had winning numbers.  You never had -- I think, more loyalty.</p><p>You look at what's happening to this state and you look at what's happening to this country, and we are proud again.  We are proud again.</p><p>With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand.  We are going to stand for liberty.  We are going to stand for justice.  We are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God.  We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And together, with these proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again!  We will make America strong again!  We will make America safe again!  And we will make America great again!</p><p>Thank you, Florida!  Thank you very much.</p><p>(MUSIC))</p><p>HANNITY:  All right.  You can keep the volume up.  Twelve thousand five hundred strong.  The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people.</p><p>You know, the president is right.  We do not see the crowd a lot.  Frank is our great director here.</p><p>Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside.  We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside.  Pretty big arena.  Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa.  Pretty amazing.</p><p>All right.  There you have it.  The president wrapping up.</p><p>And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over.  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.  Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once.  Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney.</p><p>Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report.  And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress.  They already had 30 hours.</p><p>The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff.  For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.  And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now.</p><p>And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.</p><p>And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.</p><p>In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?</p><p>This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19-term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un-redacted version of the Mueller report.</p><p>That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that.</p><p>Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.</p><p>The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!</p><p>Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee.</p><p>Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.</p><p>Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The subpoena is written as the beginning of a dialog process. This is a beginning of a process to talk to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice and ultimately, to go to court. But it's designed to be the foundation of a dialog and it's not designed to force our hand in what we insist on in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: This is not the first time that Nadler and his circus have been caught totally, completely, utterly contradicting himself. As it turns out, Nadler has one set of standards for his good friend Bill Clinton, remember him? Bill Clinton, the Starr report listed 11 separate felonies committed by Clinton.</p><p>He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.</p><p>They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: It's the culmination of nearly three months of requests, discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice for the complete un-redacted report by Special Counsel Mueller.</p><p>NADLER: Somebody, the staff of the Judiciary Committee, perhaps the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committee is going to have to go over this material, at least the 400 pages, 500 pages in the report to determine what is fit for release and what is, as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent, third parties, what must not be released at all.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think the President obstructed justice?</p><p>NADLER: Yes, I do. It's very clear that the President obstructed justice.</p><p>NADLER: We must not overturn an election and remove a President from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat.</p><p>NADLER: We have to protect the rule of law, and that means we have to investigate and hold hearings and layout to the American people if this Administration is involved of abuses of power or obstruction of justice.</p><p>NADLER: The American people have heard the allegations against the President and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him. They elected President Clinton; they still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Just a phony hypocrite. And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome.</p><p>Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.</p><p>So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second.</p><p>Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution. The hypocrisy of what he said then, what he's saying now.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's just amazing, Sean. I mean what we saw today is just insist for Barr (ph). They want to destroy Bill Barr because they don't like an Attorney General who actually does his job and follows the law - and follows the rules.</p><p>Think about what happened today. Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt. This is over 400 days for Eric Holder. We are less than 40. This is nothing but a political crusade to do -- mock Bill Barr, because they don't want what he is doing.</p><p>HANNITY: But Congressman, you said -- the reason they are doing it is because they fear what Barr said to Senator Lindsey Graham, which we played numerous times. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind. He has the final definitive answer there. But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront. Will it not, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: It will. And I think that's what we're seeing in the Attorney General. And what we have today is -- and again, you brought this up earlier. When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law.</p><p>You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing.</p><p>HANNITY: Congressman, last exit question in few short seconds we have. You courageously have released the closed-door testimony of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, and the General Counsel Baker and Strzok and Page. There are 53 other closed-door testimonies that I'm aware of, will you continue that release?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. Get ready for that. I would fill you by (ph). Just stay close Twitter, stay close the next few weeks. We will be releasing the rest of those.</p><p>HANNITY: Any this week, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: Probably not this week. But, we're getting ready for next week. We want to let the Democrats, their hypocrisy, shine this week. And we're going to get back in Fox what Bill Barr is doing and we're going to get back exposing this to the American people.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Congressman Collins, Georgia, thank you. Over the next weeks and months, two distinct sides are going to emerge. On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.</p><p>By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible.</p><p>And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified.</p><p>He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: The Attorney General says he believes spying occurred in looking after the President's van campaign. What do you think about that?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I have no idea what he's talking about. The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag.</p><p>DICKERSON: So the debate is a semantic one. The FBI was investigating into Trump Campaign, but you are sending they had cause to. And you just wouldn't use the word spy.</p><p>COMEY: Of course.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>HANNITY: He signed the FISA warrant that allowed -- well, based on -- we know perhaps even Russian disinformation according to The New York Times -- that allowed the spying of Carter Page. He just lied in what he said.</p><p>Now Democrats, they are running cover for Comey and everyone else who helped them perpetuate their hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories for years. And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself.</p><p>And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served.Our constitutional republic will survive.</p><p>Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.</p><p>It was you're questioning that nobody knew behind closed-doors that got us a lot more information and I can't wait to see the other 53 closed-door interviews that are coming. Good to see you both. Mark Meadows.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Good to be with you.</p><p>HANNITY: It's now beginning to unravel, the Attorney General, it's over. Mueller is dead. It's finished. They can cling as tightly as they want to their sinking ship and their conspiracy theory. But what is coming is FISA abuse, the FISA applications, the rigged investigation into Hillary, the attempt to bludgeon and undo an election, the attempts to steal an election, all now under the purview of the Attorney General and others. Where are we going with this?</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, I think in the coming days and by days, I mean just a few days, you will start to see a lot of this unravel. But as it unravels, part of why you are seeing Jerry Nadler and others go crazy is because they know that the truth is coming out.</p><p>And for as passionate as they were today and my good friend Jim Jordan did a great job in that committee hearing, but as passionate as they were today, they haven't been passionate when we've been in the privacy of those rooms, asking those questions, like Jim and I and others have. They won't even look at the documents because they don't want to know the truth.</p><p>And Director Comey, he has his day of reckoning too. He says they investigate -- we also know that they criminally leaked as well. So, it's time for accountability.</p><p>HANNITY: If the law is applied equally, do we have to go back to Hillary and the rigged investigation? By the way, you two got the information; you didn't share with me, which by the way, I deeply resent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You could have shared this information and given me exclusive. But I know, because of the closed-door testimony, number one, Lisa Page said, yes after nine months, the FBI had nothing.</p><p>But we also, Strozk and Page put all the--</p><p>JORDAN: Comey said that.</p><p>HANNITY: --FBI decisions on Hillary right inside Loretta Lynch's office. Then we've got a lot more - well we'll see what Inspector General Horowitz says, but where do you see it going? Jim Jordon?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean Comey said the same thing. All the way up to the day he was fired, he said he still had no evidence, any type of collusion, and obviously the Mueller Report demonstrated that as well.</p><p>To Jim Comey though, I mean, to not use the word spying, remember what we got last week from The New York Times. We got the - the story last Thursday where it said the FBI put a person posing as someone else to talk to George Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: Hold on Jim, you got to give the details.</p><p>JORDAN: That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: We had a 30-year-old flirtatious suggestive blonde bombshell spy trying to seduce information out of George Papadopoulos.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: You can put this in a bond movie.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. If that's not spying, tell me what is. And frankly, I did not know that anyone who actually puts much weight into what Jim Comey says now other than CNN is doing a--</p><p>HANNITY: Wait a minute, when he signed the first FISA warrant, okay wasn't that a warrant based on a dirty Russian dossier that might have been Russian disinformation according to The New York Times?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: To spy on Carter Page and the Trump Campaign? Did he not sign that, was not that on spying or am I just out of my mind?</p><p>JORDAN: We're not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEADOWS: It's worse than that. Yes, it's worse than that. He actually knew that there were credibility problems before he ever entered into it. That's the problem.</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Mark--</p><p>JORDAN: They didn't tell the court who paid - they didn't tell the court who paid for it. They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document.</p><p>HANNITY: Okay that's - by the way that would be I believe footnote eight in the dossier, in the application. Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, exactly right, Sean.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yes, all of it's been held. But I think there will be some good reporting that brings all of that to light in the very coming near future.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, both of you are in deep trouble because you kept it all from me and I hounded you to death for that information and you wouldn't give it to me.</p><p>When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter.</p><p>Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.</p><p>The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap.</p><p>SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out.</p><p>And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report.</p><p>They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law.</p><p>I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school.</p><p>HANNITY: Apparently, you would both agree, that's spying Jim. Stop lying, you have the right to remain silent, I warn you again. Guys, sorry to cut it short, don't blame me, blame the President. He took my time. Alright, more Hannity after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright unfortunately that's all the time we have for you this evening. Don't forget we will never be the rage, psychotic media mob. We are fair and balanced. Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible.</p><p>Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues.</p><p>I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224436096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W58-13T1-JBHT-D3F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

And they say, no, no, he's the one that causes that fight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And he comes in and he talks about his country, but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up, flying the national flag of their country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, if he's so afraid of his country, why is he flying the flag of the country, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  My opening monologue coming up in just a minute.</p><p>But, first, we go right back to the president.  He is in Panama City Beach at a rally in Florida.  Stay with us.</p><p>TRUMP:  -- our border, save that flag, we love our country.  We love our country but we're afraid of it.  For purposes of getting into the United States, we are afraid of our country.</p><p>Now, we can't let this happen.  The Democrats, we need the votes.  We need the votes.  Otherwise, you are going to have to vote them out of office -- Congress, the Senate, you're going to have to vote them out of office.  Come November, next November, November 3rd next year, you're going to have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can't make a chase.  We need the votes.  We have to go through Congress.</p><p>However, we ended with this is incredible.  But they don't mind it so much because they do not mind crime.  They don't mind crime.  No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad plan to protect and defend American's borders.  They shouldn't be allowed to run.</p><p>And to confront this crisis -- you saw that!  It was a big deal two months ago.  I declared a national emergency, which is what it is.  This is an invasion.</p><p>When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion.  I was badly criticized for using the word \"invasion.\"  It's an invasion.</p><p>And it's also in the invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico, OK?  It's an invasion of drugs.  They all better be careful, because, you know, we are destroying the lives of hundreds and thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border.  They better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now.</p><p>They have drug dens and drug labs in factories right along the border.  They make the crack right there and send it over our border what we don't have walls.  They drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific, 2,000 miles!</p><p>Now, a lot of it, you don't need the wall because its mountains, big strong rivers, it's snake country.  Nobody's walking to certain areas.  You've got to like snakes a lot.</p><p>It's a rough country.  But what we need and what we have done, but they can't do this.  They can't let this happen.  We've been very tough with them, I will be honest.</p><p>Mexico made $100 billion on average over the past ten years, 100 billion!  They took 30 percent -- almost -- of our automobile business.  We make cars.  They send them to the United States.  That won't happen anymore under the USMCA.  It will be prohibited.  It'll be economically prohibited.</p><p>Our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border policies from being swiftly returned home.  A border crosser comes in, you say, sorry, we are taking your home.  That sounds nice.  I want to do that, OK?</p><p>But we are the only one that has judges.  Judges -- think about it.  They come across, they have judges.  Nobody else has judges.  We give them a trial.  We need Perry Mason.  It's crazy.  Folks, it's crazy.</p><p>And then they say, and the wall would help.  It would not help, but the wall would stop it.  When you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people, and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great -- and don't forget, we don't let them and we can't let them use weapons but we can't.  Other countries do.  We can't.  I would never do that.</p><p>But how do you stop these people?  You can't.  There's -- that's only in the panhandle you can get away with that, folks.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Only in the panhandle!  So it's a tough situation.  But if they change the loopholes, we'll have it perfectly.  When the wall is finished, it's going to be great.  Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.  They are protected.</p><p>Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws.  We must end catch-and-release.  Stop human smugglers.</p><p>Have you seen what's happening?  Human smugglers, human traffickers -- have you seen what they are doing?  This is an ancient thing.  It's an ancient crime.</p><p>It's bigger now because of the computer, the Internet than ever before, worldwide!  Not just here, worldwide, and most come through our southern border where we don't have a wall.  They don't go through ports of entry -- you have people looking inside the cars.  You can't do that.</p><p>If you have women tied up with tape over their mouths, you can take them through a port of entry.  And a lot of these people say, they come to the ports -- they don't come through the port.  They come to areas where you don't have the wall.  Fifteen miles up, make a left.</p><p>We've got to shut down century cities.  Deport criminal aliens and replace the visa lottery, the chain migration, with a modern system of immigration.  We have to do it.</p><p>On issue after issue, the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mainstream.  It's never been.  I've never been that I've never heard of anything like what's going on.  I want to run so badly.  I want to don't make this race to start immediately.</p><p>Now, Democrats are pushing a $100 trillion takeover of the U.S. economy, known as the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>That was written up by a real genius.</p><p>The Democrat Party believes in socialism.  Take a look at Venezuela.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>Republicans believe in freedom.  We need to get senators elected.  We need to get the votes.  We need congressmen and women elected, Republicans, we need to get the votes.</p><p>You've got to get out of there.  You got to work.  Otherwise we'll be playing around for too long.</p><p>And Democrats are aggressively pushing late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mothers' wombs, right up until the moment of birth.</p><p>And then you have this governor in Virginia, you saw that?  The baby is born, and you wrap the baby beautifully, and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby.  Oh, can't do that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>So who heard of that one, that came up and that's now something -- and they don't even want to discuss it.  They don't even want to discuss it.</p><p>And to protect innocent life, I call on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late-term abortion.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts, and delusions.</p><p>The Republican Party is the party for all Americans.  We want to make America great again.  That's what we are doing.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>Will you please show these people?  I go home, you know, you hear it.  You hear it.  You can hear how many people.  But they never show it.  They don't want to do it.</p><p>It's like in Florida or Florida State football game, isn't it?</p><p>We are the party of the American worker, the American family, and we are the party of the American dream.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every day we are making very, very good on our motto.  In fact, much better than we promise.  And you know what it is?  Its promises made, promises kept.</p><p>We've actually given you more promises.  My opponents said this.  They weren't happy about this.</p><p>But we've given you more promises than we said we would do.  That's very unusual for politicians.  That may be a first.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants, big tech must not censor conservative or other voices.</p><p>We are also taking steps to address judicial overreach, activist judges whose issue -- that's right.  You know about that, right?  We did a big thing.</p><p>And the Democrats hate that I did this, because you know who started this in reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president.  Because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.</p><p>Take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform.  Nobody thought it could be done.  And we passed it.  And it's tough as hill, but it's also fair.  It's fair.</p><p>That's why we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as it's written, and we just confirmed -- listen to this, our 100th federal judge.  We'll be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges.</p><p>We've got to go great Supreme Court judges, what a difference having him appear makes you feel good about your country, doesn't it?  It makes you really go to got your country.</p><p>We've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  We are doing big.  Last year, prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years.  Just today, we announced that the drug companies will be required by law to include prices in television advertisement, first time.  It's going to drive the price down.</p><p>And we are vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House, the Senate, the presidency again.</p><p>And we will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, always.  The Republican Party will always protect patience with pre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions.  And for the veterans, we passed V.A. Choice, right?</p><p>So, now, as they wait in line for three weeks, ten days, four days, two months, people who weren't even very sick, the terminally ill, before they get to see a doctor?  They immediately go outside, find a good local doctor, get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill, and it's a great thing for our veterans and trying to get it passed for 44 years, we've got it passed.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we also passed -- 46 years they've been trying -- V.A. accountability.  Because under the V.A., you couldn't fire anybody.  They were terrible to our great vets, they could be sadistic, they could steal, they could rob, they could do anything -- we had no way of firing these people.</p><p>Now, we passed V.A. accountability.  They don't treat our vets right?  Boom.  You are fired.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Forty-six years they tried to get that.  It's a little hard working -- I mean, in that case, it was against the union, against civil service, not too easy.</p><p>We are unlocking American energy.  The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  One.</p><p>We are slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects.  We had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved.  We brought it way down.  We are trying to make it one year.  We are close to getting that.  We are down to two or three at the most.</p><p>This was taken 21 -- there was a certain road and a certain state.  They were working on it for 21 years.  It costs hundreds of times more money.</p><p>It used to be a straight line, now it's a line like this.  You had a couple of drinks?  You had a very bad shot of making it home.</p><p>It cost a fortune, 21 years.  Now we are trying to get it down to one year.  Maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons.  That's OK.  But you have people who worked on projects almost their entire life.  And then they go to a vote on some counsel and they lose three to two?</p><p>Now, you may get rejected, it's going to take a year, year and a half, but mostly, you're not going to get rejected.  It's going to be done in a really good way.  So, we are trying to get that permitting process down for roads, for highways, for bridges, for tunnels, for everything.  There's no reason you should be taking 20 years.</p><p>And as promised, we've directed more than half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee.  Herbert Hoover dike.  Everybody wanted that done.</p><p>Your governor, both your governors -- your last governor and your current governor wanted that done.  So, we have the Army Corps of Engineers, they're doing a fantastic job and they're getting it done.  It'll now be completed in three years, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule.  I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible.</p><p>Earlier this year, I signed legislation providing $100 million to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions, especially in Florida.  The red tide.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It doesn't look too inviting.  I come down to Florida.  I say, what the hell is that?  The red tide.  So, we are going to get rid of it.</p><p>And to keep America safe, we are rebuilding America's military might like never before, including $133 million for the gulf coast test range.</p><p>Do you know what that is, gulf?  Anybody there?  Anybody like practice shooting?  Trust me, it's a good thing for you folks.  You don't have to shoot.</p><p>It's a good thing, $133 million, the military needs it so badly.  It's going to be very quickly completed, and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job.</p><p>As an example, at Eglin Air Force Base.  Eglin.  Eglin.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great people.</p><p>And we have made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrifice our sovereignty, surrendered our jobs, and tied us down to endless foreign wars.  I do not know if you saw it, but about eight weeks ago, we took 100 percent of the caliphate.  It was supposed to take two years in Syria -- ISIS.</p><p>That doesn't mean they are going to go around.  These people are stone cold crazy.  It doesn't mean that they will go around blowing up a store and blowing up something.  They are just nuts.</p><p>But we took 100 percent.  When I took over this helm, this great country, we were way behind.  I showed you the map.  It was all -- so much ISIS.  And within a short period of time, we wiped it out, the caliphate.  We had 100 percent.</p><p>But still.  Still.  It's a mental condition.  These people are stick.  They are crazy.  They are crazy.</p><p>So always keep your eyes open, be careful.  And let law enforcement go when you see a kook.  Let them know, because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth.</p><p>And everything we do, we are now putting America first.  For years, we lost in so many different ways.  We were losing on trade.  We were getting beaten by people in countries that had no chance.</p><p>We were insisting that no NATO members -- you had to see this.  The NATO folks, they don't pay their fair share they were supposed to pay.  We were taking over and sending almost 100 percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO, which is Europe.</p><p>And I said, that's not right.  On top of that, the E.U. absolutely kills us on trade.  It's all changing, folks.  $100 billion extra was just given by those countries that's now pouring into NATO, because I said, you've got to pay off.</p><p>Your past presidents would go meet them and wouldn't talk about it or say, gee, whenever you get a chance, maybe you could pay up.  You've got to see.  It was like a chart this way.</p><p>Now, it's like a rocket ship the other way.  They are paying up, $100 million, they pay.  $100 billion with a B.</p><p>Last month, I announce that my administration is unsigning the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which is great for your Second Amendment.  We love our Second Amendment.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>And we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment, and your rights under the Second Amendment.</p><p>I also withdrew the United States from the horrible he Iran the nuclear deal.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And, unfortunately, just today, I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran's iron, aluminum, and copper industries because I hope to be able to at some point, maybe it won't happen, possibly won't, to sit down and work out a fair deal.</p><p>We're not looking to hurt anybody.  We want a fair deal.  We just don't want them to have nuclear weapons.  That's all we want.</p><p>I recognized Israel's capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And just two weeks ago, I announced the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  That's a big deal.</p><p>And as rockets rained down on Israel, we reaffirmed America's solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror.  They have done just a great job.</p><p>It's a dangerous place.  The Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>We also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemn the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And our hearts are united with you people of Venezuela, and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight, the people of Cuba, and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free.  It'll all happen, folks.  It'll all happen.</p><p>Each of us in this great arena, this arena doesn't have a roof, but a minor detail.  Problem is if you had a roof, couldn't hold this many people.  So --</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We are all united by the same timeless values.  We believe in the American Constitution and we believe in the rule of law.  We believe in the strong borders, strong families, and a strong national defense.</p><p>We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life.  We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>We believe that mothers and fathers, not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great country's values.  And we believe in the words of our national motto.  In God, we trust.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>These are the traditions, customs, and principles that bind us together as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans.  These are the values that unite people in the panhandle.  Panhandle.  Oh, we love the panhandle.</p><p>You all love the panhandle!  I think so.</p><p>You are incredible people.  I tell you.  You are incredible people.</p><p>You are smart, you're loyal, you are unbelievable people.</p><p>But all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country, you join our movement because you rejected the failures and the betrayals of past politicians.  You stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense.</p><p>The system is rigged.  I used to say it, it's still rigged, but a lot less rigged.  We are getting a rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly, folks.</p><p>You reclaim your destiny, you defended your dignity, and he took back your country.  You have always been loyal to this nation.  Now, you finally have a president who was loyal to you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And every day between now and the November 3rd 2020, I think of that.  November 3rd 2020.  Boy, it's close, huh?</p><p>But every day, we are going to keep on working.  We're going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>Remember, I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me.  You'd be winning so much in the state of Florida, Governor Ron would say, president, please, in the oval office, please, we are winning too much.  We are used to this, Mr. President.  We aren't used to this.</p><p>For years and years, we've been losers.  We've been losing, Mr. President.  Now, we are winning so much.  The people of Florida cannot stand the winning so much.  Can you maybe pull it back a little bit, Mr. President?</p><p>And I said, no, I can't, Ron, I'm sorry.  He said, I thought you'd say that.  We're going to keep winning.  We are never going to be winning like we have now.  You've never had winning numbers.  You never had -- I think, more loyalty.</p><p>You look at what's happening to this state and you look at what's happening to this country, and we are proud again.  We are proud again.</p><p>With every last ounce of heart and hope and sweat and soul, we are going to make our stand.  We are going to stand for liberty.  We are going to stand for justice.  We are going to stand for faith, family, and freedom.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And we are going to stand for the sacred rights given to us by the hand of Almighty God.  We are one united movement, one united people, and one United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>And together, with these proud people of the Panhandle, the proud people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again!  We will make America strong again!  We will make America safe again!  And we will make America great again!</p><p>Thank you, Florida!  Thank you very much.</p><p>(MUSIC))</p><p>HANNITY:  All right.  You can keep the volume up.  Twelve thousand five hundred strong.  The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people.</p><p>You know, the president is right.  We do not see the crowd a lot.  Frank is our great director here.</p><p>Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside.  We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside.  Pretty big arena.  Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa.  Pretty amazing.</p><p>All right.  There you have it.  The president wrapping up.</p><p>And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over.  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.  Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once.  Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney.</p><p>Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report.  And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress.  They already had 30 hours.</p><p>The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff.  For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.  And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now.</p><p>And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.</p><p>And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.</p><p>In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction.</p><p>Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?</p><p>This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19-term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un-redacted version of the Mueller report.</p><p>That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that.</p><p>Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.</p><p>The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!</p><p>Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee.</p><p>Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.</p><p>Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The subpoena is written as the beginning of a dialog process. This is a beginning of a process to talk to the Attorney General and to the Department of Justice and ultimately, to go to court. But it's designed to be the foundation of a dialog and it's not designed to force our hand in what we insist on in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: This is not the first time that Nadler and his circus have been caught totally, completely, utterly contradicting himself. As it turns out, Nadler has one set of standards for his good friend Bill Clinton, remember him? Bill Clinton, the Starr report listed 11 separate felonies committed by Clinton.</p><p>He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.</p><p>They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: It's the culmination of nearly three months of requests, discussions and negotiations with the Department of Justice for the complete un-redacted report by Special Counsel Mueller.</p><p>NADLER: Somebody, the staff of the Judiciary Committee, perhaps the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the Judiciary Committee is going to have to go over this material, at least the 400 pages, 500 pages in the report to determine what is fit for release and what is, as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights, people who may be totally innocent, third parties, what must not be released at all.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you think the President obstructed justice?</p><p>NADLER: Yes, I do. It's very clear that the President obstructed justice.</p><p>NADLER: We must not overturn an election and remove a President from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat.</p><p>NADLER: We have to protect the rule of law, and that means we have to investigate and hold hearings and layout to the American people if this Administration is involved of abuses of power or obstruction of justice.</p><p>NADLER: The American people have heard the allegations against the President and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him. They elected President Clinton; they still support him. We have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANNITY: Just a phony hypocrite. And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome.</p><p>Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.</p><p>So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second.</p><p>Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution. The hypocrisy of what he said then, what he's saying now.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's just amazing, Sean. I mean what we saw today is just insist for Barr (ph). They want to destroy Bill Barr because they don't like an Attorney General who actually does his job and follows the law - and follows the rules.</p><p>Think about what happened today. Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt. This is over 400 days for Eric Holder. We are less than 40. This is nothing but a political crusade to do -- mock Bill Barr, because they don't want what he is doing.</p><p>HANNITY: But Congressman, you said -- the reason they are doing it is because they fear what Barr said to Senator Lindsey Graham, which we played numerous times. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind. He has the final definitive answer there. But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront. Will it not, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: It will. And I think that's what we're seeing in the Attorney General. And what we have today is -- and again, you brought this up earlier. When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law.</p><p>You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing.</p><p>HANNITY: Congressman, last exit question in few short seconds we have. You courageously have released the closed-door testimony of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, and the General Counsel Baker and Strzok and Page. There are 53 other closed-door testimonies that I'm aware of, will you continue that release?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. Get ready for that. I would fill you by (ph). Just stay close Twitter, stay close the next few weeks. We will be releasing the rest of those.</p><p>HANNITY: Any this week, sir?</p><p>COLLINS: Probably not this week. But, we're getting ready for next week. We want to let the Democrats, their hypocrisy, shine this week. And we're going to get back in Fox what Bill Barr is doing and we're going to get back exposing this to the American people.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Congressman Collins, Georgia, thank you. Over the next weeks and months, two distinct sides are going to emerge. On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.</p><p>By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible.</p><p>And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified.</p><p>He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: The Attorney General says he believes spying occurred in looking after the President's van campaign. What do you think about that?</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: I have no idea what he's talking about. The FBI doesn't spy. The FBI investigates. We investigated a very serious allegation that Americans might be hooked up with the Russian effort to attack our democracy. The Republicans need to breathe into a paper bag.</p><p>DICKERSON: So the debate is a semantic one. The FBI was investigating into Trump Campaign, but you are sending they had cause to. And you just wouldn't use the word spy.</p><p>COMEY: Of course.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>HANNITY: He signed the FISA warrant that allowed -- well, based on -- we know perhaps even Russian disinformation according to The New York Times -- that allowed the spying of Carter Page. He just lied in what he said.</p><p>Now Democrats, they are running cover for Comey and everyone else who helped them perpetuate their hoax, their lies, their conspiracy theories for years. And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself.</p><p>And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served.Our constitutional republic will survive.</p><p>Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.</p><p>It was you're questioning that nobody knew behind closed-doors that got us a lot more information and I can't wait to see the other 53 closed-door interviews that are coming. Good to see you both. Mark Meadows.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Good to be with you.</p><p>HANNITY: It's now beginning to unravel, the Attorney General, it's over. Mueller is dead. It's finished. They can cling as tightly as they want to their sinking ship and their conspiracy theory. But what is coming is FISA abuse, the FISA applications, the rigged investigation into Hillary, the attempt to bludgeon and undo an election, the attempts to steal an election, all now under the purview of the Attorney General and others. Where are we going with this?</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC): Well, I think in the coming days and by days, I mean just a few days, you will start to see a lot of this unravel. But as it unravels, part of why you are seeing Jerry Nadler and others go crazy is because they know that the truth is coming out.</p><p>And for as passionate as they were today and my good friend Jim Jordan did a great job in that committee hearing, but as passionate as they were today, they haven't been passionate when we've been in the privacy of those rooms, asking those questions, like Jim and I and others have. They won't even look at the documents because they don't want to know the truth.</p><p>And Director Comey, he has his day of reckoning too. He says they investigate -- we also know that they criminally leaked as well. So, it's time for accountability.</p><p>HANNITY: If the law is applied equally, do we have to go back to Hillary and the rigged investigation? By the way, you two got the information; you didn't share with me, which by the way, I deeply resent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You could have shared this information and given me exclusive. But I know, because of the closed-door testimony, number one, Lisa Page said, yes after nine months, the FBI had nothing.</p><p>But we also, Strozk and Page put all the--</p><p>JORDAN: Comey said that.</p><p>HANNITY: --FBI decisions on Hillary right inside Loretta Lynch's office. Then we've got a lot more - well we'll see what Inspector General Horowitz says, but where do you see it going? Jim Jordon?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean Comey said the same thing. All the way up to the day he was fired, he said he still had no evidence, any type of collusion, and obviously the Mueller Report demonstrated that as well.</p><p>To Jim Comey though, I mean, to not use the word spying, remember what we got last week from The New York Times. We got the - the story last Thursday where it said the FBI put a person posing as someone else to talk to George Papadopoulos in the Trump campaign. That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: Hold on Jim, you got to give the details.</p><p>JORDAN: That's called spying.</p><p>HANNITY: We had a 30-year-old flirtatious suggestive blonde bombshell spy trying to seduce information out of George Papadopoulos.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: You can put this in a bond movie.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. If that's not spying, tell me what is. And frankly, I did not know that anyone who actually puts much weight into what Jim Comey says now other than CNN is doing a--</p><p>HANNITY: Wait a minute, when he signed the first FISA warrant, okay wasn't that a warrant based on a dirty Russian dossier that might have been Russian disinformation according to The New York Times?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>HANNITY: To spy on Carter Page and the Trump Campaign? Did he not sign that, was not that on spying or am I just out of my mind?</p><p>JORDAN: We're not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEADOWS: It's worse than that. Yes, it's worse than that. He actually knew that there were credibility problems before he ever entered into it. That's the problem.</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Mark--</p><p>JORDAN: They didn't tell the court who paid - they didn't tell the court who paid for it. They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document.</p><p>HANNITY: Okay that's - by the way that would be I believe footnote eight in the dossier, in the application. Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes, exactly right, Sean.</p><p>MEADOWS: Yes, all of it's been held. But I think there will be some good reporting that brings all of that to light in the very coming near future.</p><p>HANNITY: By the way, both of you are in deep trouble because you kept it all from me and I hounded you to death for that information and you wouldn't give it to me.</p><p>When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter.</p><p>Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.</p><p>The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap.</p><p>SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out.</p><p>And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report.</p><p>They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law.</p><p>I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--</p><p>HANNITY: Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school.</p><p>HANNITY: Apparently, you would both agree, that's spying Jim. Stop lying, you have the right to remain silent, I warn you again. Guys, sorry to cut it short, don't blame me, blame the President. He took my time. Alright, more Hannity after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HANNITY: Alright unfortunately that's all the time we have for you this evening. Don't forget we will never be the rage, psychotic media mob. We are fair and balanced. Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible.</p><p>Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues.</p><p>I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2224436096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB1-BBY1-JBHT-D3GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
