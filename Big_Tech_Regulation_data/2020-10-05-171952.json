De series all square on 2-2. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. New laws will be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will have to obtain \"explicit\" consent. Here's our Political Correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities. There is your photo going up online, your tweet, your search, the search results. But then there is a whole back office, which is the industry of data capture, data processing. That data is processed and it is then that the insights are shared with advertisers, principally. Our digital footprints are growing ever larger. Ministers say data protection laws must keep pace. Leila Nathoo, BBC News. Our Technology Correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is here. Potentially this could affect millions of people. It is huge, what we are effectively saying is the European General data protection regulations and the huge piece of legislation agreed a year or so ago coming in next May and effectively the government has decided to cut and paste it and put it into British law so it continues after we leave the EU. The decision has been made that this harmonisation of data protection laws across Europe will continue. It is a harmonisation, an update but also a real toughening up, particularly in relation to this giant American tech companies who are being told that if they want to</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-0b0ef082aa604e5ca08b883506f70990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P68-RS41-JBH6-C1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

The government says people should have greater control over online personal data. Provisions in the upcoming Data Protection Bill will make it easier for people to withdraw consent for information to be used. But some question whether everything can be erased. Also this lunchtime... North Korea warns America it will \"pay the price\" for drafting tough new UN sanctions over its missile and nuclear weapons programme. </p><p>A British model who says she was kidnapped for six days in Italy returns to the UK, saying she feared for her life \"second by second.\" I've been through a terrifying experience. I feared for my life second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour. I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release. The police watchdog in Scotland wants to know why it took more than a month to find the body of a missing man who all the time was in his own home. In her first interview since becoming the next Dr Who, Jodie Whittaker says being a female Time Lord is a proud honour. I hope, you know my gender isn't a fearful thing for the fans. Because in this world, particularly, there aren't rules and that's a great thing. And on Look North in half an hour: Athletes arrive in Sheffield for the four-day Special Olympics which get under way tomorrow. And we look back at Leeds Pride weekend - dubbed the biggest and best yet. series all square on 2-2. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. New laws will be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will have to obtain \"explicit\" consent. Here's our Political Correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities.

And in the South: Carrier Countdown - Portsmouth's told Britain's biggest ever warship could arrive in just ten days' time. And the Dorset bride whose engagement ring was stolen on her wedding day. </p><p>Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. New laws will be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will have to obtain \"explicit\" consent. Here's our Political Correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities. There is your photo going up online, your tweet, your search, the search results. But then there is a whole back office, which is the industry of data capture, data processing. That data is processed and it is then that the insights are shared with advertisers, principally. Our digital footprints are growing ever larger. Ministers say data protection laws must keep pace. Leila Nathoo, BBC News. Our Technology Correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is here. Potentially this could affect millions of people. It is huge, what we are effectively saying is the European General data protection regulations and the huge piece of legislation agreed a year or so ago coming in next May and effectively the government has decided to cut and paste it and put it into British law so it continues after we leave the EU. The decision has been made that this harmonisation of data protection laws across Europe will continue. It is a harmonisation, an update but also a real toughening up, particularly in relation to this giant American tech companies who are being told that if they want to process our data and move it across borders, they have to give us much more control over it. For those businesses, smaller ones that rely on moving peoples data around and improving their bottom line by using it, how will they be effected? This have a huge effect on them. For the last six months Mike inbox filled up with people wanting to advise small businesses on how to cope with this new regulation. They will have to be awake to it, there are big and damaging fine that could affect them. In all sorts of areas. They have to be careful about data breaches, telling people about them and being more responsible with data and in general about what consumers want from that data. Many thanks. North Korea says it will make America \"pay the price\" for drafting tough new UN sanctions over its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The state news agency says the international community is infringing North Korea's sovereignty. The UN's unanimous vote on sanctions follows repeated missile tests by Pyongyang which have escalated tensions across east Asia. Yogita Limaye reports from the South Korean capital, Seoul. It contains some flash photography.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-1964924a54f545909f212b7fd1298714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P68-RS41-JBH6-C1K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

And in the South: Carrier Countdown - Portsmouth's told Britain's biggest ever warship could arrive in just ten days' time. And the Dorset bride whose engagement ring was stolen on her wedding day. </p><p>Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. New laws will be introduced, giving people greater control over what happens to their online personal data. The government says the legislation offers \"the right to be forgotten,\" with proposals in the Data Protection Bill making it easier to withdraw consent for information to be used. Companies will have to obtain \"explicit\" consent. Here's our Political Correspondent, Leila Nathoo. Our lives are led online. We all leave a digital trail. But what happens to all the information we upload about ourselves? A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom will retain its world-class regime of protecting personal data. Now we will have more control, data protection laws are being strengthened. The government has confirmed a bill will be published in the autumn, bringing EU regulations due to come in next year onto the statute book. Internet users will be given more powers to protect their data. It will be easier for people to find out what information organisations hold about them and allow them to ask for data to be deleted. Firms will no longer be able to rely on pre-selected tick boxes. Instead, explicit consent will be required to collect personal details. And the information watchdog will be given more powers to issue fines of up to #17 million for serious data breaches. I think there are a lot of pitfalls ahead if actually the benefit of this, which is people feeling far more comfortable transacting online and their data is going to be protected, will work. I think it's a good first step to have the regulation in place. It's how it gets implemented that's the key thing. The new rules won't only apply to the big tech companies and social media giants. They will affect every organisation that processes information online. And the definition of personal data is being expanded, too, to include things like IP addresses to help safeguard identities. There is your photo going up online, your tweet, your search, the search results. But then there is a whole back office, which is the industry of data capture, data processing. That data is processed and it is then that the insights are shared with advertisers, principally. Our digital footprints are growing ever larger. Ministers say data protection laws must keep pace. Leila Nathoo, BBC News. Our Technology Correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is here. Potentially this could affect millions of people. It is huge, what we are effectively saying is the European General data protection regulations and the huge piece of legislation agreed a year or so ago coming in next May and effectively the government has decided to cut and paste it and put it into British law so it continues after we leave the EU. The decision has been made that this harmonisation of data protection laws across Europe will continue. It is a harmonisation, an update but also a real toughening up, particularly in relation to this giant American tech companies who are being told that if they want to process our data and move it across borders, they have to give us much more control over it. For those businesses, smaller ones that rely on moving peoples data around and improving their bottom line by using it, how will they be effected? This have a huge effect on them. For the last six months Mike inbox filled up with people wanting to advise small businesses on how to cope with this new regulation. They will have to be awake to it, there are big and damaging fine that could affect them. In all sorts of areas. They have to be careful about data breaches, telling people about them and being more responsible with data and in general about what consumers want from that data. Many thanks. North Korea says it will make America \"pay the price\" for drafting tough new UN sanctions over its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The state news agency says the international community is infringing North Korea's sovereignty. The UN's unanimous vote on sanctions follows repeated missile tests by Pyongyang which have escalated tensions across east Asia. Yogita Limaye reports from the South Korean capital, Seoul. It contains some flash photography.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-312ecbde5b414538903d166cf9a6f9ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P68-RS41-JBH6-C1J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TVEyes, Inc.

These tactics by the railroads sold fury and despair. There were investigations the document these problems and enacted legislative solutions to help these practices in the railroad industry and others dominated by unregulated monopolies and trusts. Importantly, legislative reforms during this period did not prevent the arrival of new technology for human progress. </p><p>Instead, Congress recognised that these powerful new technologies had reshaped the balance of power in our economy and that it was the role of Congress to ensure that the new monopolists did not abuse the power stop today the digital economy holds a similar challenge. All the underlying technology is dramatically different but new digital intermediaries have the ability to control access to critical markets. If you are an independent merchant, developer or content producer you are increasingly reliant on these powerful intermediaries to access markets and consumers. Across the economy, many businesses live in fear of exclusion from these platforms. The fact that some companies have shared with the committee over the past year during this investigation. The subcommittee current review of competition in the digital marketplace continues a long tradition of this committee of oversight of the anti-trust laws and our economy. From the days of Germany manual seller, and the subcommittee has conduct careful inquiries into industrial sectors showing signs of consolidation and anti-competitive conduct. This is continued on a bipartisan basis over the years from German books, and others. As a 1930 report from the then named set committee on monopoly power described \"It is the province of the subcommittee to investigate factors which tended to eliminate competition, strengthen monopolies, in small businesses will promote on your concentration of economic power. To ascertain the facts and make recommendations based on those findings.\" Following that calculation will have dealings with industry and government witnesses, in a careful and at times painstaking review of large lines of evidence provided by industry participants and regulators. Ultimately there is the responsibility of the anti-trust enforcement agencies to enforce the law. But Congress has an obligation to assess whether existing anti-trust and competition policies and a bill to enforce them are adequate to address the competition issues facing our country, and to take action if they are fun to be lacking. Given the dominant Romans four companies play in our economy and society, it is only reasonable that our careful examination of the anti-trust laws begins with them. I appreciate the participation of witnesses today. Our investigation will not be complete, indeed it would hardly be done, without hearing directly from the decision-makers of these companies and I look forward to their testimony and very discussion. I thank the gentleman, and I now recognise the gentleman from Ohio, Mr Jordan, for his opening statements. Thank you, and I want to thank the opening member, I'm not sure how many hearings the subcommittee will have this Congress what I want to thank Jim for his great work for the constituents of his district in Wisconsin for this many years for the work he has done for this entire committee.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-242f1048f09f4888a598b962f84f3c2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-3444-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-041b522de52e4fd8beb3d47765e26bda</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-342N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-826b400d8758439682a48e5003f6323c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-342R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.

With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-118e538305164522ae61785de02f639d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-3423-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-213c56978d4544fda68254db76ef4121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-342W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-a6f7a9f53911439d810f684446a19cfc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-3420-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement.

Or maybe you prefer the more authoritarian approach of China, which has its own tech giants. Facebook, and Sir Nick Clegg, are betting that the next and best internet is more regulated and more European. His first speech was in Brussels in January. </p><p>Today, he was in Berlin. This morning, he strongly refuted claims that, as with America's presidential election, Facebook was abused by foreign actors during the Brexit referendum campaign. We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There is a lot of weight in that word \"significant\". Of course, Facebook themselves don't always know everything about who is advertising on their platform. The most striking claim today from Clegg is that Facebook actively seeks regulation in areas such as privacy, election advertising and hate speech. I don't think it's actually right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society and, in the end, this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own. Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News. One of the biggest names on the British High Street, Boots, is to replace all of its plastic bags with brown paper ones. The change will be brought in at a small number of stores immediately, before being rolled out across the chain by early next year. Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-2540c8d1a9544770af5d39599ee05448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-340K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Our consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith is in Preston for us. George, this is the result of a storm that kicked off for migratory a couple of weeks ago after customers began complaining that even prescriptions were being given out in plastic bags. It is an issue the public are very conscious of at the moment. Just last year, 1.75 billion plastic bags were bought in England alone and that is not including the hundreds of thousands extra bought in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and so migratory are wanting to combat that negative publicity and act first, so they have announced today that the plastic bags, which cost between five and 10p, will be replaced with paper ones and all of their stores from the start of next year. But there is a real debate about whether paper bags are any better for the environment, because they can go soggy and break more easily and the Environment Agency have actually said recently that paper bags are unlikely to be able to be used frequently enough, or reused frequently enough, to justify the extra cost used in making the bags in the first place. Boots, though, say 900 tonnes of plastic bags will be removed from the system in this one move and lots of other companies are doing something similar at the moment. We have seen Morrison say they are going to introduced paper bags, the Co-op say they are introducing biodegradable bags across their stores, so although Boots are the latest company to act, given the amount of public pressure on this issue at the moment, they are unlikely to be the last. Thank you. The sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau says he is disappointed that an online crowdfunding campaign to support him has been closed down. The 30-year-old had his contract terminated after posting homophobic messages on social media. More than #400,000 had been raised before they go fund me website closed the account, saying it would issue refunds to all donors. Football, and Newcastle United says its manager Rafael Benitez will leave the club when his contract expires on the 30th of June - after both sides failed to reach an agreement. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid boss Benitez joined Newcastle in March 2016.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-41cb6dd6e5474410a4cbab0b1734f8b3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-JXX1-DY08-33YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We have shared all of this information with the Select Committee at Westminster and elsewhere, we have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.

Sceptics will argue Facebook is trying to pre-empt global regulation before its political enemies demand it is broken up. And while the idea of an oversight board is intriguing, it's not at all clear how it would deal with a potentially vast number of complaints or maintain its independence. Sir Nick said the company has substantially reduced the number of pictures of self-harm on Instagram, one of its platforms, following the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian said his daughter took her life after exposure to such pictures. The talk today was of a \"tech-lash\", a backlash against California tech giants which Facebook says has gone too far. Others think it hasn't gone far enough. Let us not become complacent. This is not over yet. We have a lot of work to do as citizens, as human beings and as a democratic society. To harness and outlaw the idea that our private experience can be their free raw material for a new kind of capitalism that is all about us but is not for us. With almost half of humanity not yet online, Facebook and Sir Nick want to shape the future of the internet before China does. Amol Rajan, BBC News.

Here's our social affairs should have been a place where Whorlton Hall in County Durham people with learning disabilities and autism receive the care they need it but year an undercover Panorama investigation exposed a disturbing culture that allowed the bullying and intimidation of patients like Alex. If you carry on screaming... Alex is terrified of men but, when she got upset, her female care staff were sent away. Her screams could be heard down the corridor. But the signs of a disturbing culture at Whorlton Hall were picked up by one of the CQC's inspection teams, led by Barry Stanley-Wilkinson, four years earlier, but their findings were not published and today's enquiry says that was wrong. I observing and finding that rooms were being used to seclude people where there were no seclusion policies in place. The general lack of staff understanding on how to work with people that had significant, challenging needs was of real concern. A very experienced inspector, he complained about the failure to publish his report, but eventually felt forced out of his job. I was literally made to feel worthless, I was made to feel incompetent, I was made to feel like I actually didn't know how to do my job at all. Today's independent report for the CQC concluded, while the 2015 inspection saw no actual abuse, it found numerous areas of serious concern and feelings.

They have to make sure something happens this time it's got to be seen, we have to see some sort of improvement. If they don't do something, what will happen? In another four years, you will be sitting in someone else's house with their child in the same situation.

I observing and finding that rooms were being used to seclude people where there were no seclusion policies in place. The general lack of staff understanding on how to work with people that had significant, challenging needs was of real concern.

Our economics editor, Faisal Islam, reports from Davos in Switzerland where the argument came to a head.

It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

President Trump was finally able to deliver his annual State of the Union address last night after it was delayed because of the US government shutdown. The president spoke of unity and co-operation, but also brought up some of the big issues that divide America, like immigration and abortion. Our correspondent Nick Bryant watched the speech and joins us now. George, this was the State of the Union address that almost didn't happen, and Donald Trump made news by announcing he will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam for their second summit later in the month, but there's still no sign of</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-babe4b2f12c14405a3dbe38898b1cca8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC5-S5S1-JBH6-C1PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. </p><p>We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at the station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News.

It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\".

New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at the station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

President Trump was finally able to deliver his annual State of the Union address last night after it was delayed because of the US government shutdown. The president spoke of unity and co-operation, but also brought up some of the big issues that divide America, like immigration and abortion. Our correspondent Nick Bryant watched the speech and joins us now. George, this was the State of the Union address that almost didn't happen, and Donald Trump made news by announcing he will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam for their second summit later in the month, but there's still no sign of political peace raking out at home. -- breaking out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-b8518e2008cf427abe29dbe6a375b1aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VC5-S5S1-JBH6-C1SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at the station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here As Angus s report made clear, to look at how this might work. to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it s not clear that old laws to the digital revolution. Today, are much use when it comes identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook s purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It s too crude, as it were, But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe s new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online ? and who should be responsible? In Germany, they ve modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today s public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

President Trump was finally able to deliver his annual State of the Union address last night after it was delayed because of the US government shutdown. The president spoke of unity and co-operation, but also brought up some of the big issues that divide America, like immigration and abortion.

The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at the station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

What do we do about the enormous commercial power and influence wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google? It's one of the great questions of our time. Today Labour has been talking about what it would like to do. Its deputy leader Tom Watson accused social media companies of choosing \"to profit from children, rather than protect them\". He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here to look at how this might work.

But there's also the? wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is, we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point; but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution.?Today, Labour's Deputy leader Tom Watson identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing, or new, competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil. But it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policymakers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online - and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long. Any new regulation will be need to be international, and armies of lobbyists are being paid to resist it. But the world has changed. Today's public square is digital, and it is now a question of when, not if, new rules are created to govern it. Thank you, Amol.

President Trump was finally able to deliver his annual State of the Union address last night after it was delayed because of the US government shutdown. The president spoke of unity and co-operation, but also brought up some of the big issues that divide America, like immigration and abortion. Our correspondent Nick Bryant watched the speech and joins us now. George, this was the State of the Union address that almost didn't happen, and Donald Trump made news by announcing he will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam for their second summit later in the month, but there's still no sign of political peace raking out at home. -- breaking out.
