Gov. Gavin Newsom addressed the question preoccupying students, teachers and parents on Friday by ordering schools closed to students in coronavirus-stricken counties, at least until those counties can stay off the state watchlist for two straight weeks or unless public health officials seek waivers with the blessing of superintendents. And when kids do return, prepare for changes: masks will be mandatory for most. POLITICO\u2019s Mackenzie Mays has the story.   Major districts around the state had already taken the plunge before Newsom acted, with hubs like San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento already moving to keep kids out of classrooms when the 2020-21 school year commences, and the county watch list already encompasses most of California\u2019s population. Teachers and their unions were sounding the alarm, warning that many schools lacked the equipment and physical capacity to keep people safe as hospitalizations and cases soar around the state.   But that reluctance to resume in-person schooling has collided with President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence that schools welcome back students in the fall. Trump has suggested federal funding could be tied to school openings, and last week he lambasted Los Angeles\u2019 decision to delay a return as a \u201cmistake\u201d and a \u201cterrible decision.\u201d The feds have already dogged California over restrictions, warning of legal repercussions and asking to join oral arguments over limits on gatherings, and Newsom\u2019s order could intensify the pressure from the White House.   Diplomat-in-chief Newsom again downplayed federal pushback when asked, saying he had no interest in trying to \u201cscore cheap political points\u201d by clashing with Trump and acknowledging the economic imperatives Trump has raised: \u201cI recognize the president's insistence from an economic paradigm,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI get that,\u201d also conceding that indefinite time out of classrooms is a less-than-ideal situation: \u201cNone of us want to see education virtualized. At least I don\u2019t.\u201d   Yet Trump and Newsom continue to differ on an indispensable virus-fighting tool: masks. Newsom already ordered face coverings statewide, and his schools directive ensures young Californians will be donning protection when they do get back to classes. The governor regularly implores Californians to mask up, saying on Friday that while they may be uncomfortable and unattractive, \u201cif every American wore masks, in just a number of weeks we\u2019ll have dramatically bent the curve.\u201d But Trump has continued to contradict health officials who call mask-wearing critical, as POLITICO\u2019s Nolan McCaskill reports , \u2014 although California has rarely enforced the mandate, per the LA Times .   BUENOS D\u00cdAS, good Monday morning. The Legislature is slated to return one week from today \u2014 so enjoy your final bit of respite before what promises to be a more frenetic than usual end of session, given the condensed schedule.   QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t understand, mayors often have no control what opens up and doesn\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s either at a state or county level. And I do agree that those things happened too quickly.\u201d LA Mayor Eric Garcetti deflects some blame while conceding to CNN his city reopened too swiftly.   TWEET OF THE DAY: Rep. Adam Schiff @RepAdamSchiff on fellow Californian Rep. Kevin McCarthy backing the president\u2019s pardon of Roger Stone: \u201cThis is how democracies die. When party leaders tolerate lies and deceit to cover up for a president of their party. When they refuse to defend their own institution. When they care about nothing but the perpetuation of their power and office. When they become Kevin McCarthy.\u201d     A message from Facebook:     Facebook launches Global State of Small Business Report. At Facebook, we are committed to helping small businesses succeed.

It's Friday, June 26. Hospitalizations rise in southern, central CAHealth care workers at a Kaiser hospital in San Francisco on April 9. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters Amid a continued surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday made public the coronavirus models[1] California is using to inform its public health orders, calling on 'citizen scientists,' 'experts in artificial intelligence,' 'Nobel laureates' and everyday people to help improve the models. The request followed a 32% increase in hospitalizations and 19% increase in ICU admissions over the past two weeks. </p><p>It also came a week after Newsom issued a statewide order requiring Californians to wear masks in most public places[2], which numerous county sheriffs refuse to enforce[3]. Newsom on Thursday suggested that sharing the models and open-source data[4] would help convince more Californians that wearing masks is necessary.  Newsom: 'Dare I say this, we want to back up the health professionals because this is the data they use to guide their decision-making. And often that decision-making is questioned by pundits We want to put all of this out there, and we want it tested, and we want it challenged.' The uptick in coronavirus-related hospitalizations largely derives from several southern and central California counties, including Imperial, Kings, Los Angeles, Stanislaus, San Bernardino, Orange and Kern counties, CalMatters' tracker shows[5]. Imperial has by far the highest concentration, with about 45 people hospitalized per 100,000. The state is currently monitoring 15 counties[6] experiencing hospitalization upticks, increased virus transmission or limited hospital capacity.  Newsom: 'Imperial County simply cannot absorb the total number of new positive cases, hospitalizations. When our system cannot absorb, when there's a capacity consideration or limitation, that's when we obviously have alarm bells that are raised.'  ______________The coronavirus bottom line:As of 9 p.m. Thursday night, California had195,571 confirmed coronavirus casesand5,733 deathsfrom the virus, according toaCalMatters tracker[7].Also:CalMatters regularly updates this pandemic timeline tracking thestate's daily actions[8]. And we'retracking the state's coronavirus hospitalizations by county[9].Advertisement <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/patricio-portillo/ca-takes-step-forward-new-clean-truck-proposalOther\">https://www.nrdc.org/experts/patricio-portillo/ca-takes-step-forward-new-clean-truck-proposalOther</url> stories you should know 1. Stricter consumer privacy measure qualifies for November ballot Image via iStock A measure that would add teeth to California's landmark 2018 online consumer privacy law qualified Wednesday[10] for the November ballot \u2014 another indication that Big Tech has a lot at stake[11] in the upcoming election. The initiative would prevent businesses from sharing consumers' personal information and limit their access to sensitive data, including location, race, religion, sexual orientation, union membership and private communications. It would also create a state agency to enforce the law and triple penalties for companies that sell data from children under 16 without their consent.Opponents argue[12] the measure could cost small businesses jobs and that Californians haven't had enough time to gauge the effectiveness of the 2018 law, which the state will start enforcing next month.2. In historic move, CA mandates zero-emission big rigs, trucks, buses Electric trucks are mandated in California under a new rule adopted today. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters California on Thursday adopted the world's first regulation to force manufacturers to ramp up sales of zero-emission trucks and buses over the next 15 years, CalMatters' Rachel Becker reports[13]. Under the rule passed unanimously by the state's air board, 55% of delivery vans and large pickups, 75% of larger vehicles like school buses and 40% of big rigs sold in California must be zero-emissions by 2035. Though manufacturing costs will shoot up, the air board estimates the new rule will result in billions of dollars of savings in the long run and reduce smog and pollution disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities and those of color. 3. Lawmakers want answers from CA's unemployment agency Can California's outdated tech system keep up with unemployment claims? Image via iStock Lawmakers are fed up with the state department that handles unemployment claims. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Fresno Republican, requested Thursday a state audit of the Employment Development Department[14], pointing to data showing 75% of Californians who called the department one week in May couldn't reach a live representative[15]. The move came the same week Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat, posted several Twitter[16] threads[17] excoriating the department.  Chiu[18]: 'It's difficult to say this as someone who generally believes in govt's ability to help, but @CA_EDD is failing CA. I have done just about everything I know how to do as a public official to make things work, but my colleagues, my staff, my constituents &amp;#38; I are at our wits' end.' As of Thursday, 5.7 million Californians[19] had filed new unemployment applications. Over 287,000 filed first-time claims last week[20], around a 20% increase from the week before. 4. California's upcoming all-mail election, explained Image via iStock As California gears up for an all-mail November election, officials are scrambling to ensure that every registered active voter will receive a ballot in the mail \u2014 while also preparing in-person voting options that lend themselves to social distancing and frequent sanitizing. Can the state pull it off? And there are political challenges beyond the logistical ones, with President Donald Trump alleging that remote voting will give Democrats an unfair advantage and lead to mail fraud. How secure are mail-in ballots, and do they actually advantage one party over another?

It's Friday, June 26.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hospitalizations rise in southern, central CA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Amid a continued surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday made public the coronavirus models California is using to inform its public health orders, calling on \"citizen scientists,\" \"experts in artificial intelligence,\" \"Nobel laureates\" and everyday people to help improve the models.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The request followed a 32% increase in hospitalizations and 19% increase in ICU admissions over the past two weeks. It also came a week after Newsom issued a statewide order requiring Californians to wear masks in most public places, which numerous county sheriffs refuse to enforce.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Newsom on Thursday suggested that sharing the models and open-source data would help convince more Californians that wearing masks is necessary.</p><p> * Newsom: \"Dare I say this, we want to back up the health professionals because this is the data they use to guide their decision-making. And often that decision-making is questioned by pundits \u2026 We want to put all of this out there, and we want it tested, and we want it challenged.\"</p><p> The uptick in coronavirus-related hospitalizations largely derives from several southern and central California counties, including Imperial, Kings, Los Angeles, Stanislaus, San Bernardino, Orange and Kern counties, CalMatters' tracker shows. Imperial has by far the highest concentration, with about 45 people hospitalized per 100,000.</p><p> * Newsom: \"Imperial County \u2026 simply cannot absorb the total number of new positive cases, hospitalizations. \u2026 When our system cannot absorb, when there's a capacity consideration or limitation, that's when we obviously have alarm bells that are raised.\"</p><p> The state is currently monitoring 15 counties experiencing hospitalization upticks, increased virus transmission or limited hospital capacity.</p><p> ______________</p><p> The coronavirus bottom line: As of 9 p.m. Thursday night, California had 195,571 confirmed coronavirus cases and 5,733 deaths from the virus, according to a CalMatters tracker.</p><p> Also: CalMatters regularly updates this pandemic timeline tracking the state's daily actions. And we're tracking the state's coronavirus hospitalizations by county.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Advertisement</p><p> ------------</p><p> Other stories you should know</p><p> 1. Stricter consumer privacy measure qualifies for November ballot</p><p> A measure that would add teeth to California's landmark 2018 online consumer privacy law qualified Wednesday for the November ballot \u2014 another indication that Big Tech has a lot at stake in the upcoming election. The initiative would prevent businesses from sharing consumers' personal information and limit their access to sensitive data, including location, race, religion, sexual orientation, union membership and private communications. It would also create a state agency to enforce the law and triple penalties for companies that sell data from children under 16 without their consent.</p><p> * Alastair Mactaggart, the San Francisco real estate developer behind the initiative: \"During these times of unprecedented uncertainty, we need to ensure that the laws keep pace with the ever-changing ways corporations and other entities are using our data.\"</p><p> Opponents argue the measure could cost small businesses jobs and that Californians haven't had enough time to gauge the effectiveness of the 2018 law, which the state will start enforcing next month.</p><p> 2. In historic move, CA mandates zero-emission big rigs, trucks, buses</p><p>California on Thursday adopted the world's first regulation to force manufacturers to ramp up sales of zero-emission trucks and buses over the next 15 years, CalMatters' Rachel Becker reports. Under the rule passed unanimously by the state's air board, 55% of delivery vans and large pickups, 75% of larger vehicles like school buses and 40% of big rigs sold in California must be zero-emissions by 2035. Though manufacturing costs will shoot up, the air board estimates the new rule will result in billions of dollars of savings in the long run and reduce smog and pollution disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities and those of color.</p><p> 3. Lawmakers want answers from CA's unemployment department</p><p> Lawmakers are fed up with the state department that handles unemployment claims. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Fresno Republican, requested Thursday a state audit of the Employment Development Department, pointing to data showing 75% of Californians who called the department one week in May couldn't reach a live representative. The move came the same week Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat, posted several Twitter threads excoriating the department.</p><p> * Chiu: \"It's difficult to say this as someone who generally believes in govt's ability to help, but @CA_EDD is failing CA. I have done just about everything I know how to do as a public official to make things work, but my colleagues, my staff, my constituents &amp; I are at our wits' end.\"</p><p> As of Thursday, 5.7 million Californians had filed new unemployment applications. Over 287,000 filed first-time claims last week, around a 20% increase from the week before.</p><p> 4. California's upcoming all-mail election, explained</p><p> As California gears up for an all-mail November election, officials are scrambling to ensure that every registered active voter will receive a ballot in the mail  \u2014 while also preparing in-person voting options that lend themselves to social distancing and frequent sanitizing. Can the state pull it off? And there are political challenges beyond the logistical ones, with President Donald Trump alleging that remote voting will give Democrats an unfair advantage and lead to mail fraud. How secure are mail-in ballots, and do they actually advantage one party over another?

Singapore Press Holdings[1]\u2014 publisher of its flagship Straits Times \u2014 is confronting the worldwide downturn in newspaper business fortunes. The large daily (383,000 daily circulation[2], print and digital) and its well-regarded parent SPH saw some tough numbers last year:down[3]16.9 percent in ad revenue, 13 percent in overall revenue and five percent in circulation revenue for the fiscal year ending September 2017. Profits suffered as well, down 33 percent. And SPH, which still employs 1,200 journalists across its array of11 newspapers[4]in four languages, magazines, and radio stations, announced significant job cuts in October, with230 positions cut[5]. The globally oriented company now plans to fund an overseas correspondent staff of 40. None of those results is news to North American or European publishers, who have suffered similarly. </p><p>Print business woes are universal across the developed world. What's intriguing about SPH is its evolving set of strategies to forge a more robust future. How far will it extend itself in its new nursing home business? Can luxe retail malls continue to fund journalism? Might a plan for a state-of-the-global art city delivery service help revive readership?  First published at Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab on Jan. 9, 2018 Follow Newsonomics on Twitter @kdoctor  Everyone who's learned about the more than half-century-old Singapore experiment knows the city-state is a special case. It's essentially a one-party state run by highly competent central planners. For a place that wasn't much more than a fishing backwater at the dawn of the 20th century, English-speaking Singapore now ranks as the fourth wealthiest country on the planet. Its 1.6 million expats drive much of the regional economy, enjoying a relatively un-congested, well-working cosmopolitan center, even if they'll tell you the state's closed-circuit-TV-everywhere approach to security and societal control can be a bit unnerving. Meanwhile, Singapore's four million multi-lingual citizens and permanent residents enjoy a level of housing, health, and education security that's the envy of many around the world. All in a city-state that ranksthird[6]in population density (behind Macau and Monaco) globally. SPH may be that virtual monopoly, but it's a publicly listed company, and as such, it still has to make its numbers work. Part of its current challenge: the onrushing businesses of Google and Facebook. 'It's a rapid rise in the last 12, 18 months,' says deputy CEO Anthony Tan. AddsAlan Soon[7], a veteran digital executive in Asia for Yahoo and other companies: 'Singapore typically trails the U.S. by about two to three years when it comes to trends' Singapore-based Soon, who recently opened upSplice Newsroom[8]'to deliver business intelligence on the media industry in Asia,' confirms that the hot breath of Google and Facebook has been more greatly felt in Asia more widely and more recently, though he notes that each media market experiences it differently. 'In other parts, like Indonesia, that impact could take five years-plus to play out.' But the impact of the duopolistic ad dominance is truly becoming global. Soon assesses SPH, which has seen its share price drop by a quarter over the past year, candidly. 'SPH's revenue and monopoly are the envy of the region. You'd expect a company with an annual operating revenue of S$1 billion (FY 2017) to be more aggressive in building out digital products and serving a distinct audience. SPH is hemmed in on two sides. First, it has a credibility problem. The government's control of editorial policy and coverage means the organization will continue to be viewed as mouthpiece for propaganda. Second, the company faces the same disruption to its business as other media companies with digital. Newspaper circulation is down as people spend more time on digital platforms.' I talked with Anthony Tan at his SPH office just after Christmas and got a wide view of the company's thinking, plans, and bets big and small. Among them, a newbusiness news radio station[9](Money FM 89.3, launching Jan. 29), participation in a project to assess newspaper delivery in the age of Amazon (which offers two-hour delivery in Singapore) logistics, and major investment in nursing homes and malls. The key word here: cross-subsidy. That's the building of ancillary businesses to support the basic craft of news. That's a theme familiar to two European media contrarians, Schibsted and Axel Springer, both of which have built large non-news publishing businesses to help their news businesses in the long arc of business transformation. Forty-four-year-oldTan[10], a savvy watcher of global news industry trends, moved into the company's deputy CEO position 18 months ago, after joining the company as executive vice-president in 2015. Like many SPH executives, his experience included high-level governmental positions (deputy secretary in the health ministry, director in the manpower ministry) as well as ones in the private businesses of retail malls and the health industry \u2014 both of which have proved handy in his new role. His role has continued to grow and in 2017, he was given responsibility for all of the company's publishing businesses, separated by language into the English/Malay/Tamil Media Group and the Chinese Media Group. Tan has a big turnaround job in front of him. While 'media' drives three-quarters of the company's revenues, it now contributes only 35 percent of the company's profits. Though it is making significant cross-subsidy moves, the company is playing catchup. That's where the new businesses \u2014 headed by the acquisition of higher-end nursing home supplier Orange Valley Healthcare last April \u2014 will play a big role. Here's my interview with Tan on SPH's road ahead, edited for length and clarity. KEN DOCTOR: 2017 was the year of pushback for Google and Facebook. A lot of it around fake news, and the platforms' part in propagating it. But also fear of big tech. And the Europeans, in fining Google $5.3 billion last year, have pushed a lot more in terms of market domination. Has the question of market domination come up in Asia? Is there any kind of regulatory or judicial pushback on Google or Facebook? ANTHONY TAN: I think judicial, less so. There's no common consensus. In many Asian countries \u2014 I hate to use the word to describe it, but it's mainly protectionism. You would see countries of different persuasions, of different inclinations, some of which have become protectionist against the dominance of Google.DOCTOR: What kind of actions have they taken? TAN: One good example off the top of my head \u2014 South Korea. If you look at South Korea, many of the services that Google provides don't work very well in Korea. Maps, at least, doesn't work very well. I think maybe it's because it's a difficult language.DOCTOR: Are they not letting them do mapping? TAN: If you have been to Seoul, the interesting thing is that if you pick up Google Maps, the only way you can navigate is in straight lines, which doesn't work. They have a more sophisticated explanation, but this didn't come officially. I was a visitor, and I asked. They said that, well, this is highly confidential, and the North Koreans are going to use it. Some people explain it that way. It's not like in Vietnam, or in China, where they were barred from driving the vehicles around by the police.China, of course, is very extreme. China and Vietnam have gotten very extreme. They've just got firewalls, very sophisticated firewalls. That has allowed the growth of their own companies. As markets, they're big enough. I think that's an advantage in language you will see in Korea, you will see in Japan. Japan, I think, has been a bit more embracing, but they do have their own quirks. Then, the smaller countries, like us, many of us have grown up in a free-trade environment. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, to a certain extent \u2014many of the colonies, past colonies, whether British, French, or otherwise, have open economic policies.DOCTOR: What's the impact of Google and Facebook on your business? TAN: Google and Facebook find that it is obviously useful to be in Singapore, because it's a good place to be for the markets. Google has taken up huge premises in Alexandra [an affluent Singapore region]. Facebook has moved into new premises in a matter of years as well. It has now become fashionable to be in the digital marketing space. Agencies and advertisers want to be at least on Facebook.DOCTOR: How recently have you felt the pressure? Like, the last two, three years? TAN: It's a rapid rise in the last 12, 18 months. It used to be that there would be one person at, say, a retail chain in charge of all the advertising decisions. These days, over the past 18 months, you have seen more of them hiring someone totally new for digital. They always hire millennials. Not especially those who have been in advertising \u2014 they are just people who seem to be in touch. I think it has been a bit of that whole halo effect that Facebook and Google has.Rewriting strategy in the platform age DOCTOR: How has that changed your sales strategy? TAN: More relationship selling. You have to appeal to both the left and right brain, I think, in dealing with your customers. You have to give them the data and the stats to prove that the dollar is well spent, but also have that relationship building.When faced with a mammoth giant, we have to think of new ideas. One of the new ways is that we have decided to tie up with our TV national broadcaster. In January, we will have the private exchange setup, so we are actually selling premium programmatic in a joint venture.DOCTOR: How much extra do you think you will be able to yield from premium programmatic, compared to regular programmatic? 40 percent extra or less? TAN: 30.DOCTOR: Which would mean about what kind of rate in Singapore dollars [which trade at about 75 cents U.S.]? TAN: 20-ish. Yeah. The beauty of it is that, in Singapore, there are quite a lot of advertisers \u2014 whether it be the public sector, government agencies, public agencies, or some of the brands \u2014 who had a few scares over the last year and a half when some of their programmatic ads went onto pornographic sites, which we are very touchy about, extremist sites, and stuff like that.DOCTOR: Direct sales are harder? TAN: Direct sales are harder, because of Google and Facebook.DOCTOR: You are investing in branded content? TAN: Webought[11]an outfit called Brand New Media. We bought the Singapore and Philippines operations from the Australian founder.DOCTOR: Part of that cross-selling is an effort to get more yield out of your sales forces, right? I know expense and headcount reduction is a key goal.You have a newspaper, magazines and radio, but TV is separate, right?TAN: TV is separate. We used to have two TV stations about a decade ago and we sold it to the national broadcaster, Mediacorp. We're also cross-selling with the cable TV operator StarHub. DOCTOR: Then you can sell across radio, magazines, and newspaper. TAN: That's right. And outdoor.Investing in malls and nursing homes: The cross-subsidy strategy DOCTOR: I've read that you are now you're in the nursing home business. And you're in real estate. It looked like about, what, 25 percent of the revenues are coming from other businesses? TAN: And more than 50 percent of the profit. A bit of perspective of our history. The company is 34 years old this year. We were exclusively a newspaper company; back then, we weren't even printing magazines. They had the foresight to see the advent of digital technology, that one day, somehow, the good days of print would come to an end. Back then, they had with cash and they began to make sensible acquisitions in a new business area, thinking that, at the core of that, we will always remain a newspaper media company. So they bought the first shopping mall on Orchard Road, if you've been to Orchard Road. [I have. Singapore is home to some of the more amazing shopping malls, with Gucci, Bulgari, Dolce ...bbana, Burberry, and Prada shops, amid the multi-gastronomy of its luxe food courts. Orchard Road itself touts itself to international shoppers as a '2.2 km shopping belt.']We bought one of the bigger shopping malls there. The chaps who bought it allegedly almost lost their jobs, because there was a school of thought on the board and in senior management that media will never die, print will always be king.Over the years, we developed some condominiums, which we sold on land that used to be our factory land before. Since then, we have built two more malls, bought into one more mall, and we are adding another mall next year. Property has become quite a good business.  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/05/newsonomics-in-norway-a-newspapers-digital-video-startup-is-now-generating-more-revenue-than-print/?relatedstory\">http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/05/newsonomics-in-norway-a-newspapers-digital-video-startup-is-now-generating-more-revenue-than-print/?relatedstory</url> RELATED ARTICLE[12] Newsonomics: In Norway, a newspaper's digital video startup is now generating more ad revenue than print[13] May 30, 2017[14];DOCTOR: It's a good investment. Igot a chance to visit the Schibsted[15]last year. Fascinating company, and Norway of course is a small country, about the size of Singapore. More and more of their profit is coming from the other businesses as they're trying to transition the news business. Is that a similar philosophy? Nobody likes to use the word subsidize, but are you able to take profits here and invest them? TAN: Precisely. We call it a cross-subsidy. It's a good, defensible argument because it was the original profits that allowed us to foray into these other businesses.DOCTOR: That's true. You can justify it that way. TAN: It's a matter of perspective. I think the important thing to tell our colleagues is that we have not lost the focus \u2014 and to tell the market [investors, who haveknocked 25 percent off[16]of SPH's market value over the last year]. The market doesn't always listen, but the market is irrational sometimes. I think it's important that colleagues in the newsrooms understand that we need the ability to continue making investments, even in bad times, and to keep a reasonable workforce for journalism really stems from the ability for us to have economic success that is more resilient.DOCTOR: That makes sense, and yet all businesses have their cycles. In the U.S.,malls are hollowing out[17]. TAN: In Singapore, we are a bit more fortunate. In Asia, I think we are a bit more fortunate, and maybe it's the profile of malls that we have. They are doing very well, and they have recurring characteristics to return money like a utility. Best of all, it's not regulated, and that allows us to take the profit that we make from those to come and cross-subsidize or prop up some of our stable of titles, which is growing. We serve every official language of Singapore, so even the Tamil paper, which serves the Indian population, has a very small print run. That costs money to operate.DOCTOR: That's why you also bought into nursing homes last year? TAN: Then you ask, why nursing homes, right? After a while we also realized, in looking at the U.S. and many of the developed countries and their malls, property is also now subject to fluctuations. So we really needed to think of analogy of a stool. A three-legged stool is inherently more stable than a two-legged stool.DOCTOR: And you have an aging population. TAN: We wanted to find another league of business that was also resilient to cycles. The best deal is a sunrise instead of a sunset industry. We wanted to go into health care. There were no big players, mainly mom-and-pop operators.DOCTOR: Is this at the high end? TAN: The latest center that we are opening, we also tried to aim for the more affluent, middle, middle-upper income people. We also take in today a mix of people who are subsidized by the government. We take in Medicare, Medicaid-type patients, but we also take in private patients.DOCTOR: Well, you have really good social welfare programs here. You accept a mix of private and government. TAN: The main differentiator is air conditioning, believe it or not. In health care in Singapore, the subsidized patients don't get air conditioning. It's a differentiator.DOCTOR: People would wonder, given the nature of how the government works, and the relationship of government and press \u2014 if SPH is getting into the nursing home business, is that a decision that's an SPH board decision, and then you basically say, 'We have this capital, we're investing it?' TAN: Yeah.DOCTOR: At the top you said, 'We don't believe in protectionism.' You're talking about outside, but also in terms of competition. If you're going to be in the nursing home business, do you have any specific advantage? TAN: No. I just have to compete.The only regulated business that we are in is the newspaper business, because there's a newspaper and printing act that regulate that business. It's a purely commercial decision, no protectionism. I face competition every day from many other upstart, including foreigners who may want to come in. If they're given a license by the health authority to run a nursing facility, then I will have to compete.DOCTOR: Yeah. Do you deal with all those businesses? Your title is deputy CEO? TAN: Yeah. I deal with the media business; that's my bread and butter, including radio, and all the factors of production associated with it. Then I take care of the health care business, primarily. Of monopoly, culture, and boundaries DOCTOR: So if the government is not an investor in SPH, how do you describe your relationship in terms of what you decide to publish in terms of this? TAN: We get asked these questions either by the Americans or the Chinese \u2014 both different sides of the question.DOCTOR: The perception is you're free to publish, but you kind of know where the boundaries are. What do you think? Is that fair or not? TAN: I think 'culture' is an easy cop-out \u2014a simple explanation of what is essentially a complicated world. I would also say that if you look at \u2014 I hate to characterize it as Asian culture, but the other bit is really that every newspaper will always have a positioning.DOCTOR: Absolutely. TAN: In any society.DOCTOR: It needs to. If it doesn't have a position, it doesn't have a soul, right? TAN: It just happens that in the publications that we have, and of course the flagships, the positioning sits where people also extrapolate and say that, well, there might be boundaries. It's indeed true that there will be always be boundaries, but I don't think it inhibits us on a day-to-day basis. I get asked very strange questions as well by countries of lesser democratic natures that come to me and says, 'What time do you send your articles for review by authorities?' I say never, and they don't believe me. I don't get calls, I don't do anything. I may get shot \u2014 not by the authorities, but by other people who are criticizing articles. Every newspaper has to have a stand. That's the editor's relationship with me; I have to also respect it.DOCTOR: Who do the editor reports to? TAN: Administratively, they report to me. I own the licenses; I apply for all of the licenses.DOCTOR: If a Singaporean wanted to start another print newspaper, they apply for a license? TAN: Yes.DOCTOR: Is that hard to get? TAN: Well, I meanDOCTOR: Has anybody done it? TAN: Yeah. The national broadcaster used to publish a newspaper called Today. Now it's only online-only.DOCTOR: But nobody's done it? TAN: No, nobody's done it. A lot of people recently have gone online. Some have succeeded, some have failed. Then, one of our ex-colleagues did the middle ground, which was exclusively digital, online. Had a fledgling operation; well, maybe a dozen or so. But that wrapped up late last year. She couldn't make the economics work.DOCTOR: Well, the economics would be even harder. TAN: Right. There's one that has survived these few years,Mothership[18]. Mothership was some investors, well-intentioned Singaporeans of different persuasions in the arts business space, who put together this group. They are doing, I think, reasonably well. Some of the colleagues from our newsrooms have joined them, and it looks like they are doing okay.Investing in AI, apps, and maybe a revolutionary city delivery logistics system DOCTOR: Where else are you investing? What kinds of things are you investing in directly? TAN: Artificial intelligence. The traditional areas \u2014 say, for example, data analytics, artificial intelligence, better app technology to serve apps better. Web technology. I mean, I got a lot of grief after coming into the job: 'Your app doesn't work very well. Your app is not fast enough.' App versus web, mobile web. We have to keep up with the technology.DOCTOR: It takes a lot of investment, yeah. TAN: Right. Every time Google decides on something new or Facebook deprioritizes you in the News Feed, what it deems news, then you have a challenge. So keeping a good relationship even with what you think is an enemy. Being a frenemy, I think, is better than being an enemy.Beyond digital \u2014 maybe it's this economy and the demographics of the country \u2014 I still have a very loyal print readership. It will go on for a while, because we have one of the world's longest life expectancies. [Singapore residentslive[19], on average 85 years, right behind Monaco and Japan.]My biggest challenge is that I need the paperboy for the future. I'm running out of paperboys in Singapore. People would rather be an Uber driver. Uber driver, Amazon parcel delivery guy, rather than a newspaper man. DOCTOR: So you have to pay more. TAN: I have to pay more. The converse side of looking at it as an opportunity is that, if I don't pay more, can I make it a full-time job? I'm quite happy to accept jobs from Amazon.DOCTOR: It's really becoming part of the modern logistics economy. Are you doing that? TAN: We had started doing some experiments. First with some retailers that are outsourced a small bit, just for us to try our logistics business. The other thing that we have tried also recently is to try to bundle it. We also have a little convenience store business that I don't know whether you know of. We have about 70 outlets in Singapore. Why? Newsstands.The traditional newsstands where going the way of the dodo \u2014 the individual mom-and-pop operated ones. So we needed something. The individual 7-Elevens were charging a hell of a lot for us to shop newspapers there. They wouldn't keep selling those papers. So we've also we started bundling and said: Can I deliver a loaf of bread or some eggs with your newspaper? We don't have to do it every day, but if you subscribe to our newspapers in certain delivery zones, we can do it maybe two times a week, three times a week, depending on your preference.DOCTOR: You're delivering convenience items? TAN: Yeah, eggs.DOCTOR: So if I'm at my condo, SPH delivers to me? TAN: We actually don't have a delivery company. We work with what we call a freelance agency. We have the app, and we are beta testing that app. We even started selling newspapers.DOCTOR: The idea there is to offset the cost of newspaper delivery by delivering other stuff. Do you think you could grow a lot, or do you know yet? TAN: I don't think that it will grow a lot, but it will help complement the business. We are a high-rise city, and many people are going to be over 65. They're going to have bad knees, even though they'll have lift stops on every floor. Every morning they would need someone to deliver a newspaper to them, and in addition to that, maybe a loaf of bread every other two days. A dozen eggs.DOCTOR: Have you talked to Amazon about any kind of partnership? TAN: Amazon is quite interesting in Singapore, because as far as I understand their model, they outsource it to many of these logistics providers. We are thinking about whether or not that's something that we should go into a bit more seriously. We've got a network, we've got people.We've made a small investment in an e-commerce site in Singapore called Q10, which is Korean in origin. They're the No. 1 site on merchandising value. They are a bit like Amazon, but they don't hold their own inventory \u2014 just like Amazon actually. They have their own logistics company, so whether we would make a further investment, whether we would work with them \u2014 it's early days.DOCTOR: You've got all the elements here. You have a high-rise city; you have, probably, the best central planning in the world that I've seen. From a planning point of view, it makes overall sense to make as efficient a system as you can, also to reduce pollution and congestion. I'm wondering if there is a model there of how you encourage companies that are in the delivery business, how you incentivize them to work together. Does that make sense? TAN: Yes. There is an ongoing effort. There might be a sort of network of federated lockers that are delivery-service agnostic.DOCTOR: In each neighborhood. Or in a building \u2014 it could be in a high rise. TAN: Anywhere. They are a bit like Amazon's lockers, but not exclusive to Amazon. Amazon can use it, UPS can use, or whoever.DOCTOR: Is that a live experiment? TAN: No. There is a plan to launch a tender and see whether or not there will be commercial interest to operate.DOCTOR: It would a for-profit system of federated lockers, and then they would negotiate with each of the delivery agencies? TAN: Then the delivery agencies are a question, because the point is how many last-mile logistic providers can Singapore support? The core business DOCTOR: How dependent are you still on advertising in your core business? TAN: About 70 percent. We've always been like that; it was a bit of an aberration. Plus our newspaper has always been very cheap \u2014our newspapers are dirt cheap, compared to anywhere else in the world.DOCTOR: Is it profitable every day? TAN: Yes, it is.DOCTOR: Even Monday, Tuesday? TAN: Yes. I will keep print going for as long as I can because it's still a profitable business.DOCTOR: How much are you charging now for a seven-day print subscription? TAN: Seven-day print? Depending. The face value price will be $24.90 plus a three-dollar delivery fee, generally. For four weeks.DOCTOR: You get digital access included? TAN: We used to have bundling. We first bundled in the early days of digital. Now you havedifferent packages[20], depending on what you want, digital PDF or digital access.DOCTOR: You do have a unique opportunity here. You have high rises, you have a long-lived population, and you've got nursing homes. That's a good strategy. TAN: The first thing I did when we bought the nursing home was to bring in the newspapers. I made sure that the newspapers were available to the elderly. The elderly have the most time to read newspapers.DOCTOR: Are you selling them, or are you giving them? TAN: No, no. Giving them.DOCTOR: Can you include it as part of the fee, and have the fee pay part of it? That wouldn't work? TAN: They would riot in Singapore. But it's okay. It's a bit of community service.DOCTOR: I see that you are offering a text-to-audio product. Is it much used? TAN: Yeah. Especially in the vernacular papers. In the Chinese newspapers, especially. From two sides. One is the illiterate elderly, who still want to read it. And the young, who are literate, but the parents force them, because they have to learn their mother tongue, Chinese, but it can be very difficult.DOCTOR: Is that your own technology, or is that partnered? TAN: No, we took the technology and formatted to our use. I don't think many people have used this technology, text-to-speech. I can't say that we are the first.My kid's latest craze is to play with the Google Assistant. We've been thinking about it, and working on how to deliver news in podcasts. The news will be read to me \u2014 that might be the future. I mean, just as the U.S. has got with Amazon with Echo and Google Assistant, China has also seen a rise in some of these.We are technology takers in some way, and I think we need to invest more in keeping a bit ahead of the curve where technology advances are. In the past one or two years, I've been reminding colleagues that we are not a newspaper company \u2014 we are a media company. The frame of change of mind is very important.

In Australia[14], in Canada[15] and in Europe[16], legislators and <xhtml:span class=\"hit\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">regulators</xhtml:span> have raised their voices and leveled new threats.

On its own, that may seem like just one more move in the chess game between major news companies and the platforms. But it could also be an indication of a more geologic movement. Will the rest of 2020 bring tectonic shifts in platforms' power over news \u2014 or just a few more small tremors?</p><p> The growing ad boycott of Facebook[1] by global marketers is another indication that the shaking may bring more of a jolt this time. So are[2] the state attorneys generals' actions[3] and the soon-to-come Department of Justice antitrust move[4]. 'It's time to re-examine all of our relationships with the big platforms,' New York Times COO Meredith Levien[5] told me. 'And we're reexamining them on three axes that are all interrelated, but different with each of the players.' Levien's three questions: 'What role does the company play in helping bring audiences to the Times? Or said more technically, what role do they play in that funnel?' 'What role does this company play in helping us do the main thing we're trying to do? Which is scale direct relationships with people and get them to form a habit and ultimately pay.' What's the value equation \u2014 'recognizing that these companies get substantial value from our investment in original journalism'? 'All three of those things really matter,' says Levien, who came to the Times in 2013 as head of advertising and moved into the COO job, Mark Thompson's second-in-command, three years ago. She's widely considered a prime contender for Thompson's job whenever the 62-year-old CEO exits. 'At this moment, it doesn't make sense for us to participate in Apple News anymore.' This likely won't be the only adjustment the Times makes in the coming months on its platform relationships. 'In the last year, 18 months, we're thinking really hard about all of our relationships in this context,' she said. 'We're really trying to deeply calibrate how do we cut our own top through that ecosystem in a way that accounts for its reality? That's really what I'm describing to you. We get a little better with every passing year at how we do that. So that's why you see us making a change like this.' In short, the Times audience machine is proving more able to move towards its goal \u2014 10 million subscribers in 2025 \u2014 on its own. 'This has been a moment where something like 250 million \u2014 somewhere between 250 and 300 million people \u2014 used The New York Times at the height of the COVID crisis,' Levien said. 'When something like 6 in 10 American adults used The New York Times in March. And that's a bigger opportunity than we've had before to drive relationships with people. 'Ultimately the thing we're trying to do is play a bigger role in many more people's lives. And I think with each passing year, we're getting better and better at doing that ourselves. That doesn't mean we don't need distribution partners \u2014 we certainly do. That doesn't mean we don't need to find the outlets for our content that help us build audience. But I think that the equation for how we evaluate them changes.' So this isn't The New York Times cutting off all its platform relationships. But it's not a minor tremor, either.The publisher/platform danceThink of this as the next starting point for negotiation \u2014 the sort of negotiation common when players are on a more even playing field, reassessing their mutual value. But of course this still isn't close to being an even playing field. The absolute dominance of the big platforms in business life is hard to overestimate. The Times, for instance, will still work closely with Apple on podcasts \u2014 considering the increasing value of its flagship franchist The Daily[6] \u2014 and via its App Store, where the Times mobile app has proved key to building its strong subscriber engagement times. Thompson hasn't been shy about talking about the dangerous dance publishers still feel compelled to do with the huge platforms. Just a year ago, he spoke about why the Times, like The Washington Post, didn't join in the launch of Apple News+, Apple's fledgling, magazine-heavy paid offering. He said then[7] that Apple News+ 'jumbled different news sources into these superficially attractive mixtures.' It can be tough to understand the questions in these complex news company/aggregator relationships. In many ways, it comes down to how consumers understand what they're getting from whom. Ask people and many will tell you they're getting news 'from their phones.' And they are. But The New York Times \u2014 like all other news publishers who see reader revenue as the only route forward \u2014 wants them to know they're getting that news from them. The Times want a direct reader relationship \u2014 one that can hopefully be converted to subscription. Of course, that publisher-aggregator push-pull conflict goes back to the early web. Yahoo News \u2014 and debates among publishers about whether and how they should participate in it \u2014 dates back more than two decades. (As an executive at Knight Ridder Digital, I recall negotiating a 1999-era aggregation deal with CNET's Snap news aggregation product[8] and debating the same questions: Who is getting what value here?) The Times has been holding back what it gives to Apple News for a long time. 'We've been doing a limited number of stories a day \u2014 it went from a lot of stories at the beginning, broadly, to a smaller number[9],' Levien said. In return, the Times gets to promote its newsletters, subscription offers, and other calls-to-action, and it gets Comscore credit for its audience reading there. Basically, it gets branding and reach \u2014 but no direct revenue stream. Even some of its users may be confused about what Apple News is, exactly. For many, it's just generic 'news on my phone,' a set of notifications or a curation that pops up if they purposely (or accidentally) swipe or touch something. But it reaches a big audience \u2014 125 million users a month[10] as of April, up from 100 million three months earlier. It's one of several platform news aggregation plays: Google and Facebook compete directly worldwide, and Axel Springer's Upday[11] competes in Europe. It's distinct from Apple News+, which is mainly a magazine product plus three strong news players, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, and The Toronto Star. Apple News says the Times is one of the few publishers to opt out of its baseline product. 'The New York Times has only offered Apple News a few stories per day,' Apple spokesperson Fay Sliger said in a statement. 'We are committed to providing the more than 125 million people who use Apple News with the most trusted information and will continue to do so through our collaboration with thousands of publishers, including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Houston Chronicle, the Miami Herald, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and we will continue to add great new outlets for readers. 'We are also committed to supporting quality journalism through the proven business models of advertising, subscriptions, and commerce.'How the Times did its calculationThe Times' decision is all about the power of the direct publisher-journalist-reader relationship \u2014 the core of the reader revenue proposition \u2014 and the only way forward for news companies these days. The Times' move could be highly specific to the Times and not a harbinger of shifts to come. After all, no one else has been able to accomplish what the Times has: 6 million total subscribers, more than triple the number it had at the height of print, and on pace to reach its goal of 10 million in 2025. The farther it finds itself along that road, the more confidence it has in its own capabilities. And the more readers and subscribers it has, the more data it can analyze to see what works with what sorts of readers. And that analysis proved this to the Times: Apple News was not a net plus. How did its analysis work? There are two calculations. First is the question of how the Times itself can convert its more of its current readers into subscribers. 'We're getting increasingly confident in our ability to build and scale direct relationships on our own platforms,' Levien said. 'Therefore, we're very focused on: What does the funnel look like? What does the distribution partner bring to us? We're just getting sort of clearer and sharper about it. And then as we think about any of these relationships, we're also asking ourselves: Is this a product that is mostly, or purely, about bringing audience to the Times?' Second, there's this intriguing calculation \u2014 partly quantitative and, I'd suspect, deeply intuitive as well: Is Apple News (or any platform that want the Times content) a substitute \u2014 the dreaded good-enough alternative for busy news readers? 'There are plenty of people in the world that say, 'I get my news from the internet.' Which is something that isn't a news destination,' she said. 'We think very hard about if something is likely to be, in whole or in part, a substitutional product. It makes us think hard about value exchange. Are we getting enough in terms of value exchange? And that might be economics, that might be audience sent our way. It might be something that makes it easier for us to drive a direct relationship. That's the calculator.'The shift?Is this indeed part of a wider shift in the relationship of major news providers and Google and Facebook? Consider the latest datapoint: Google announced Friday[12] a new program to 'license' news from publishers, put into perspective well[13] by the Lab's Joshua Benton. Google and Facebook have been ramping up programs to aid publishers. Some of these programs have real value, in training, in funding, or in a few cases \u2014 quite selectively \u2014 in actually paying for news articles. To date, regional publishers tell me they've heard little to nothing about direct payment for news content. That could change, or the Google program \u2014 which noted Germany's Der Spiegel, Australia's InQueensland and InDaily, and Brazil's Diarios Associados in its initial release \u2014 may well just focus very selectively in its choice of titles and geography. It's no coincidence that these pay programs are ramping up in lockstep with pressures on the platforms mounting across at least three continents. In Australia[14], in Canada[15] and in Europe[16], legislators and regulators have raised their voices and leveled new threats. The mantra around the news media world: Pay us. We could see this coming, even before the added COVID-driven pressures on publishers, as I pointed out[17] in January. And there's no doubt we'll see more of it. Given the state of generalized global angst, of populist reaction, and of tech backlash \u2014 not to mention the oh-so-convenient target Big Tech offers, Google and Facebook in particular, but also Apple, Amazon, and Twitter \u2014 these companies know they have to give in, at least a little. So they act as any intelligent profit-maximizing corporations would do: calculate how much they can 'voluntarily' give in order to stave off more draconian actions, whether regulatory, antitrust, or tax-based. I asked Levien if the Times' ability to step away from Apple News was unique, given its digital success and position in the news marketplace. Her answer was circumspect. 'I would say many publishers' businesses look different, from one another and from ours. So I'm not going to speak for other publishers,' she said. 'What I would say though, is I do think that the economics for any publisher should be such that they can support the work, the extensive work of all the original, independent journalists. 'Our investment in journalism is only going up. It will go up this year \u2014 even this year, it's only going up. We are still hiring engineers and data scientists and product managers and product designers, in relatively large number.' (Indeed, it currently lists 128 U.S.-based job openings[18], including for 20 editors, 17 in audio, 10 reporters, 7 data analysts, and more than a dozen developers.) 'Even in a year where our ad business is under as much pressure as it is. So, the thing that we are trying to do is going to require constant investment. And at The New York Times, in good times and in harder times, the first dollar goes to the journalism in the investment.' Many different metrics count in the digital news business \u2014 but all of them are built on the foundation of large volumes of high-quality original news reporting and analysis. That's the key metric: How many journalists and people with associated skill sets in product and audience can a news organization support? And how does each and every platform deal support that \u2014 or not?

On its own, that may seem like just one more move in the chess game between major news companies and the platforms. But it could also be an indication of a more geologic movement. Will the rest of 2020 bring tectonic shifts in platforms\u2019 power over news \u2014 or just a few more small tremors?    The growing ad boycott of Facebook by global marketers is another indication that the shaking may bring more of a jolt this time. So are the state attorneys generals\u2019 actions and the soon-to-come Department of Justice antitrust move .    \u201cIt\u2019s time to re-examine all of our relationships with the big platforms,\u201d New York Times COO Meredith Levien told me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re reexamining them on three axes that are all interrelated, but different with each of the players.\u201d    Levien\u2019s three questions:    \u201cWhat role does the company play in helping bring audiences to the Times? Or said more technically, what role do they play in that funnel?\u201d  \u201cWhat role does this company play in helping us do the main thing we\u2019re trying to do? Which is scale direct relationships with people and get them to form a habit and ultimately pay.\u201d  What\u2019s the value equation \u2014 \u201crecognizing that these companies get substantial value from our investment in original journalism\u201d?    \u201cAll three of those things really matter,\u201d says Levien, who came to the Times in 2013 as head of advertising and moved into the COO job, Mark Thompson\u2019s second-in-command, three years ago. She\u2019s widely considered a prime contender for Thompson\u2019s job whenever the 62-year-old CEO exits.    \u201cAt this moment, it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to participate in Apple News anymore.\u201d    This likely won\u2019t be the only adjustment the Times makes in the coming months on its platform relationships. \u201cIn the last year, 18 months, we\u2019re thinking really hard about all of our relationships in this context,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to deeply calibrate how do we cut our own top through that ecosystem in a way that accounts for its reality? That\u2019s really what I\u2019m describing to you. We get a little better with every passing year at how we do that. So that\u2019s why you see us making a change like this.\u201d    In short, the Times audience machine is proving more able to move towards its goal \u2014 10 million subscribers in 2025 \u2014 on its own .    \u201cThis has been a moment where something like 250 million \u2014 somewhere between 250 and 300 million people \u2014 used The New York Times at the height of the COVID crisis,\u201d Levien said. \u201cWhen something like 6 in 10 American adults used The New York Times in March. And that\u2019s a bigger opportunity than we\u2019ve had before to drive relationships with people.    \u201cUltimately the thing we\u2019re trying to do is play a bigger role in many more people\u2019s lives. And I think with each passing year, we\u2019re getting better and better at doing that ourselves. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need distribution partners \u2014 we certainly do. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need to find the outlets for our content that help us build audience. But I think that the equation for how we evaluate them changes.\u201d    So this isn\u2019t The New York Times cutting off all its platform relationships. But it\u2019s not a minor tremor, either.   The publisher/platform dance   Think of this as the next starting point for negotiation \u2014 the sort of negotiation common when players are on a more even playing field, reassessing their mutual value.    But of course this still isn\u2019t close to being an even playing field. The absolute dominance of the big platforms in business life is hard to overestimate. The Times, for instance, will still work closely with Apple on podcasts \u2014 considering the increasing value of its flagship franchist The Daily \u2014 and via its App Store, where the Times mobile app has proved key to building its strong subscriber engagement times.    Thompson hasn\u2019t been shy about talking about the dangerous dance publishers still feel compelled to do with the huge platforms. Just a year ago, he spoke about why the Times, like The Washington Post, didn\u2019t join in the launch of Apple News+, Apple\u2019s fledgling, magazine-heavy paid offering. He said then that Apple News+ \u201cjumbled different news sources into these superficially attractive mixtures.\u201d    It can be tough to understand the questions in these complex news company/aggregator relationships. In many ways, it comes down to how consumers understand what they\u2019re getting from whom.    Ask people and many will tell you they\u2019re getting news \u201cfrom their phones.\u201d And they are. But The New York Times \u2014 like all other news publishers who see reader revenue as the only route forward \u2014 wants them to know they\u2019re getting that news from them . The Times want a direct reader relationship \u2014 one that can hopefully be converted to subscription.    Of course, that publisher\u2013aggregator push\u2013pull conflict goes back to the early web. Yahoo News \u2014 and debates among publishers about whether and how they should participate in it \u2014 dates back more than two decades. (As an executive at Knight Ridder Digital, I recall negotiating a 1999-era aggregation deal with CNET\u2019s Snap news aggregation product and debating the same questions: Who is getting what value here?)    The Times has been holding back what it gives to Apple News for a long time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a limited number of stories a day \u2014 it went from a lot of stories at the beginning, broadly, to a smaller number ,\u201d Levien said. In return, the Times gets to promote its newsletters, subscription offers, and other calls-to-action, and it gets Comscore credit for its audience reading there. Basically, it gets branding and reach \u2014 but no direct revenue stream.    Even some of its users may be confused about what Apple News is , exactly. For many, it\u2019s just generic \u201cnews on my phone,\u201d a set of notifications or a curation that pops up if they purposely (or accidentally) swipe or touch something. But it reaches a big audience \u2014 125 million users a month as of April, up from 100 million three months earlier. It\u2019s one of several platform news aggregation plays: Google and Facebook compete directly worldwide, and Axel Springer\u2019s Upday competes in Europe. It\u2019s distinct from Apple News+, which is mainly a magazine product plus three strong news players, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, and The Toronto Star.    Apple News says the Times is one of the few publishers to opt out of its baseline product.    \u201cThe New York Times has only offered Apple News a few stories per day,\u201d Apple spokesperson Fay Sliger said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to providing the more than 125 million people who use Apple News with the most trusted information and will continue to do so through our collaboration with thousands of publishers, including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Houston Chronicle, the Miami Herald, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and we will continue to add great new outlets for readers.    \u201cWe are also committed to supporting quality journalism through the proven business models of advertising, subscriptions, and commerce.\u201d   How the Times did its calculation   The Times\u2019 decision is all about the power of the direct publisher\u2013journalist\u2013reader relationship \u2014 the core of the reader revenue proposition \u2014 and the only way forward for news companies these days.    The Times\u2019 move could be highly specific to the Times and not a harbinger of shifts to come. After all, no one else has been able to accomplish what the Times has: 6 million total subscribers, more than triple the number it had at the height of print, and on pace to reach its goal of 10 million in 2025.    The farther it finds itself along that road, the more confidence it has in its own capabilities. And the more readers and subscribers it has, the more data it can analyze to see what works with what sorts of readers. And that analysis proved this to the Times: Apple News was not a net plus.    How did its analysis work? There are two calculations. First is the question of how the Times itself can convert its more of its current readers into subscribers.    \u201cWe\u2019re getting increasingly confident in our ability to build and scale direct relationships on our own platforms,\u201d Levien said. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019re very focused on: What does the funnel look like? What does the distribution partner bring to us? We\u2019re just getting sort of clearer and sharper about it. And then as we think about any of these relationships, we\u2019re also asking ourselves: Is this a product that is mostly, or purely, about bringing audience to the Times?\u201d    Second, there\u2019s this intriguing calculation \u2014 partly quantitative and, I\u2019d suspect, deeply intuitive as well: Is Apple News (or any platform that want the Times content) a substitute \u2014 the dreaded good-enough alternative for busy news readers?    \u201cThere are plenty of people in the world that say, \u201cI get my news from the internet.\u201d Which is something that isn\u2019t a news destination,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think very hard about if something is likely to be, in whole or in part, a substitutional product. It makes us think hard about value exchange. Are we getting enough in terms of value exchange? And that might be economics, that might be audience sent our way. It might be something that makes it easier for us to drive a direct relationship. That\u2019s the calculator.\u201d   The shift?   Is this indeed part of a wider shift in the relationship of major news providers and Google and Facebook?    Consider the latest datapoint: Google announced Friday a new program to \u201clicense\u201d news from publishers, put into perspective well by the Lab\u2019s Joshua Benton. Google and Facebook have been ramping up programs to aid publishers. Some of these programs have real value, in training, in funding, or in a few cases \u2014 quite selectively \u2014 in actually paying for news articles. To date, regional publishers tell me they\u2019ve heard little to nothing about direct payment for news content. That could change, or the Google program \u2014 which noted Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel, Australia\u2019s InQueensland and InDaily, and Brazil\u2019s Diarios Associados in its initial release \u2014 may well just focus very selectively in its choice of titles and geography.    It\u2019s no coincidence that these pay programs are ramping up in lockstep with pressures on the platforms mounting across at least three continents. In Australia , in Canada and in Europe , legislators and regulators have raised their voices and leveled new threats. The mantra around the news media world: Pay us .    We could see this coming, even before the added COVID-driven pressures on publishers, as I pointed out in January. And there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll see more of it. Given the state of generalized global angst, of populist reaction, and of tech backlash \u2014 not to mention the oh-so-convenient target Big Tech offers, Google and Facebook in particular, but also Apple, Amazon, and Twitter \u2014 these companies know they have to give in, at least a little.    So they act as any intelligent profit-maximizing corporations would do: calculate how much they can \u201cvoluntarily\u201d give in order to stave off more draconian actions, whether regulatory, antitrust, or tax-based.    I asked Levien if the Times\u2019 ability to step away from Apple News was unique, given its digital success and position in the news marketplace. Her answer was circumspect.    \u201cI would say many publishers\u2019 businesses look different, from one another and from ours. So I\u2019m not going to speak for other publishers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I would say though, is I do think that the economics for any publisher should be such that they can support the work, the extensive work of all the original, independent journalists.    \u201cOur investment in journalism is only going up. It will go up this year \u2014 even this year, it\u2019s only going up. We are still hiring engineers and data scientists and product managers and product designers, in relatively large number.\u201d    (Indeed, it currently lists 128 U.S.-based job openings , including for 20 editors, 17 in audio, 10 reporters, 7 data analysts, and more than a dozen developers.)    \u201cEven in a year where our ad business is under as much pressure as it is. So, the thing that we are trying to do is going to require constant investment. And at The New York Times, in good times and in harder times, the first dollar goes to the journalism in the investment.\u201d    Many different metrics count in the digital news business \u2014 but all of them are built on the foundation of large volumes of high-quality original news reporting and analysis. That\u2019s the key metric: How many journalists and people with associated skill sets in product and audience can a news organization support? And how does each and every platform deal support that \u2014 or not?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42478574330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607T-W8G1-JCSC-J4C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Nieman Lab</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Under that arrangement, Apple offered Amazon a 15% fee on subscriptions for Amazon's Prime Video app via the App Store, lower than a customary 30% fee. A growing list of companies are railing against Apple for allegedly anti-competitive rules in its App Store, the most recent being Fortnite maker Epic Games.  Major news publishers have joined a growing number of companies criticizing Apple over its App Store policies, which they argue promote anti-competitive practices.   Digital Content Next (DCN), a trade body representing the likes of The New York Times , The Washington Post, News Corp and CNBC , wrote to the iPhone maker asking how its members could qualify for a special deal like one given to Amazon in 2017.   Under that arrangement, Apple offered Amazon a 15% fee on customer subscriptions for Amazon's Prime Video app via the App Store, lower than Apple's customary 30% fee for most in-app purchases.   \"We would like to know what conditions our members \u2014 high quality digital content companies \u2014 would need to meet in order to qualify for the arrangement Amazon is receiving for its Amazon Prime Video app in the Apple App Store,\" DCN CEO Jason Kint said in a letter addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook.   Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.   Kint referred to a line of questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. at last month's congressional grilling of four top tech CEOs. At the House Antitrust Subcommittee, Johnson asked Cook if the agreement with Amazon was available to other app developers, to which Cook said: \"It's available to anyone meeting the conditions.\"   \"Nearly all of DCN's members offer apps in the Apple App Store and, as noted above, many offer subscription-based access to a wide variety of content,\" Kint said. \"The terms of Apple's unique marketplace greatly impact the ability to continue to invest in high-quality, trusted news and entertainment particularly in competition with other larger firms.\"   In a separate blog post , DCN Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Chris Pedigo said that news organizations have increasingly turned to subscriptions as a source of revenue as advertising incomes have \"cratered over the last decade.\" News publishers have also been heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic due to a steep decline in ad spending.   \"The monopolistic behavior of big tech puts a wide range of industries \u2014 not the least of which is the news industry \u2014 at a distinct disadvantage,\" Pedigo said. \"It is laudable that EU and American regulatory bodies are digging in and uncovering these anti-competitive behaviors. Talking trust is not enough. We need to level the playing field and transparency is a critical first step.\"   The EU recently opened two antitrust investigations into Apple, one of which focuses on the App Store. Brussels has said it will assess whether Apple's rules for app developers breach EU competition rules.   News organizations join an increasing list of companies railing against Apple for allegedly anti-competitive rules in its App Store. Last week, Epic Games brought a lawsuit against Apple and Google for booting its popular Fortnite game out of their respective software distribution platforms.   Fortnite was removed from the App Store and Android after it introduced a new way to buy in-game credits directly from Epic Games, effectively skirting Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store rules. Epic Games was particularly aggressive with its campaign against Apple, launching an ad that mocked Apple's famous \"1984\" ad for its Macintosh computer.   App makers such as Epic Games have criticized Apple's 30% cut of digital sales and approval process for apps. The App Store is the only means by which iPhone users can download their apps, unlike Google's Android mobile operating system which allows the installation of alternative app stores.   Earlier this week, Apple became the first publicly-listed company in the U.S. to reach a $2 trillion market cap .   \"Apple has put itself in a situation of trying to apply fair policy to an admittedly arbitrary set of rules,\" Jacob Eiting, the CEO of in-app subscription platform RevenueCat, told CNBC last week. He added that every interaction with an iPhone \"is an experience owned by Apple.\"   Meanwhile, regulators are also piling pressure on online platforms to pay news outlets for the distribution of their content. Last month, Australia's competition watchdog set out new rules that would require Google and Facebook to pay for news content in a world first. France's competition regulator ruled that Google must pay publishers for reusing their content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42890100535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N0-TR31-JCSC-J1CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp; COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT &amp; SOFTWARE MERCHANT WHOLESALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp; RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp; COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT &amp; SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>SIC3674 SEMICONDUCTORS &amp; RELATED DEVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>SIC3577 COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>SIC3572 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>SIC3571 ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Yet this massive private surveillance dragnet is largely beyond Americans' control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until now. On Jan.1, a landmark law in California will grant consumers the right to see the personal information that companies collect about them and stop them from selling it. The law is the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If companies extend these new rights to consumers outside the state, or if other states follow California's lead, the CCPA could effectively become a national law, privacy advocates say.</p><p>But the law, which takes effect next week, faces challenges. Business trade groups and lobbyists are seeking to revise it with amendments or preempt it with watered-down federal legislation, claiming the regulations are overly broad and could have unintended consequences that harm consumers and small businesses.</p><p>Bay Area real estate developer turned privacy activist Alastair Mactaggart, who put up more than $3million to place privacy protections before California voters in 2018, says he isn't backing down from his fight to give consumers more control over how Silicon Valley tracks them to target advertising. The statewide ballot initiative he funded drew more than 600,000 signatures, leading California lawmakers, tech companies and privacy advocates to hammer out a legislative compromise: the CCPA.</p><p>\"Whether or not we have everything in this particular law or the next one, it's a massive beachhead,\" Mactaggart says. \"Being California, we just have a unique opportunity. As we go, so goes the nation.\"</p><p>With calls for privacy regulation from Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail intensifying, Mactaggart is capitalizing on a growing unease with the tech industry's business tactics post-Cambridge Analytica. He says he's prepared to spend millions more on a new initiative for the 2020 ballot in California to keep business interests from chipping away at the CCPA. The ballot initiative would also protect sensitive information, like your health and financial records, and your precise location. And it would create a California agency to enforce the regulations.</p><p>But Jennifer King, director of consumer privacy at the Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, says the law may not help as many people as supporters hope.</p><p>\"I'm skeptical that the average person will even know this law exists, let alone know how to take advantage of it. Mostly I imagine that privacy advocates will put it to the test and publicize the results,\" she says. \"One of my concerns is that there is no budget allocated to public education on the issue, so most people are going to learn about it via word of mouth from advocates or friends. And, depending on how hard it is to exercise one's rights from company to company, and what results you receive in turn, individual experiences may vary a lot.\"</p><p>Want to take more control over your online data? Here's what you need to know.</p><p>What is the California Consumer Privacy Act?</p><p>California consumers have already begun to receive email notifications alerting them to changes under CCPA. The law, which takes effect Jan.1, gives California residents the right to know what data companies collect about them and to opt out of having their data sold. Businesses are also restricted in selling the personal information of children under 16.</p><p>Under the law, Californians can sue businesses for certain types of data breaches. For other violations, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will be able to bring enforcement actions starting in July. The regulations used to enforce the law are still being finalized.</p><p>What's the catch?</p><p>CCPA may be the nation's strongest privacy law, but privacy advocates warn it has limitations and the business community says it has drawbacks.</p><p>The law still puts the onus on consumers to take steps to protect their data. The problem: Americans trade away their privacy all the time. We click through privacy policies and terms of service without reading them. We buy phones that track us everywhere we go. We use smart speakers that record us in our homes. We take quizzes that give up intimate details about our lives.</p><p>Even if people want to assert their privacy rights, many don't know what those are, and the law will have little impact unless people use it, advocates say. Some 63% of Americans say they understand very little or nothing at all about the laws and regulations that protect the privacy of their data, Pew Research found.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly how the law will apply to major tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue they do not sell the information of consumers they track on the internet. \"In our case there's nothing to opt out from,\" Facebook said in a statement. Becerra is expected to offer more guidance on this issue in 2020.</p><p>If a business violates the law, it can be fined $2,500 per violation or $7,500 if the violation is determined to be intentional. But consumers have little recourse on their own except for data breaches. For the most part, they cannot sue companies that violate the law. Only Becerra can enforce the rules when companies don't respond to consumers' requests or delete their data.</p><p>\"We have a law that effectively makes the California Attorney General the chief privacy officer without the budget to do that,\" says Electronic Privacy Information Center associate director Mary Stone Ross, who helped draft the ballot initiative that led to the California law. \"It makes me nervous that some businesses are just going to take their chances.\"</p><p>What if I don't live in California?</p><p>In response to the upcoming law, some corporations like Microsoft are extending California's consumer protections to all Americans. Privacy advocates are betting other companies will follow suit. So they are urging consumers across the country to demand that companies delete their data and stop stockpiling it. Many companies are expected to comply with these requests.</p><p>\"Whether you are in California or not, you should take advantage of this great law,\" says Girard Kelly, counsel and director of the privacy program at Common Sense Media, the nonprofit advocacy group that helped draft the legislation. \"Know what companies are collecting about you. Know how it's being used, whether they are selling it, and, if they are selling it, know that you can opt out and say 'No, I don't want you to try to make money from my data.'\"</p><p>How do I exercise my privacy rights?</p><p>So, if you stream a lot of music on Spotify, you can send a form to the company directing the company not to sell your data. If your teen uses TikTok, you can send a form on your teen's behalf. A business must comply unless the information is necessary to complete a transaction or protect against fraud.</p><p>For instance, Hulu informs Californians that it collects all sorts of information, such as age, gender, IP address and viewing habits and makes inferences about you to recommend more programming.</p><p>You can opt out of having your information shared with advertisers including geolocation data and the insights Hulu gleans. But if you ask Hulu to delete all the information it collects about you, the streaming company warns it will have to cancel and delete your account.</p><p>In general there are two steps:</p><p>Fill out forms - one form per person, per company - to request your information, to have your information deleted or to instruct a company not to sell your information. Each form should take five to 10 minutes to complete.</p><p>Then file your forms electronically or by mail.</p><p>Common Sense Media has free resources for consumers including instructions on how to exercise your rights and the forms you need to request a company delete your personal information.</p><p>You can expect to get confirmation of your request to see your information and have your information deleted within 10 days. Businesses are supposed to send a response to that request within 45 days. You can request your personal information from businesses twice a year for free. The information they provide will go back 12 months.</p><p>Which businesses have to comply with the law?</p><p>It's not just big tech. Broadly speaking, most companies, no matter where they are based, must comply with the CCPA when serving California customers.</p><p>The law exempts some small businesses. It applies only to companies with at least $25million in revenue, personal information on at least 50,000 people or which generate at least half their money from selling consumers' personal information.</p><p>Why do businesses oppose the law?</p><p>Business interests complain the regulations are an overreaction to troubling revelations from the tech industry, such as Facebook's handling of user data, and place unfair burdens on small businesses that are not exempt and could deprive consumers of loyalty and rewards programs.</p><p>For example, businesses complain that the new California law broadens the definition of personal information to any information, including a specific device or browser that could be linked directly or indirectly to a consumer or household.</p><p>These interests are pushing California lawmakers to water down the law and Congress to pass federal legislation that would preempt it.</p><p>\"There may yet be unintended consequences to small businesses and consumers that can affect access to data, apps, advertising, and software tools,\" says Shoeb Mohammed, policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>How did California get a privacy law?</p><p>Mactaggart was chatting at a party with a Google engineer who confided that Americans would be horrified by how much Google knew about them.</p><p>In 2018, the real estate developer gathered signatures to put a privacy initiative on the California ballot. Tech companies put up $1million to fight the measure before backing off. Mactaggart agreed to take the measure off the ballot if the California legislature passed a data privacy law, which it did. That is the law that takes effect Wednesday.</p><p>Throughout 2019, tech companies worked to weaken the law before it takes effect and privacy advocates worked to strengthen it. So far, there have not been any significant changes.</p><p>What's next for privacy in California?</p><p>Mactaggart is working on the new ballot initiative. In California, these initiatives bypass the state legislature and the governor to create new laws.</p><p>If approved by voters, Mactaggart's measure would limit the sale of sensitive information such as sexual orientation and race; require that companies only collect as much information as is necessary for business purposes and inform consumers how long they intend to hold onto it; and would impose tougher penalties for violations involving children under age 16.</p><p>What are the privacy laws where I live?</p><p>Federal privacy legislation is stuck in Congress. No other states have adopted California's privacy regulations, though some states are exploring similar laws. Privacy advocates say if you want these protections in your state, call your representatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will enforce the state's new privacy law.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Rich Pedroncelli, AP Rich Pedroncelli, AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALIFN-sns-2087650550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALIFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVF-FWG1-DYJJ-P062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257787</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1862\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Californian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Californian (Salinas, California)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 28, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>State &amp;

On January 30, 2020, a group of nearly 30 industry groups and companies sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought advocating support for ONC and CMS\u2019 regulations.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Potential for Patients</emphasis><br/>Changes in policy could bring more functional accessibility for patients, say Sunny C. Lin, assistant professor of health systems management and policy at Oregon Health and Science University. \u00a0<br/>\u201cHHS has a vision of creating an interoperable health information infrastructure, where information can follow a patient freely as they see providers across different organizations,\u201d Lin said.<br/>\u00a0A key to the HHS rule is mandating a standard application program interface (API) across EHRs. The API is what enables third parties to access data and can be a powerful tool to help patients access their medical records, Lin says.<br/>\u201cFor example, Facebook and Apple both allow third party developers access to their API, which is what has led to the boom of different apps that people enjoy today,\u201d Lin said. \u201cImagine if your EHR could interface with apps that directly connect to your mobile device. As a patient, you might be able to exchange your healthcare data in real time as you visit the doctor\u2019s office using something like air drop, or develop apps that help you monitor chronic diseases like diabetes, or symptoms for Alzheimer\u2019s, or connect to social media data on asthma triggers to warn you about days that are likely to exacerbate an acute asthmatic event. The possibilities are endless.\u201d<br/>\u00a0Unfortunately, federal policy over the past two decades regarding the sharing of data has created confusion, Lin says.<br/>\u201cMisconceptions about HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) have created a culture in the U.S. where it is difficult and scary to share data,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIn actuality, HIPAA was designed to promote patient movement across organizations (the P stands for portability), however, there is so much concern about patient privacy, which is rooted in deep mistrust of institutions, that many (both patients and healthcare workers alike) have misconstrued HIPAA to be primarily about protecting patient privacy.\u201d<br/>As a result, there has been a proliferation of third parties managing EHRs for large health care organizations who have viewed their data collection as proprietary and defensible in the interest of patient privacy, Lin says.<br/>\u201cI think EHR vendors have emerged as the main winners,\u201d Lin said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data Privacy Concerns</emphasis><br/>Giving large technology companies access to data raises serious privacy concerns, says Michael Ciampi, a physician and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishes\u00a0Health Care News.<br/>\u00a0\u201cCompanies such as Microsoft and Apple are innovators and have developed technologies of which we could not have dreamed 20 years ago,\u201d Ciampi said. \u201cUnfortunately, we have seen recently that \u2018Big Tech\u2019 is relentless at gathering data on all of us.\u201d<br/>Tech companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google are not covered under HIPAA as health care entities but can get access to patient health information under a business \u201cassociate\u201d agreement with a health care provider. One such deal came to light in 2019 when the Wall Street Journal revealed an arrangement by Ascension Health to share millions of patient medical records with Google.<br/>HIPAA allows entities access to a person\u2019s most personal information, Ciampi says.<br/>\u201cI don\u2019t think most people understand this aspect of HIPAA,\u201d Ciampi said. \u201cIn many ways, it can compromise a patient\u2019s right to privacy more than it protects it. This is not a good thing.\u201d<br/>Ciampi says his concerns extend to EHRs.<br/>\u201cAs EHRs came into existence, all systems were proprietary and did not talk to one another,\u201d Ciampi said. \u201cAs they evolved, it was suggested by the industry, then mandated by the government, that they should have interoperability, so that information could be shared between doctors in different offices, hospitals, and healthcare systems across the country to maximize efficiency, eliminate duplication, and improve safety. Unfortunately, this goal remains quite far from reach.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Interoperability and Consumer Control</emphasis><br/>Interoperability can increase competition, which in turn can benefit consumers but it will require a new paradigm, says Lin.<br/>\u201cHistorically, it\u2019s been hard to share data between vendors for multiple reasons. I think the biggest reason is the way our culture views healthcare data,\u201d Lin said. \u201cHealth care providers value their medical data and for good reason: one could argue that in terms of economics, data production is the primary service of the medical system.<br/>\u201cWhen you go to the doctor, you are seeking an expert opinion on the diagnosis and treatment, which is essentially data,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIf healthcare organizations were to easily give that data up, there\u2019s nothing to stop patients from seeking a diagnosis from one doctor, and then giving their insurance dollars to another for treatment.<br/>\u201cHealth care organizations profit by recruiting experts in medical care, if the expertise were freely given away, they would lose their competitive edge, and potentially a lot of patient revenue,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t unsupported, new research supports the idea that sharing data does lead to more patient movement across organizations,\u201dsays Ciampi.<br/>\u201cIt would encourage health care systems and individual physician practices to shop around for newer, better, and less expensive systems rather than stay married to the legacy system in which they are trapped,\u201d Ciampi said. \u201cThat would be bad for their bottom line.\u201d<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-96630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNN-GGV1-DY1R-B012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT &amp;

On January 30, 2020, a group of nearly 30 industry groups and companies sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought advocating support for ONC and CMS' regulations.The Potential for PatientsChanges in policy could bring more functional accessibility for patients, say Sunny C. Lin, assistant professor of health systems management and policy at Oregon Health and Science University. 'HHS has a vision of creating an interoperable health information infrastructure, where information can follow a patient freely as they see providers across different organizations,' Lin said.A key to the HHS rule is mandating a standard application program interface (API) across EHRs. </p><p>The API is what enables third parties to access data and can be a powerful tool to help patients access their medical records, Lin says.'For example, Facebook and Apple both allow third party developers access to their API, which is what has led to the boom of different apps that people enjoy today,' Lin said. 'Imagine if your EHR could interface with apps that directly connect to your mobile device. As a patient, you might be able to exchange your healthcare data in real time as you visit the doctor's office using something like air drop, or develop apps that help you monitor chronic diseases like diabetes, or symptoms for Alzheimer's, or connect to social media data on asthma triggers to warn you about days that are likely to exacerbate an acute asthmatic event. The possibilities are endless.'Unfortunately, federal policy over the past two decades regarding the sharing of data has created confusion, Lin says.'Misconceptions about HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) have created a culture in the U.S. where it is difficult and scary to share data,' Lin said. 'In actuality, HIPAA was designed to promote patient movement across organizations (the P stands for portability), however, there is so much concern about patient privacy, which is rooted in deep mistrust of institutions, that many (both patients and healthcare workers alike) have misconstrued HIPAA to be primarily about protecting patient privacy.'As a result, there has been a proliferation of third parties managing EHRs for large health care organizations who have viewed their data collection as proprietary and defensible in the interest of patient privacy, Lin says.'I think EHR vendors have emerged as the main winners,' Lin said.Data Privacy ConcernsGiving large technology companies access to data raises serious privacy concerns, says Michael Ciampi, a physician and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishesHealth Care News.'Companies such as Microsoft and Apple are innovators and have developed technologies of which we could not have dreamed 20 years ago,' Ciampi said. 'Unfortunately, we have seen recently that 'Big Tech' is relentless at gathering data on all of us.'Tech companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google are not covered under HIPAA as health care entities but can get access to patient health information under a business 'associate' agreement with a health care provider. One such deal came to light in 2019 when the Wall Street Journal revealed an arrangement by Ascension Health to share millions of patient medical records with Google.HIPAA allows entities access to a person's most personal information, Ciampi says.'I don't think most people understand this aspect of HIPAA,' Ciampi said. 'In many ways, it can compromise a patient's right to privacy more than it protects it. This is not a good thing.'Ciampi says his concerns extend to EHRs.'As EHRs came into existence, all systems were proprietary and did not talk to one another,' Ciampi said. 'As they evolved, it was suggested by the industry, then mandated by the government, that they should have interoperability, so that information could be shared between doctors in different offices, hospitals, and healthcare systems across the country to maximize efficiency, eliminate duplication, and improve safety. Unfortunately, this goal remains quite far from reach.'Interoperability and Consumer ControlInteroperability can increase competition, which in turn can benefit consumers but it will require a new paradigm, says Lin.'Historically, it's been hard to share data between vendors for multiple reasons. I think the biggest reason is the way our culture views healthcare data,' Lin said. 'Health care providers value their medical data and for good reason: one could argue that in terms of economics, data production is the primary service of the medical system.'When you go to the doctor, you are seeking an expert opinion on the diagnosis and treatment, which is essentially data,' Lin said. 'If healthcare organizations were to easily give that data up, there's nothing to stop patients from seeking a diagnosis from one doctor, and then giving their insurance dollars to another for treatment.'Health care organizations profit by recruiting experts in medical care, if the expertise were freely given away, they would lose their competitive edge, and potentially a lot of patient revenue,' Lin said. 'This isn't unsupported, new research supports the idea that sharing data does lead to more patient movement across organizations,'says Ciampi.'It would encourage health care systems and individual physician practices to shop around for newer, better, and less expensive systems rather than stay married to the legacy system in which they are trapped,' Ciampi said. 'That would be bad for their bottom line.'Kelsey E.

On January 30, 2020, a group of nearly 30 industry groups and companies sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought advocating support for ONC and CMS' regulations.</p><p>The Potential for Patients</p><p>Changes in policy could bring more functional accessibility for patients, say Sunny C. Lin, assistant professor of health systems management and policy at Oregon Health and Science University.</p><p>\"HHS has a vision of creating an interoperable health information infrastructure, where information can follow a patient freely as they see providers across different organizations,\" Lin said.</p><p>A key to the HHS rule is mandating a standard application program interface (API) across EHRs. The API is what enables third parties to access data and can be a powerful tool to help patients access their medical records, Lin says.</p><p>\"For example, Facebook and Apple both allow third party developers access to their API, which is what has led to the boom of different apps that people enjoy today,\" Lin said. \"Imagine if your EHR could interface with apps that directly connect to your mobile device. As a patient, you might be able to exchange your healthcare data in real time as you visit the doctor's office using something like air drop, or develop apps that help you monitor chronic diseases like diabetes, or symptoms for Alzheimer's, or connect to social media data on asthma triggers to warn you about days that are likely to exacerbate an acute asthmatic event. The possibilities are endless.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, federal policy over the past two decades regarding the sharing of data has created confusion, Lin says.</p><p>\"Misconceptions about HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) have created a culture in the U.S. where it is difficult and scary to share data,\" Lin said. \"In actuality, HIPAA was designed to promote patient movement across organizations (the P stands for portability), however, there is so much concern about patient privacy, which is rooted in deep mistrust of institutions, that many (both patients and healthcare workers alike) have misconstrued HIPAA to be primarily about protecting patient privacy.\"</p><p>As a result, there has been a proliferation of third parties managing EHRs for large health care organizations who have viewed their data collection as proprietary and defensible in the interest of patient privacy, Lin says.</p><p>\"I think EHR vendors have emerged as the main winners,\" Lin said.</p><p>Data Privacy Concerns</p><p>Giving large technology companies access to data raises serious privacy concerns, says Michael Ciampi, a physician and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, which publishes Health Care News.</p><p>\"Companies such as Microsoft and Apple are innovators and have developed technologies of which we could not have dreamed 20 years ago,\" Ciampi said. \"Unfortunately, we have seen recently that 'Big Tech' is relentless at gathering data on all of us.\"</p><p>Tech companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google are not covered under HIPAA as health care entities but can get access to patient health information under a business \"associate\" agreement with a health care provider. One such deal came to light in 2019 when the Wall Street Journal revealed an arrangement by Ascension Health to share millions of patient medical records with Google.</p><p>HIPAA allows entities access to a person's most personal information, Ciampi says.</p><p>\"I don't think most people understand this aspect of HIPAA,\" Ciampi said. \"In many ways, it can compromise a patient's right to privacy more than it protects it. This is not a good thing.\"</p><p>Ciampi says his concerns extend to EHRs.</p><p>\"As EHRs came into existence, all systems were proprietary and did not talk to one another,\" Ciampi said. \"As they evolved, it was suggested by the industry, then mandated by the government, that they should have interoperability, so that information could be shared between doctors in different offices, hospitals, and healthcare systems across the country to maximize efficiency, eliminate duplication, and improve safety. Unfortunately, this goal remains quite far from reach.\"</p><p>Interoperability and Consumer Control</p><p>Interoperability can increase competition, which in turn can benefit consumers but it will require a new paradigm, says Lin.</p><p>\"Historically, it's been hard to share data between vendors for multiple reasons. I think the biggest reason is the way our culture views healthcare data,\" Lin said. \"Health care providers value their medical data and for good reason: one could argue that in terms of economics, data production is the primary service of the medical system.</p><p>\"When you go to the doctor, you are seeking an expert opinion on the diagnosis and treatment, which is essentially data,\" Lin said. \"If healthcare organizations were to easily give that data up, there's nothing to stop patients from seeking a diagnosis from one doctor, and then giving their insurance dollars to another for treatment.</p><p>\"Health care organizations profit by recruiting experts in medical care, if the expertise were freely given away, they would lose their competitive edge, and potentially a lot of patient revenue,\" Lin said. \"This isn't unsupported, new research supports the idea that sharing data does lead to more patient movement across organizations,\"says Ciampi.</p><p>\"It would encourage health care systems and individual physician practices to shop around for newer, better, and less expensive systems rather than stay married to the legacy system in which they are trapped,\" Ciampi said. \"That would be bad for their bottom line.\"</p><p>Kelsey E.

The whitepaper - authored by Robert Courtneidge, CEO of Moorwand and one of the world's top 10 payment lawyers - proposes regulatory principles for stablecoins like Facebook's Libra.Regulating Instability Coins is a meta-analysis of over 20 reports on the issue of stablecoins, including FATF's \"Guidance on virtual asset service providers\", the FCA's final \"Guidance on Cryptoassets\" and BIS's \"Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and Risks\". Based on this analysis, Robert sets out key recommendations for what regulators need to do to tackle the threat that stablecoins pose to the global financial system, and, in particular, central banks and traditional financial institutions. The recommendations cover both what can be done within existing law, as well as new principles that regulators must adopt if they want to ensure a level playing field between \u2018Big Tech' companies like Amazon and Facebook and traditional financial service providers.The whitepaper also covers:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Crypto evolution - from a cult-like niche to a fully-realised promise that will change the global financial system</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How stablecoin operators work outside of legislative protections, acting almost as a private central bank</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The growing tension between \u2018Big Tech' players, central banks and governments over control of monetary policy</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Why regulators need to prevent a bifurcation of the global financial system between sovereign and crypto</p></bodyText></listItem></list>\"Since it was announced on the 18th of June 2019, Facebook's Libra has received widespread attention partly due to its promise to become a true global digital currency,\" said Robert Courtneidge CEO of Moorwand. \"However, regulators are not being prepped to manage the challenges posed by Libra and other stable coins. Stable coins, delivered by \u2018Big Tech', are being given a free pass by regulators but must be held to the same standards as a bank or payments firm if they are to operate in the same space. \"Libra for example raises a number of concerns, one major issue being Facebook's sheer determination to find a host nation that will let it operate to its own advantage. Without a global regulatory response, Libra will be able to function as freely as its host nation's regulatory environment. Ultimately, if we are serious about holding \u2018Big Tech' to the same standards as the rest of the finance industry, then we must act. I believe this white paper sets out a clear set of recommendations for regulators to tackle the challenge of stable coins without quashing the innovations from crypto firms and \u2018Big Tech' players.\"The whitepaper is available for download here:https://www.moorwand.com/resources -Ends- About Moorwand<br/>Moorwand is a dedicated BIN sponsor, issuer and acquirer that turns compliance into competitive advantage for its clients.

The whitepaper - authored by Robert Courtneidge, CEO of Moorwand and one of the world's top 10 payment lawyers - proposes regulatory principles for stablecoins like Facebook's Libra.</p><p><br/><br/>Regulating Instability Coins is a meta-analysis of over 20 reports on the issue of stablecoins, including FATF's \"Guidance on virtual asset service providers\", the FCA's final \"Guidance on Cryptoassets\" and BIS's \"Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and Risks\".<br/><br/>Based on this analysis, Robert sets out key recommendations for what regulators need to do to tackle the threat that stablecoins pose to the global financial system, and, in particular, central banks and traditional financial institutions. The recommendations cover both what can be done within existing law, as well as new principles that regulators must adopt if they want to ensure a level playing field between 'Big Tech' companies like Amazon and Facebook and traditional financial service providers.<br/><br/>The whitepaper also covers:<br/><br/>*Crypto evolution - from a cult-like niche to a fully-realised promise that will change the global financial system<br/><br/>*How stablecoin operators work outside of legislative protections, acting almost as a private central bank<br/><br/>*The growing tension between 'Big Tech' players, central banks and governments over control of monetary policy<br/><br/>*Why regulators need to prevent a bifurcation of the global financial system between sovereign and crypto<br/><br/>\"Since it was announced on the 18th of June 2019, Facebook's Libra has received widespread attention partly due to its promise to become a true global digital currency,\" said Robert Courtneidge CEO of Moorwand. \"However, regulators are not being prepped to manage the challenges posed by Libra and other stable coins. Stable coins, delivered by 'Big Tech', are being given a free pass by regulators but must be held to the same standards as a bank or payments firm if they are to operate in the same space.<br/><br/>\"Libra for example raises a number of concerns, one major issue being Facebook's sheer determination to find a host nation that will let it operate to its own advantage. Without a global regulatory response, Libra will be able to function as freely as its host nation's regulatory environment. Ultimately, if we are serious about holding 'Big Tech' to the same standards as the rest of the finance industry, then we must act. I believe this white paper sets out a clear set of recommendations for regulators to tackle the challenge of stable coins without quashing the innovations from crypto firms and 'Big Tech' players.\"<br/><br/>The whitepaper is available for download here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moorwand.com/resources\">https://www.moorwand.com/resources</url><br/><br/>-Ends-<br/><br/>About Moorwand<br/><br/>Moorwand is a dedicated BIN sponsor, issuer and acquirer that turns compliance into competitive advantage for its clients.

You would think that after the NY Times had to roll back its own ridiculous headline blaming \"hate speech\" on the internet on Section 230, only to have to say \"oops, actually, it's the 1st Amendment,\"[1] that other publications would take the time to get things straight and recognize that nearly everything they're complaining about is actually the 1st Amendment[2], not Section 230. Section 230 merely protects the 1st Amendment[3], by making it easier to get out of SLAPPish lawsuits earlier in the process. Yet, Newsweek apparently did not take note, and agreed to publish an op-ed by a group that was set up with former Republican Congressional staffers to deliberately push FUD and nonsense about successful internet companies called the \"Internet Accountability Project\" (which is not accountable[4] for its own funding). IAP has been targeting Section 230 pretty much from day one, and this Newsweek op-ed is par for the course in that nearly everything it claims is wrong, misleading, or just ridiculous[5]. First it describes a few examples of both Facebook and Google moderating potentially dangerous misinformation campaigns about COVID-19 and claims that this is some sort of evil censorship:For speech, in particular, the consequences of tech's growing power have become increasingly plain. </p><p>In April, Facebook began removing content promoting anti-lockdown events. From ABC News to Politico[6], it was reported that this was being done at the behest of state governments. By the evening, Facebook clarified[7] that it would only be removing from its platform content pertaining to groups whose activities violated governments' social distancing guidance. In other words, Facebook is not removing protest content that is unlawful\u2014but rather, content that goes against state government \"advisories.\" That is, guidance without the force of law. On YouTube, owned by Google, a video of two emergency room doctors publicly questioning the official narrative about COVID-19 reportedly had over five million views before YouTube snatched it down, stating[8] the video \"violat[ed] our Community Guidelines, including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy [ sic] authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance.\"Note how this is framed -- as if removing disinformation or recommendations that will likely lead to people dying due to ignoring health advice regarding COVID-19 is somehow a bad thing. Meanwhile, of course, you have people at the other end of the political spectrum insisting (also incorrectly) that these platforms leave this kind of content up because of 230. So, which is it? Does 230 lead to platforms feeling comfortable leaving up dangerous nonsense or is it responsible for platforms taking down content?This type of private company censorship is allowed because of Sec. 230\u2014the part of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, which provides Big Tech special legal treatment.1. A private platform moderating nonsense is not censorship. 2. It's allowed because of the 1st Amendment. 3. It provides no special legal treatment to \"big tech.\" Literally every single thing in this is outright false. Newsweek's fact checkers apparently are on vacation.Sec. 230 was designed to allow platforms to remove \"obscene, lewd, lascivious...or otherwise objectionable\" content without being sued for doing so. But with the help of the courts, that targeted immunity privilege has been stretched to include, among other things, the enforcement of government-determined narratives against speech that would otherwise be constitutionally protected if it occurred outside these platforms and away from Sec. 230.This is a neat little attempt to rewrite the law, the legislative history, and the judicial rulings on the law all in one shot. Section 230 was designed to enable the platforms to make their own decisions with regards to moderation, without facing legal liability for those choices. And, honestly, is IAP's position that encouraging people to ignore important health information should not be seen as \"otherwise objectionable\"? Because that sure would be fascinating. And whether or not the speech is \"constitutionally protected\" is meaningless. The limitations on regulating speech apply to the government, not a private company. Indeed, a regulatory regime that required the hosting of speech would raise its own constitutional questions -- which IAP refuses to acknowledge.\"For a private company to simply delete the promotion of protests it deems unacceptable is a remarkable expansion of its power over what was once a sacrosanct and constitutionally protected freedom,\" wrote[9] one commentator recently. \"Through these private companies...government officials can in effect restrict speech they are obligated to protect.\"Notice that they say \"one commenter\" but don't note that it's a college student who apparently should go back and study the Constitution some more. A platform has every right to block the promotion of protests on its own platform. There are many other places that anyone who wants to protest can publish their protests, whether those are smart and useful protests, or dangerous lunacy (as the protests in question were).The companies and their advocates say this type of moderation is necessary to ensure free speech. But what does it mean for free speech when the major communications platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Google align themselves with the government to deem certain speech, which would otherwise be constitutionally protected, too dangerous?It means that every platform gets to choose. Some align themselves with government reports highlighting that the promotion of not social distancing might kill thousands of people. Some align themselves with ridiculous people who think that killing people and spreading a diseases is their god-given right. That's the nature of free-enterprise. I thought Republicans used to support that kinda thing? What happened?Rhetorically, it's an odd turn, as the antidote to bad or misleading speech is actually more speech\u2014the robust debate and engagement that shapes ideas, rebuts other ideas and reforms narratives. This is especially true in the sciences, whose entire history is an arc composed of overturning ideas once considered \"settled.\"It's true that the antidote to bad or misleading speech is more speech, but it doesn't mean that every platform must host that speech. They have other places they can speak, and they can (and have) build their own spaces as well.The most sinister thing about these decisions, however, is that when it comes to deciding what COVID-19 information we get to see, Big Tech companies have now become a de facto arm of the state.No. They haven't. Of course, if you get rid of CDA 230, then actually they might. Because then they may face liability for not pulling down enough content -- and if someone does something preternaturally stupid, like encouraging people to gather in large numbers without face masks and without social distancing in the midst of a deadly pandemic, then, you know, a platform without CDA 230 protections might face some amount of liability for the chaos that produces. That's part of what's so ridiculously frustrating here. If they got what they \"want\" it would make what they claim is the problem significantly worse. Of course, the reality is they don't actually want to get rid of Section 230. They just want to cause trouble for Google because their funders hate that they've been out innovated by internet companies.Far from private companies merely initiating their own content moderation, these platforms are now acting as enforcement wings for government-approved information campaigns. In Facebook's case, this means removing the ability of citizens to organize in a constitutionally protected activity\u2014an activity that is not illegal, but is merely advised against.Again, they're not. You want to know how I know? Because all of these platforms leave up tons of content that involves these kinds of protests and gatherings. Just because they pulled down some of the most ridiculous and most dangerous -- because they don't want people to fucking die -- does not mean that they are \"enforcement wings for government-approved information campaigns.\" And again, without 230, if someone died because they went to one of these protests, how quickly do you think Facebook would get sued because it hosted the details of the protest?Sec. 230\u2014the sweetheart deal that allows tech to censor content without the same consequences as, say, the newspaper industry\u2014is, at its root, a congressionally authorized tech industry subsidy. It has allowed the industry to grow from dorm rooms and garage basements to billion-dollar omnipresent mega corporations.Section 230 was not a sweetheart deal, and it does not apply to just tech. Newspapers rely on Section 230 too. It is not a \"subsidy\" it's about the correct application of liability to avoid nonsense lawsuits (also, weren't Republicans historically against frivolous lawsuits and ambulance chasing? Without 230 you'd open up a huge rush of tort cases).And in that regard, Sec. 230 is not unlike the host of other subsidies the government provides to various industries: expensing provisions given to manufacturers, the federal assistance we provide farmers to purchase crop insurance and so forth. These industries will tell you that these provisions are vital to their survival\u2014and they might be right. But that hasn't prevented them from being routinely debated, updated or otherwise modified.But it's not even remotely a subsidy. It's just making it clear who has the liability. That's it. That's all it is. And, again, the 1st amendment protects the activities that this article mistakenly thinks 230 protects. All 230 does is a procedural move to help identify who should be liable for what. That's it.If COVID-19 has proven anything about Big Tech, it is that these companies have accumulated orders of magnitude more power than politicians could have imagined just a decade ago. That power has benefited us, but it has also threatened us. An intellectually honest assessment of its ramifications is now desperately needed.And one thing you will never get from the Internet Accountability Project is even a sliver of \"an intellectually honest assessment.\" It is a bad faith player, funded by bad faith companies, to do bad faith things -- like publishing this utter nonsense piece of pure fiction in a mainstream publication. Newsweek should not have taken the bait. Oh, but let me save the final nonsense for last. Right beneath this post, Newsweek is advertising medical nonsense and miracle treatments.<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/nQh0E2aOf\">https://imgur.com/nQh0E2aOf</url> course, Newsweek isn't liable for pushing people to that medical snake oil... because of Section 230's protections. Which it has now apparently decided it's okay to get rid of. Good one, Newsweek. Good one.

Maybe it's not surprising, then, that the original 1931 edition had so much to say about leftovers. Rombauer carefully inventoried all the recipes in the book that could serve as vessels for leftovers, and she enthusiastically detailed her favorite all-purpose techniques, such as folding chopped leftovers (it didn't really matter what) into waffle batter or mixing them with cream sauce and stuffing them into hollowed-out vegetables. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; China's\u00a0Stocks Rise After Trading Break Amid Targeted Stimulus[36]\u00a0(Bloomberg)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Chinas stocks rose as trading resumed after a week-long holiday and the government took steps to boost the economy. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Morgan\u00a0Stanley Bond Team Faces the Unexpected: Can Fed Avoid QE?[37]\u00a0(Bloomberg)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; A year that started with almost everyone calling for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is drawing to a close with\u00a0one of the world's largest bond dealers saying there's increasing chatter about the need for additional\u00a0stimulus. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Politics&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Hillary\u00a0Clinton has broken with Obama on a major cornerstone of his legacy[38]\u00a0(Business Insider)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that \"as of today\" she opposes the major trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major break with an administration that considers the deal a\u00a0cornerstone of US President Barack Obama's foreign-policy legacy[39]. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; \"As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,\" the Democratic presidential front-runner\u00a0told PBS's Judy Woodruff[40]\u00a0in an interview during a campaign swing in Iowa. \"I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.\" &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Supporters of Donald Trump and other Republicans get worst grammar grades[41]\u00a0(Market Watch)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Donald Trump may be leading his rival Republican presidential aspirants in the polls, but, when it comes to his supporters' facility with grammar, he's running dead last. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; And, according to the Presidential Debate Grammar Power Rankings survey \u2014 conducted by the Grammarly blog \u2014 Republican supporters, overall, trail Democratic candidates' backers in grammar skills. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Conde\u00a0Seeks Guinea Election Win as Power Investments Deliver[42]\u00a0(Bloomberg)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Guinean President\u00a0Alpha Conde strengthened his bid for a second term in Oct. 11 elections against a divided opposition by securing a steady energy supply and keeping the military out of politics to shore up a transition from dictatorship to democracy. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Technology&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Track\u00a0Your Carbon Footprint On Your Wrist[43]\u00a0(PSFK)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Worldbeing[44]\u00a0is a wearable and app developed by design agency Layer, which aims to deliver experiences for the physical and digital worlds.

Though battery technologies have come a long way in the last decade, with 100 miles on a charge being common and Teslas easily topping 200 miles, people still want to know they can take off on a family vacation or a weekend away. Road trip! &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; A French company has a cute solution to this problem:\u00a0EP Tender[46], a generator housed in a little two-wheeled trailer pulled by your EV.

&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Bariatric surgery[49]\u00a0may be one of these, because it could increase a person's risk of self-harm, according to a new study. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Life on the Home

Trial in the case began Monday, with the government asking the judge for an injunction to stop the deal. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Politics&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Your state is probably even more corrupt than you thought[30]\u00a0(Market Watch)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Michigan may be the worst, but no state was spared a lousy grade in\u00a0a recent study from the Center for Public Integrity[31], a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that took a look at rules and systems on government transparency and accountability across the country. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; 'The comprehensive probe found that in state after state, open records laws are laced with exemptions, and part-time legislators and agency officials engage in glaring conflicts of interests and cozy relationships with lobbyists,' CPI's Nicholas Kusnetz wrote.

While it\u00a0hasn't quite taken off[34]\u00a0to revolutionize the way consumer products are made just yet, it does offer a lot of exciting, innovative ideas, especially in the realm of sneakers. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, a group focused on research into\u00a0'active' materials[35], is working in collaboration with product designers Christophe Guberan and Carlo Clopath on one of the most unique footwear possibilities involving 3D printing: It's a shoe that can be 'programmed' to match the contours of your foot. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Google\u00a0Seeks to Influence AI Research by Giving Software Away[36]\u00a0(Bloomberg)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Google wants to set the standard on artificial intelligence. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The Web company, seeking to influence how people design, test, and run artificial-intelligence systems, is making its internal AI development software available for free. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The Alphabet Inc.-subsidiary is releasing a program called TensorFlow as freely available open-source software, it said Monday. It's based on the same internal system Google has spent several years developing to support its AI software and other mathematically complex programs. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Adidas's\u00a0Latest \"Futurecraft\" Shoes Are Made From One Seamless Piece Of Leather[37]\u00a0(Fast Company)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; By carefully shaving away layers of leather, Adidas can make one piece work like many. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; At first glance, Adidas's new shoe looks like their iconic\u00a0Superstar[38], just sewn up in leather. That is, until you look closer at the toe box, ankle, those three stripes. You see that's not stitching holding the shoe together. Actually, that's not\u00a0anything\u00a0holding the shoe together. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Health and Life Sciences&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Scientists\u00a0make skin's stretchy stuff in the lab[39]\u00a0(Futurity)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Extracellular matrix is the material that gives tissues like skin, cartilage, or tendon their strength and stretch. It's been hard to make well in the lab, but scientists report new success. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The key was creating a culture environment that guided cells to make extracellular matrix (ECM) themselves. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; In the journal\u00a0Biomaterials[40], the team reports culturing cells to make ECM of two types and five different alignments with the strength found in natural tissue and without using any artificial chemicals that could make it incompatible to implant. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Data\u00a0on Benefits of Lower Blood Pressure Brings Clarity for Doctors and Patients[41]\u00a0(NY Times)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; When the federal government announced in September that it had abruptly halted a large\u00a0blood pressure[42]\u00a0study because its results were so compelling, doctors were left in frustrating limbo. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The\u00a0announcement[43]\u00a0said researchers had found that driving\u00a0systolic blood pressure[44]\u00a0to levels far below what current guidelines recommend \u2014 less than 120 instead of 140 or 150 millimeters of mercury \u2014 can save lives and prevent heart disease and strokes. But they declined to release any data on the number of lives saved, the number of heart attacks prevented or other critical measures. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Life on the Home Planet&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; What\u00a0Would A Bodhisattva Do?[45]\u00a0(Huffington Post)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; From the\u00a0fourth perspective[46]\u00a0you look at the world through the mind; from the fifth perspective, you look at the world through the heart. In the fourth perspective you identify with no one; in the fifth perspective, you identify with everyone. The fourth perspective is wisdom; the fifth perspective is compassion. In the fourth perspective you are no one to become everyone; in the fifth perspective, you are the only One. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; In the fourth perspective you have no desire; in the fifth perspective, you want the best for everyone. From the fifth perspective you see what is on its way towards becoming the best it could be. Furthermore, your intention is to help every one grow and be happy. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Johannesburg\u00a0limits water use as drought worsens[47]\u00a0(Phys)&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city and economic hub, on Monday imposed emergency water restrictions as supplies deteriorated due to a drought, the worst to ravage the country in three decades. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; \"We are pleading with our customers to take more precautionary measures on how to use the water,\" the city's environmental affairs spokesman Anda Mbikwana told AFP. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; The decision was prompted by a warning from Rand Water, the country's main water utility, early Monday that supplies were declining.&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url

But where the Heck is the Money?[1]\u00a0(Wolf Street) There is a misconception about the uncanny ability of very profitable US companies, like Microsoft and Apple, to park their profits overseas in order to dodge US taxes: the money from these profits that are parked 'overseas' isn't actually overseas. Dollar\u00a0Rally Has Legs as Fed Divergence Trade Comes Back to Life[2]\u00a0(Bloomberg) The dollar's two-week rally has room to run, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u00a0citing scope for greenback strength versus the yen, while Bank of America Corp.</p><p>projects gains against the pound and the Australian dollar. The real cost of big tech's accounting games[3]\u00a0(FT) How much did\u00a0LinkedIn[4]\u00a0make over the past three years? Sounds a simple enough question doesn't it? But it is also one that is capable of being answered in multiple and very diverse ways. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is getting in the bidding war for Yahoo[5]\u00a0(Business Insider) Berkshire Hathaway's billionaire CEO, Warren Buffett, and Quicken Loans founder <person><nameText>Dan Gilbert </nameText></person>are part of a group that's bidding for Yahoo's internet assets,\u00a0according to Reuters on Friday[6]. The\u00a0rise and fall of Theranos, in one graphic[7]\u00a0(Business Insider) When Silicon Valley venture capitalists get themselves into image trouble, it's usually because they've been too candid with their low estimate of other people's intelligence. China\u00a0Processes Record Crude on Boost From Independent Refiners[8]\u00a0(Bloomberg) China processed record crude on a daily basis in April as the nation's independent plants boosted operations amid a surge in oil imports. Italy must choose between the euro and its own economic survival[9]\u00a0(Telegraph) Italy is running out of economic time. Seven years into an ageing global expansion, the country is still stuck in debt-deflation and still grappling with a banking crisis that it cannot combat within the paralyzing constraints of monetary union. China's\u00a0Economy Loses Momentum in April, Clouding Policy Outlook[10]\u00a0(Bloomberg) China's economy resumed its grind toward slower growth in April, weighed down by overcapacity industries such as steel and coal. The Target boycott has reached a boiling point \u2014 and sales may suffer as a result[11]\u00a0(Business Insider) Target is facing a nationwide backlash for its support of transgender rights. Greek Bonds Show Sign of Hope Before Decision on Bailout Payment[12]\u00a0(Bloomberg) As Greece attempts to clear another hurdle on the road to passing the next bailout review, the bond market is already delivering a positive verdict. Index Investing Makes Markets and Economies More Efficient[13]\u00a0(Philosophical Economics) U.S. equity index funds have grown\u00a0dramatically[14]\u00a0in recent decades, from a negligible $500MM in assets in the early 1980s to a staggering $4T\u00a0today. AEP: Euro-MPs fire thundering warning shot against China over trade terms[15]\u00a0(Telegraph) The European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to deny China the coveted prize of market economy status, warning that it would leave Europe's battered industries vulnerable to a devastating flood of subsidized Chinese goods. The\u00a0Deepest Motivation Fueling Trading Success[16]\u00a0(Trader Feed) Note that it is *not* saying that the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams. Rather, the future belongs to those who tap into the beauty of their dreams. Politics How\u00a0Republicans Finally Got a Victory on Obamacare[17]\u00a0(The Atlantic) For the last five years, Republicans in Congress have adopted a rather simple and old-fashioned strategy for going after Obamacare: Throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. Will a President Trump Still Be the King of Debt?[18]\u00a0(Bloomberg View) The presumptive Republican nominee for president has spent the last several days scrambling to clarify his self-contradictory statements on everything from tax reform and the minimum wage to interest rates and the national debt. Technology Meet The New Mavericks: An Inside Look At America's Drone Training Program[19]\u00a0(Fast Company) On most weekday mornings, Crystal drops her daughter, Bianca, at school before driving through downtown Alamogordo, New Mexico, a town of 31,000 people in the Chihuahuan Desert, on her way to work. She and her husband, Luis, coordinate after-school care and pick-up, and by the time the sun sets over White Sands Missile Range, the sky aflame with ragged streaks of pink, they're both home with Bianca for dinner and homework. Is Big Data Taking Us Closer to the Deeper Questions in Artificial Intelligence?[20]\u00a0(Edge) What we need to do in artificial intelligence is\u00a0turn back to psychology. Brute force is great; we're using it in a lot of ways, like\u00a0speech recognition, license plate recognition, and for categorization, but there are still some things that people do a lot better. We should be studying human beings to understand how they do it better. Health and Life Sciences Opioid Addiction Is a Huge Problem, but Pain Prescriptions Are Not the Cause[21]\u00a0(Scientific American) Both the FDA and the CDC have recently taken steps to address an epidemic of opioid overdose and addiction, which is now\u00a0killing[22]\u00a0some 29,000 Americans each year. But these regulatory efforts will fail unless we acknowledge that the problem is actually driven by illicit\u2014not medical\u2014drug use. Could a Few Extra Pounds Help You Live Longer?[23]\u00a0(Scientific American) People who are slightly overweight but not obese\u2014as defined by theirbody mass index[24]\u00a0(BMI)\u2014 tend to live longer than their normal-weight counterparts, according to\u00a0a new Danish study[25]. But that has not always been the case. In the 1970s, the Danish data show, study subjects with the best chance of living longer tended to have a BMI in the normal range, defined as being between 18.5 and 25. Someone who is 1.65 meters (five feet, four inches) tall and weighs 68 kilograms (150 pounds) would have a BMI of 25. The Cure for Fear[26]\u00a0(New Republic) Karin Klaver woke in the darkness and searched the nightstand for her iPhone. It was 2 a.m. Her husband slept quietly beside her. They had arrived in Johannesburg early that morning on the red-eye from Amsterdam and spent the day window shopping and people watching in the city. 'This is nice,' Klaver had thought to herself as she and her husband relaxed on the outdoor terrace of a shopping mall. Life on the Home Planet Suffocating the Ocean[27]\u00a0(Pacific Standard) It was crabbers who first reported something amiss. In 2002, they began pulling in traps full of corpses. (Crabs should be alive when you catch them.) And they mentioned something else: Little octopuses had followed their crab lines to the surface, as if fleeing inhospitable conditions below.

And it wasn't pretty.  Like many big asset managers, Janus Capital Group is caught on the wrong side of two powerful trends that are reshaping the financial industry.  The market looks eerily similar to the days right before the 1987 crash[3] (Business Insider) Financial advisers and market strategists usually warn their clients that the market's performance in the past is not a reliable guide for its future moves.  But when Citi's Tom Fitzpatrick and his team overlaid the current chart of the benchmark S...00 with the index in 1987 \u2014 right before the crash \u2014 they got \"the chills.\"        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rt.com/op-edge/362254-us-finance-deutsche-bank/Deutsche\">https://www.rt.com/op-edge/362254-us-finance-deutsche-bank/Deutsche</url> Bank bankruptcy would collapse world financial system - Jim Rogers[4] (RT) The main reason the US government wants $14 billion in penalties from the German bank is that it is deep in debt. They've got a gigantic deficit - they are desperate for money. They'll try to get it anywhere they can, Jim Rogers, financial commentator and investor, told RT.  Emerging-Market Stocks Edge Higher As REITs Tumble[5] (The Capital Spectator) The\u00a0major asset classes[6]\u00a0dispensed a wide range of performances last week, based on a set of proxy ETFs. Although losses dominated the five trading days through Oct. 7, a handful of markets bucked the trend, led by equities in emerging markets. But the week was overshadowed by the red ink brigade, with US real estate investment trusts (REITs) suffering the biggest setback.  Goldman Reveals How China Is Covering Up Hundreds Of Billions In Capital Outflows[7] (Zero Hedge) In order to mask the tremendous capital outflows leaving its country - in order to prevent and/or delay a depositor panic - China has resorted to various gimmicks: back in October, we reported that the first one involved\u00a0[8]the PBOC gradually shifting from FX spot intervention to the using forwards as a preferred mechanism of market intervention as it is not as obvious, or as transparent to detect, to wit: \"we need to take account not only of the PBoC's non-spot market intervention efforts in the offshore market, but also of banks' forward books if we want to get a better read on capital outflows in China.\"  GoldmanWarns China's Outflows May Be Worse Than They Look[9]\u00a0(Bloomberg) China's currency outflows may be bigger than they look, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc warning that a rising amount of capital is exiting the country in yuan rather than in dollars.   Goldman Tells Clients To Go To Cash As \"Growth Shocks\" Are Coming[10] (Zero Hedge) After last week's warning by Ray Dalio that a 100 bps rise in yields could lead to trillions in cross-asset losses, it was Goldman's turn to pick up the bearish torch with a note in which it warned that stock markets are set for volatility in the remainder of the year as a result of potential \"growth shocks\" which continue to loom until year-end as political risks remain elevated, given the upcoming US presidential elections and Italian referendum, and the UK government's plan to trigger Article 50 by March 2017.  My $200,000 college debt is like a growing cancer[11] (The Guardian) Every credit card rejection letter I get looks the same to me: a form letter, written without care or thought, releasing a new sense of failure as the paper unfolds. It's not that my credit is bad - far from it, actually. It's just that I'm incredibly in debt. Which is also why I can't buy a new house, get approved for a rental or get a new car. I owe more than four times what I make in a year, and I have my education to thank for it.        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-10/hart-and-holmstroem-awarded-2016-nobel-prize-in-economicsHarvard\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-10/hart-and-holmstroem-awarded-2016-nobel-prize-in-economicsHarvard</url> and MIT Economists Share Nobel for Contract Theory[12] (Bloomberg) Harvard University's Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m of the\u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics for laying the groundwork for contract theory and its role in shaping everything from executive pay to privatizations.  The Fed Who Cried Growth[13] (Value Walk) The FOMC has consistently overestimated future Fed Funds Rate (FFR) hikes. For a body that prides itself on super-scientific research methods and has teams of economists (self-described) and statisticians, it's interesting that they can't even predict their own behavior.  Ten Economic Questions for 2016[14]\u00a0(Calculated Risk) At the end of last year, I posted\u00a0Ten Economic Questions for 2016[15]. I followed up with a brief post on each question. The goal was to provide an overview of what I expected in 2016 (I don't have a crystal ball, but I think it helps to outline what I think will happen - and understand - and change my mind, when the outlook is wrong).

Business Insider compared prices on 31 identical items at Walmart and Target stores in Richmond, Virginia, to find out which store was cheaper.  J.P.

Coke and Pepsi Give Millions to Public Health, Then Lobby Against It[21] (NY Times) The beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have given millions of dollars to nearly 100 prominent health groups in recent years, while simultaneously spending millions to defeat public health legislation that would reduce Americans' soda intake, according to public health researchers.

The loss stemmed from Trump's investments in the early 1990s.  Warren Buffett fires back at Donald Trump's comments about his taxes[25] (CNBC) Warren Buffett[26]\u00a0responded Monday to\u00a0Donald Trump[27]'s attacks on his tax payments, offering income tax information and criticizing the Republican presidential nominee for not releasing his own tax records.

The tax would apply to digital companies with global revenue of at least $845 million or \u20ac750 million, and sales of $28 million or \u20ac25 million in France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under that structure, some of Silicon Valley\u2019s titans like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon would be hit with the tax, drawing claims from the Trump administration that U.S. companies are being discriminated against.</p><p>On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced the United States is \u201cvery concerned\u201d the so-called digital services tax \u201cunfairly targets American companies.\" His office launched an investigation into the effects of the measure under Section 301 of the Trade Act, which Trump has used to hit China with tariffs amid escalating trade tensions.</p><p>France so far seems undeterred in its effort to impose the tax on digital services, and the country is joined by the United Kingdom, which unveiled draft legislation Thursday to apply a similar levy.</p><p>The plan from the United Kingdom, first announced in October with an implementation date of April 2020, would slap a 2% tax on digital services from companies with annual global revenue exceeding $627 million or \u20ac500 million.</p><p>\"This targeted and proportionate Digital Services Tax is designed to keep our tax system in this area both fair and competitive, pending a longer term international settlement,\" Treasury Minister Jesse Norman said in a statement.</p><p>The efforts come as the European Union and the United States are seeking better regulation of internet companies that have come under fire for their collection of user data and handling of private information. Companies, particularly the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, have also been working to better identify and remove harmful content, though those efforts have been aided by artificial intelligence tools. </p><p>While France is forging ahead with the tax, the Trump administration said it intends to continue efforts with members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u201cto reach a multilateral agreement to address the challenges to the international tax system posed by an increasingly digitized global economy.\u201d</p><p>If the president were to impose duties on Paris as punishment for the tax on digital companies, France would join a growing list of foreign nations threatened with tariffs. Trump has already hiked levies up to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese goods but backed off his threat to hit the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports with sanctions after meeting with President Xi Jinping at the G-20 last month.</p><p>Trump also sent the U.S. auto industry, already struggling, into a frenzy last month when he said his administration would be slapping punitive levies of 5% on all goods imported from Mexico because of the country\u2019s handling of illegal immigration. The president abandoned the proposed duties, however, after Mexico agreed to a series of measures designed to stem the flow of migrants crossing the southern border. </p><p>Trump has not been shy about his affinity for using duties as leverage over other countries. As recently as Friday morning, the president reiterated his desire to impose tariffs on products shipped to the U.S., calling them a \u201cgreat negotiating tool\u201d and \u201cgreat revenue producer.\u201d</p><p>TweetStory URLPhoto Caption:A man using a mobile phone walks past Google offices in New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2257101228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPV-2TH1-JBHT-D51J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

It is now part of everyday life and developing at such a speed that legislators and governments are struggling to keep up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have just started using a Google Home device in the Umunna household. It's a smart speaker similar to Amazon Alexa that answers your questions, gets the news, plays songs, and enables you to control other apps, (like Spotify), hands free, using your own voice. We weren't really following yesterday's Wimbledon men's final so during the match I asked Google Home and it told me what the current score was.</p><p>According to a report from this January, almost a quarter (21 per cent) of adults in the US now own a smart speaker with the figures rising, and here in the UK we seem to be following the same trend. At the very least, policymakers need to be consistent in their approach to the ever increasing tech usage - but this is not the case at present.</p><p>One example is the US authorities. On the one hand, they seem keen to ensure that the enormous tech companies play by the rules and contribute to the common good. So at the end of last week the US Federal Trade Commission (which performs much the same functions as the UK's Consumer and Markets Authority) reportedly approved a $5bn (\u00a34bn) settlement with Facebook over allegations that the latter had inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now defunct Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.</p><p>On the other hand, in a knee-jerk response coloured by economic nationalism, Donald Trump has threatened to hit French goods with extra tariffs in retaliation for the French government announcing last week the imposition of a 3 per cent levy on large, mostly US, digital companies' local revenues.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron's administration in Paris is of the view that the tech companies are paying little or no tax. The French tech tax will apply to tech companies with global sales of over Euro 750m (\u00a3673m) which make more than Euro 25m in France.</p><p>The advent of new technologies, the rise of automation, artificial intelligence and digitisation has brought many benefits, facilitating better and more efficient methods of communication, knowledge acquisition, working, shopping, spending our leisure time, travelling and generally organising our lives. It has the potential to revolutionise public services.</p><p>But the advent of the new super-tech platforms in particular has concentrated power and wealth in the hands of a small number of people, new technologies are being used to facilitate abuse, crime and terrorism and to enable foreign powers to challenge our democratic processes and national security. One need only look at the increasing amount of police time and resources taken up with dealing with cybercrime and online fraud to see the downside.</p><p>Vast quantities of our personal data is now held by others, not necessarily within our control, and public policy and legal frameworks are struggling to keep pace. We cannot stand idly by and not intervene in the public interest to address these problems.</p><p>Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has talked about Labour's answer to all of this being \"socialism with an iPad\", meaning making Britain a leading power in technology. It's a good sound bite but the ideological dogma of yesteryear can't provide a comprehensive route map to the solutions to these very modern of issues.</p><p>The old, left-right fulcrum, around which politics revolved in the 20th century, is not an appropriate prism through which to view these very 21st century challenges. We want our data privacy respected as a core property right - a right-wing proposition - but to get the best rewards from the data revolution we need universal access to data, public platforms, and high accountability and transparency - left-wing propositions. It follows that we shouldn't pretend the answers will exclusively come from either ideological predisposition. So what should our approach be in ensuring these new technologies are used for the common good at home and abroad?</p><p>Britain needs a sophisticated, multitrack approach. The first track must be about making the most of the opportunities these technologies present in the UK. That means using all the levers of government to encourage the take-up and adoption of them which will help massively increase UK productivity, necessary to facilitate higher wages.</p><p>In addition, this will help ensure we create new jobs in this country to replace those displaced by automation and technological advance. Reindustrialising those areas which have been deindustrialised over time with these new industries must be a priority.</p><p>The second track should focus on using the new technologies to improve public service delivery. They can help accelerate and optimise administrative processes and improve citizens' experience of various services which can often be slow and inefficient. The efficiency gains will also save the Exchequer a lot of money which could be better used in other ways.</p><p>The third track must be about setting the right limits on these new technologies. They carry risks which are increasingly a focus of public debate: invasion of privacy, bullying or monopolistic behaviour by digital giants, misuse of personal data, tax evasion by firms with \"intangible\" profits, reckless testing and commercialisation of new technologies like driverless cars and private drones, the harnessing of such technologies by security threats, like criminals and terrorists, and geopolitical challengers, like China, which is increasingly integrating its AI strategies with its foreign policy.</p><p>The final track should address ownership and equality because too many of the rewards of these new technologies accrue to a relatively small number of individuals, exacerbating inequalities. New ownership structures must be developed to ensure greater distribution of the benefits - both to workers and wider society.</p><p>Our goal must be a constantly evolving body of democratised and repurposed regulation that tracks the realities of new technologies as they emerge and are applied, and starts from the principle that citizens, not governments or firms, should have the most power.</p><p>President Macron gets this. It is quite clear that Trump with his narrow nationalism does not. If the big tech companies are all made to pay their fair share and abide by the rules, all peoples and their governments - including Trump's - will benefit.</p><p>Chuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000031940469-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-GH61-JCS0-D011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1097\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mark Zuckerberg spent Wednesday trying to persuade lawmakers that Facebook's acquisitions and cloning of competitors' products and features haven't amounted to monopolistic behavior[5], and that it has plenty of competition[6].But when Zuckerberg first expressed interest in buying Instagram in 2012, cofounder Kevin Systrom didn't appear confident about what would happen if he opted to remain independent.\"Will [Zuckerberg] go into destroy mode if I say no [to an acquisition deal]?\" Systrom asked in a message to Benchmark Capital's Matt Cohler, according to documents published by the House Judiciary Committee[7] as part of its antitrust hearing on Wednesday.\"Probably,\" replied Cohler, an early Facebook employee-turned-VC who had invested in Instagram and was on its board of directors.Cohler also warned that Zuckerberg was unlikely to be deterred by the fact that Instagram was keen on raising additional startup funding.\"He'll go harder into destroy mode,\" Cohler told Systrom.The names in the text transcript are redacted, but the committee's website[8] identifies the two participants in the conversation as Systrom and Cohler. </p><p>\"Mark doesn't react emotionally, he reacts based on competition\" Systrom and Cohler went on to strategize around how to best respond to Zuckerberg's probe, weighing options like downplaying Instagram's strength and saying the product wouldn't be a good fit or able to succeed within Facebook.But two things they seemed to agree on: Zuckerberg was most worried about Instagram getting bought up by Twitter, and they were worried about Zuckerberg trying to crush Instagram if they refused to sell.\"If i make the 'leave instagram alone for Facebook's sake' argument, [Zuckerberg] will conclude that it's best to crush instagram,\" Cohler said, implying that they wouldn't be able to fend off Facebook just by floating the possibility of selling to Twitter.Ultimately, Systrom and Cohler concluded during the text exchange that Instagram needed to keep raising money and they needed to convince Zuckerberg that they weren't a threat to Facebook.\"Mark doesn't react emotionally, he reacts based on competition,\" Systrom said, \"that's why i think signaling no competition is good.\"\"Bottom line I don't think we'll ever escape the wrath of mark,\" he added. \"It just depends how long we avoid it.\"Facebook eventually got its way just two months after the exchange, buying Instagram for $1 billion[9] in April 2012. The price tag seemed massive at the time, but Instagram reportedly brought in $20 billion in revenue[10] for Facebook last year alone and has the second-most number of monthly users in the US, according to eMarketer[11].Facebook's acquisition of Instagram has since come under scrutiny from regulators and politicians who argue it amounted to anti-competitive practices. Zuckerberg faced multiple questions on the topic Wednesday, and argued that Facebook still faces lots of competition.\"The most popular messaging service in the US is iMessage,\" Zuckerberg told lawmakers. \"The fastest-growing app is TikTok. The most popular app for video is YouTube. The fastest growing ads platform is Amazon. The largest ads platform is Google. And for every dollar spent on advertising in the US, less than 10 cents is spent with us.\"Still, the committee obtained large numbers of documents from Facebook and others companies as part of its antitrust investigation, including emails where Zuckerberg said he viewed Instagram as a significant threat to Facebook's business before acquiring it[12].

The new research \u2013 based on survey responses from 130 senior decision makers representing a diverse range of financial companies across the UK \u2013 reports that a vast majority (84%) are investing in Open Banking products and services. 44% are also considering launching new products or services to improve the Open Banking experience for customers. A significant majority (77%) say Open Banking and PSD2 is one of the most radical changes in recent history for financial services, with 35% saying they strongly agree. </p><p> However, more than half (53%) of respondents say the industry has found it difficult to adapt to these new regulations. Despite high levels of enthusiasm and investment, many financial services firms \u2013 both banks and non-banks such as fintechs and payment services providers \u2013 are struggling to formulate and implement comprehensive strategies to deal with Open Banking. Two thirds (62%) say they do not have a comprehensive strategy in place and 13% have no investment strategy at all.  Looming competitive threats, including from big tech  Financial services companies are also clearly worried about competitive threats in the wake of the implementation of Open Banking, the research finds. In particular, banks see \u2018big tech\u2019 companies \u2013 such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2013 as the biggest perceived competitive threat in the Open Banking space (63%). 45% of non-banks agree. Other threats come from within the existing ecosystem of banks, challengers and fintechs.  Two thirds (66%) of respondents believe the market will ultimately become more consolidated with larger banks and corporates buying fintech businesses and smaller banks to keep pace with the level of innovation and speed of product development required to make a success of Open Banking.    Even amidst myriad challenges and competitive threats, respondents suggest Open Banking is on track to achieve the aspirations of the industry's regulators.  More than two-thirds say that Open Banking, once fully implemented, will bring greater innovation to the industry (70%) and more choice for customers (65%), while half agree it will enable greater customer control of banking data and services (50%) and easier industry collaboration (48%). Overall, a large majority (72%) believe that Open Banking has been a positive step forward for the industry.  David Gardner, partner in the financial services team at TLT, commented: \"Our research reveals the true scale of disruption that financial services companies are grappling with, alongside the opportunities that these far-reaching changes have created \u2013 provided that companies can keep up with the pace of change. It is encouraging to see that the vast majority of respondents hold Open Banking up as a positive initiative and \u2013 despite the challenges with defining a clear Open Banking strategy \u2013 the industry is not standing still.     \"Innovation is happening all the time as more participants define their strategy and find new ways to collaborate,, which is creating a huge sense of anticipation in the market. The race is on for every participant to identify their position and launch a \"killer app\" or product to capture that opportunity. Open Banking will open up the market to new participants and continue to drive disruption for all. This could result in a more polarised market, split between niche offerings and financial services platforms, and between those who embrace agile transformation and those that are more reactive and slower to adapt.  \"There are considerable challenges for existing players and new entrants \u2013 from complying with regulatory technical standards to identifying market opportunities and potential partnerships and making sure that customer data is adequately protected. Customer confidence and trust must be a major area of focus in order to realise the potential benefits that Open Banking can deliver. Would-be Open Banking champions need to consider their position, their partners and their strategy carefully, but make sure they can act and react quickly enough to take full advantage, before someone else does.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN629035520181122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TT4-FGF1-J9XT-P2YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, he said, his office needs new tools to more effectively regulate the digital economy.</p><p>Boswell said his office lacks the power to conduct market studies, including the information-gathering abilities found in most developed jurisdictions. Canada is also the only major economy to have an \"efficiencies defence\" in competition cases \"which can allow mergers that potentially hamper competition and which, some say, is particularly ill suited for the digital economy,\" he said.</p><p>Boswell said the federal Competition Bureau also has to improve the technology it uses to handle evidence needed to police the digital economy. The bureau's ongoing investigation of bread price-fixing by grocery stores has gathered 100 terabytes of data, requiring specialized tools to analyze and review the records.</p><p>To help deal with the challenges, the bureau has created a new position of chief digital enforcement officer to help position the bureau as one of the world's leading competition regulators in the digital economy, Boswell said.</p><p>Among the issues the bureau will be examining is whether data acts as a barrier, preventing other players from entering the marketplace.</p><p>Boswell said the bureau is also going to be more vigilant about monitoring the acquisition of small firms by big tech companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201d particularly transactions that could affect competition. Flanked on the forum panel by representatives of competition regulators from the U.S. and the European Union, Boswell said laws have to change to allow competition regulators to be able to quickly obtain evidence located in other countries.</p><p>Sharing information over borders</p><p>\"Because of jurisdictional issues and access to evidence, we need to think about new ways to share information and to share information very quickly across borders, in the public interest in multiple jurisdictions,\" he said. \"We can no longer tolerate a world in which it takes months, if not years, for us to obtain information that is not situated in Canada but that's very relevant to conduct going on in Canada.\"</p><p>Boswell said countries have to work together to deal with the challenges of tech giants and the digital economy.</p><p>\"The rapid rise of the borderless digital economy is a truly global phenomenon, which requires competition authorities to collaborate and cooperate on an almost daily basis. I believe that the best way to look at global conduct that may cause concern is by taking a globally-coordinated approach to enforcement.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca\">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBC-cbcstory1.5156743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7K-YFB1-JCSH-3464-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305992</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><timeReceived>5:07 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Good morning,  ladies.  Thank you so much.  We will see you in a little bit.  Big day  today.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 11th.  Your top stories right now  just before 6:00 a.m. on the EAST COAST.  Stocks are extending gains right  now, we are at the highs of the morning with a big rally underway.  Dow  Industrials set to open up this morning better than a hundred points, the  S&amp;P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 38 points, that's two-thirds of one  percent higher this morning.  </p><p> After a wild day yesterday on Wall Street, markets were volatile, climbing  from the lowest to the end of the day in positive territory.  Big rally  toward the end of the day, taking the market off of the lows.  The Dow had  been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May  delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Then, by the  close, as you can see, markets reversed course.  Up 34 points at the close  on the Dow.  </p><p> Global markets this morning are also seeing a bit of a bounce, take a look  at FT-100 up better than one percent, 69 points higher, CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 71 points, one and a half percent higher, and the DAX Index in  Germany also higher by one and a half percent, that's a hundred and fifty- seven points higher this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets with little  change, as you can see there, very fractional moves and mixed.  Trade talks  are moving forward.  The U.S. and China holding a new round of negotiations  last night.  We have the very latest on where that stands.  </p><p> And coming together, President Trump set to meet with House Minority  Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and funding the border wall among top items on the  agenda, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will go to the White House.   Democrats reportedly ready to offer to $1.3 billion for the wall, but that  is the short of the President's $5 billion request.  Google's turn on the  hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai's headed to Capitol Hill today.  He will  testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  FOX Business will bring you  that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a look at what to expect  from his testimony this morning. </p><p> Then Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit losing its crown as the most  streamed song from the 20th century.  We'll tell you what tune knocked it  off the top spot, all that coming up this morning.  All those stories  coming up.  Joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John Layfield.  It's great to see you  this morning.  </p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BEYOND SPORT GLOBAL AMBASSADOR:   It's great to see you.  Going to be a crazy week.  With the Brexit, its  potential government shutdown, this is going to be nuts. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Nice to see the green though in  the market this morning, really.  Positive reaction to some of this trade  news and especially in Europe, all in the green after yesterday's Brexit. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see how it closes.  The market's volatility has  been just unreal. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  It's a market that's  trading off headlines, that's trading off commentary, from somebody,  anybody, everybody, coming out of the White House, and I think that that's  going to be the case.  Other than the Federal Reserve meeting in the month  of December, that's really the only, like, hardcore piece of news that we  have coming up that we -- that we know about. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We talked yesterday about the fact that the President of  France, Macron, has not been seen in the face of all of these riots.  We  did hear from him yesterday, Dagen.  What did do you think? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He is pledging tax cuts and minimum wage hikes to placate  protesters, but, again, I want to point out that the -- kind of the kickoff  to these yellow-vest protests was a gas tax hike to push his environmental  agenda, and I think that that is an actually -- it's an honest move because  that is what it does take if you want to broadly reduce emissions and push  an environmentalist agenda.  It's -- everybody bears the cost of it.  That  gas tax hike has completely gone away, but the protestors have still been  out four weekends in a row so I -- I'm curious to see if this really does  kind of soothe the unrest. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they say -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- he's out of touch, which is the -- which is the criticism.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  But I need to give Nile Gardiner credit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I used the phrase \"swanning about the globe while (INAUDIBLE)  capital city is burning.  Nile used that phrase over the weekend.  So,  credit to Nile on that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was great when he joined us to -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- navigate all of this.  We got a big show this morning.   Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, Ohio Congressman and  House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan is here.  We're going to talk  with the Congressman about that Google hearing among other things.  Plus  Jim Comey, lots to talk about with Jim Jordan.  Michigan Congressman and  House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Debbie Dingell, is with us this  morning.  Congresswoman Dingell has a lot to say about General Motors.   Plus the Chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg Brown, is with us  this morning.  He's turned that company around.  </p><p> And Former British Parliament Member Euro Pacific Capital Senior Economic  Consultant, John Browne, is here as well.  Plus FOX News Senior Strategic  Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane joins us as well.  Don't  miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.  We kick it off  right here with this top story, and that is all of these swings in the  market.  Checking Futures right now, we're expecting a pretty strong  opening for today's trading.  Dow Industrials right now up a hundred and  twelve points, a half a percent higher after a wild day yesterday when the  Dow slid to session lows down better than 500 points after British Prime  Minister Theresa May announced a delay of the exit vote, Britain leaving  European Union.</p><p> But look at that chart, markets reverse in course, as the session wore on  and as you can see, after the lows hit at about 11:15 a.m. in the morning,  things slowly but surely came back only to end higher. When we were down at  11:15 market better than 500 points.  Market was briefly in correction  territory down 20 percent from the high, that means.  Joining us right now,  CIO, EventShares CIO Ben Phillips.  And Ben, it is good to have you on the  program this morning.  </p><p> BEN PHILLIPS, CIO, EVENTSHARES:  Thanks for having me, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What a market.  How are you doing with all this volatility?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, we've done some things in portfolio raise cash actually on  the Fed pop.  I guess that was a couple of Wednesdays ago.  So, we had a  big day up, markets were up about two percent.  We actually raised cash to  17 percent in portfolio. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.  Big number. </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  So, it was a meaningful move.  You know, I think the  thought was get a little more defensive.  We were pretty skeptical on  anything positive coming out of G20.  And so after we actually saw that  over the weekend, we started to look -- even get a little more defensive. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But longer term, has anything changed in terms of structural,  you know, performance for this market?  Look At the backdrop -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of growth expectations, higher rates, has anything  specifically changed that you really want to shift your allocation and hold  it in cash and just like -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, I think we have to realize that we are late cycle, and  there's going to be more late-cycle activity.  The Fed is pumping the  brakes and what that means is the rate-sensitive sectors are going to see  some of that, you know, giveback and that's what we're seeing.  I think  it's normal to see this type of activity towards the end of the cycle as  the Feds starts its heightening cycle.  So, you know, they said don't fight  the Fed for the past 10 years effectively, don't fight the Feds still, you  know.  They're tightening for a reason, that's going to have implications  on markets.  </p><p> BELL:  One trend that we've seen though on these days, these mornings when  you're up like this by a nice amount -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BELL:  -- we've seen that pop, initial pop, sold into the end of the day  and we end the day -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  -- at the lows, do you expect that today?  When can that trend turn  around? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes, you know, I hear the question.  It's tough to call it a  day-to-day move obviously.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  But I -- you know, I talked to people about a potential rally,  you know, a Santa rally, or even a January rally, which is somewhat  typical.  People are looking to fade, looking to sell into it.  So, I think  that's going to be a trend we're going to see here.  There's been a  rotation that's occurred at the hedge funds where they've derisked.   They've brought down leverage and now we're at a situation where they still  have a little bit more to go, I think.  They're still long tech, they're  still long momentum, so they still have some unwinding of that trade to do.   So, if they're actually thinking the cycle's over, or it's close to the  end, the -- that rotation's going to continue. </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yesterday, we had all talks about Brexit, the week before, it  was all about G20.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  If you take out the geopolitical events and you trade only on  the market, what would the market be doing right now? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, that's tough.  It's tough.  I mean all we do is connect  the geopolitical events -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Right.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  -- to the market.  So, to say what would happen if there weren't  is -- I mean I think the market would be stronger.  I think, you know,  trade -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I guess my question is -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- are we headed for a recession, are we headed for a slowdown?   Would this market still be selling off even into a Christmas rally?  Which  looks to be a great Christmas retail season -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- but people wonder, is this is the last hurrah?  What's your  view?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I think if we remove the geopolitical, we could see a rally  here.  We -- I think we should see a rally here.  Growth -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you're not expecting a growth slowdown?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  No.  What I think is causing it is the confidence crisis right  now.  We've seen China trade actually slowing some supply chains, causing  some drag on growth across the world.  So, that's happening.  Now, if there  is a true pause and we start seeing constructive discussions between U.S.  And China, we could see that actually, you know, reverse course in the  market. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In fact, we have a new round of trade talks that we are  reporting this morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade  Representative Robert Lighthizer, holding a call last night with their  Chinese counterparts, reportedly discussing agricultural purchases, changes  to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the Wall Street  Journal, and this comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei  CFO.  She's still waiting to find out whether she will be released on bail.   The decision could come today.  So, this is all intertwined.  </p><p> We did hear -- as soon as he came back from Argentina, Dagen, that the  President said China was going to buy all these agricultural products,  remember?  $1.3 trillion -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- was the number. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because of the trade fight that we've gotten into with China.   And it's a two-party fight, it's not a one-party fight, and it's really  hurt farmers.  Farmers have gotten multibillion dollar bailout from the  Federal government to help them out.  That will be good news.  But I would  caution that there needs to be one voice, while they -- while the U.S. goes  through these trade talks, there needs to be one voice on this, and I would  say it would be the President of the United States.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think investors have become accustomed to the way the  President communicates.  People can call it what they want, but that's who  he is -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- as Donald Trump, President of the United States.  I think  that this is a moment where a lot of these talking heads in the WHITE HOUSE  need to stay off television.  And I said that yesterday about Peter  Navarro.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, again, there needs to be one voice and clearly there's been  fighting within the White House over time between Lighthizer, and Navarro,  and Mnuchin, and maybe even Larry Kudlow.  So, just let the President talk  about it.  That's it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apparently, they did have this call last night.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did that change opinions in your view on Wall Street in terms  of where we are in this negotiation? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  You know, I think it's positive to see that we're back at the  table.  Since July -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  -- really, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments weren't really  at the table at a senior level.  It was -- it was barely even junior  staffers having conversations.  So, it's positive to see that.  I think we  saw Trump and Xi go back home after the G20.  While there wasn't a joint  communication, they did go back home and they both tried to spend it  domestically.  \"Hey, we got some things done.  There is some progress.\"  We  took that as a positive cue.  If you look at one silver lining from the  G20, I think that's it, that they said \"We have to get something done  here.\"  They're looking at the markets, both of them.  Their respective  domestic markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you do think we're seeing this rally today because of this  new talk last night, right? </p><p> BELL:  Yes, I definitely think that the rally we're seeing -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what's pushing -- </p><p> BELL:  -- this morning is because of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right now.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  We also have another push for tax reform, Ben.  So what about that?   I mean House Ways and Means Committee Chairman -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I don't think that's what's driving markets today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Because Kevin Brady is retooling this tax cuts 2.0 right  now.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's trying to secure more Republican votes, the bill delayed  several healthcare taxes that allows expecting parents to create 529 plans  for their unborn children.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think that has an impact in any way, right? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  No, I think that the plan he released, I think it was the  Wednesday after Thanksgiving or the week after Thanksgiving was more  bipartisan-looking and I think that the revisions are more partisan.  And  so it seems pretty lame ducky some politicking at this point in time.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And speaking of politics, I'll throw this in.  I'm hearing this  more and more from investors.  They're really waiting for the Mueller  report to come out, and they point to the two months before the Ken Starr  report came out in 1998, which was in September of that year, granted that  was the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management at that time as well, so  it's hard to separate the two, but in the two months, between mid-July and  the Starr report coming out in September, the S&amp;P fell almost 20 percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  About -- more than 90 percent.  Granted the market made back all  that loss by the end of November, but this is -- people are standing back  and now waiting as more and more filings come out of the Mueller Team, out  of the U.S. Attorney in the -- for the Southern District of NEW YORK on  Friday, that's becoming a focus as well.  And I -- Gary B. talked about it  over the weekend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's one of three really important things that will  probably give us a sense of what's going to happen in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Number one, who did the Democrats put out there to go against  President Trump?  Number two, how's the economy doing?  We'll see if we are  in a growth slowdown come 2020, and number three, the Mueller report. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What comes out of Mueller?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to add one more thing.  I think the markets -- and I know  you'll agree with me, are -- you're getting a little bit of a lift moving  into the week because we did get an inversion of the yield curve between  the two-year and the 10-year to where, you know, if the shorter rates are  higher, that indicates the recession it has for the last 50 years, we  didn't get that last week, and I think that there was a bit of relief among  investors (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because as it was coming close, the two-year -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- and the 10-year markets were selling off. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  As narrow as it was since 2007, but we didn't get that  inversion and -- </p><p> BELL:  And the reporting on the Fed potentially walking back, maybe taking  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BELL:  -- more of a dovish tone obviously played well into that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Do you buy into that?  Fed's not going to raise as many  as people think right now? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I -- yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ray Dalio, by the way, told us he's not -- they're not going to  be able to do it three times next year.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I don't think so.  I mean, we look at -- if trade continues like  this, that is a drag on growth, and even if it's just discussions, it is  dragging growth, it's dragging confidence, so if we see this continue, I  don't think the Fed's hiking.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ben, it's good to have you on the show.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ben Phillips joining us there.  Coming up,  Macron gives in, the French President pledging tax cuts now, and a minimum  wage increase following weeks of dangerous protests where more than a  billion dollars of damage was done.  Then Google is on the hill today, CEO  Sundar Pichai set to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee on  alleged bias against conservatives.  We're going to cover that live and  we'll talk about it next.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More drama across the pond after the U.K.  Government postponed today's scheduled vote on its plan to leave the  European Union.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So many moving parts to this  story, Maria.  Good morning to you.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now in  Brussels after she postponed today's scheduled vote on Britain's plan to  leave the E.U.  May plans to meet with European leaders in order to signal  concessions on the deal, but the E.U. is already ruling out any further  negotiations.  And May could face a challenge to her leadership for rivals  in the Conservative party.  Well, Lord of the Rings actor, Andy Serkis,  reviving his old Gollum character to poke fun at U.K. Prime Minister  Theresa May and her precious Brexit deal, look. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDRY SERKIS:  They told us, precious, they hates the deal.  All of them  hates it.  They wants a People's vote.  People's vote.\" </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Sorry.  Serkis released the video over the weekend with the title  \"Leaked Footage from Inside Number 10 Downing Street.\"  The video has been  viewed, as you can imagine, more than a million times, it released ahead of  the planned parliamentary vote, which, again, is looking like it's going to  be pretty funny.  All right.  </p><p> Let's move to France.  Embattled President Emmanuel Macron promising to cut  taxes and increase the minimum wage as he addressed the nation last night.   His first public comments following four weeks of violent protests over his  economic agenda.  Macron admitting he is partially responsible for the  demonstrations led the by yellow-vest protestors who took to the streets to  oppose higher fuel taxes now they're government changes and been improving  the economy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator):  And I want to  see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries, and this is why I'm  ordering an end of year bonus for all employees without any tax. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  Last week, Macron suspended a hike in the fuel tax.   Maria, those are your headlines. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of drama coming out.  And I think, Dagen, you made  the point yesterday, \"Well, if you're in Britain, you could look across the  channel and thank God you're not in France right now.\"  What were -- what  were your thoughts of what we heard last night about -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which they think all the time.  I lived in Britain and they  don't really love the French.  They love the food, but not the people who  cook it because they -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I think Europe's falling apart.  I've heard they've already got  the 48 letters signed and that they're really to be delivered at any point.   Nobody wants the Prime Minister role right now, but I think that the Brexit  ends up being probably a hard Brexit, which, if that happens, I think Italy  drops out of the E.U. as well, and the E.U. dissolves. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that -- this is a really important point that you're  making here.  I mean you said Europe is falling apart.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we know what's going on in France, we know the situation in  Britain, then there's Italy.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  That's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the budget issues in Italy.  You're going to have an  election in Germany soon.  I mean -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  And the big issue here is -- with -- I'm sorry to cut you off,  the big issue with Italy is if -- England has to -- U.K. has to stay in.   It will tell Italy they have to stay in as well.  If Italy -- if it sees  that England gets out, they could get out as well, which kills the E.U. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  By the way, there is something cultural going on that has always  been in place that Italy, they -- that they feel like it's important to  preserve their national culture and their national identity, and it's the  same in France, and it's the same in Britain not having a bunch of, quite  frankly, elitist snots in Brussels telling these countries what to do.  And  I think that it's been -- Macron said last night, this is this outrage by  the yellow-vest who's been 40 years in the making, he's trying to take some  responsibility for it.  But when you are one of those elitist snots, then  your people will turn against you.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  At least they're unelected elitist snots.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's the problem, right?  That makes it better somehow?  </p><p> BELL:  This is also all happening when the economy over there is also  slowing down, too, but from lower Levels than we are seeing here, so -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Germany's contracting. </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was some (INAUDIBLE) yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't you think this eventually, you know, impacts the United  States though?  I mean, you know, we're talking about Europe falling apart.   This is a major story.  And it of course is going to impact how we see  growth in the U.S.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, it already has.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Donald J. Trump is evidence of what was going on here  in the United States, the divide between the elitist in our cities, and our  coastal areas -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- and the rural -- and rural America.  People --  their politicians were not listening to people in the Hinterlands. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  All right.  We'll take a short break.   When we come back, there is real frustration at CBS.  Shareholders are  meeting today to talk about the possible legal risks over leaks associated  to the Les Moonves probe.  We've got those details.  And then we're  searching for answers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying today on  Capitol Hill over the search giant's alleged bias against Conservatives.   We'll take you there.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tech is taking the hill.  Google CEO Sundar  Pichai set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee later this  morning.  The Google CEO expected to answer questions on the company's  business practices, including its handling of user data, and potential  political bias.  Joining us right now to talk more about that.  First,  though, here's what House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told me on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FEATURES\" about this hearing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got the CEO of Google coming in to testify, what are you  looking to get out of that? </p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, this is something  you have, too, that we've looked at this for quite some time because  technology affects so much of our life.  Two-thirds of every adult American  gets their news from the internet. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Yes.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  But there -- there's no other company that has a greater control  over the internet on searches than Google, and Google has not been coming  to any of our hearing, whereas Twitter, Facebook, and others.  Ninety  percent of all internet searches goes through Google.  That's not news.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see a regulation?  Are we going to see a bill  come to the floor about bigger power? </p><p> MCCARTHY:  This is why we're having the hearings.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  What do we need to protect?  What do we need to stop the bias,  what do we need for competition. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Managing Director of Equity Research at  Wedbush Securities, Daniel Ives.  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p> DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you comes out of this?  And as an investor, what do we  need to focus on in terms of these technology companies? </p><p> IVES:  Well, because they're investors' regulation, and that continues to  be the sort of big threat for big tech.  You know, I think right here, you  know, Google's really been the last one to go in front of Congress.  So, I  think really in terms of how they navigate the data privacy, but I think  there's also a big focus on China because if you look at China, especially  with everything going on, you know, Google, how they're looking at  potentially getting into China from a search perspective, their view there,  as well as just the overall privacy, and that's really going to be front  and center here.  </p><p> But big techs' watching this, because, you know, this continues to be an  overhang on the space from a regulatory perspective. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Speaking about China, I mean Google decided to work with  China with its in A.I. and yet it said that it didn't want to work with the  Pentagon, it didn't want to be anywhere near the U.S. Government, and yet  tries to have this national score, individual scores for people where  they're watching you at all times, spying on you, and then at the end of  the year, you get a score and that may dictate if you can get on a plane,  get on a train, get a mortgage, I mean it's incredible.  And Google is  obviously enabling that. </p><p> IVES:  Well, because -- and that's why, like, they find themselves in the  crosshairs, because the thing about what's happening in broader with China,  you look at 5G, you look at this battle between U.S. and China across tech.   You're going to see more and more.  U.S. and tech are going to be battling,  you know, specifically on China when it comes to 5G, A.I., and Google is  sort of the center of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  And with regulation, regulation in the U.S. is very different from  China, very different from Europe, where they just passed the GDPR, General  Data Protection Regulation, this year.  How do these companies navigate  those waters?  What kind of expense does that cause and how do they get  from point A to being able to deal with all that? </p><p> IVES:  Yes.  I mean with GDPR, I think that was when there was a big fear  going into that in May.  I think so far, you know, that's when it's been  pretty contained, and that's going to continue to be sort of a unicorn in  terms Of how much regulation you see overseas.  But, look, no doubt, I mean  look from an investor perspective, just given what we're seeing in the  market, the last thing you want to sort of come out of left field today --  and this also has given -- we saw yesterday with Apple getting Qualcomm and  China, you know, so that's the broader backdrop of tech where some of these  things were never factored into valuations.  Now you're seeing it.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  How do you trade Apple?  I've known Apple for years.  Obviously  got a big profit, it's had a great run-up, but right now, it's trading on  geopolitical news.  These, tariffs, as they kick in, could hurt the global  supply chain significantly.  Do you stay away from Apple completely here or  do you find some type of value here at a lower valuation?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And before you answer, let me just say that a Chinese court is  now ordering Apple to stop selling older iPhone models -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- after it found that the company violated two patents held by  Qualcomm. </p><p> IVES:  Yes, that was a major gut punch.  That really came out of left field  because if you go to Qualcomm-Apple situation, it's gone on for a long  time, you look what's happening in China, China is going to be 20, 25  percent of the incremental growth for Apple.  So, if you look at the  tariffs, you will get the situation right.  We continue to believe that  there's value in Apple here where it's trading, but no doubt, I mean if the  90-day period comes and tariffs get up to that 25 percent, and potentially  on iPhones, you know, that really could be a backbreaker for Apple. </p><p> But right here, we continue to be buying that name from a valuation just  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean the stocks now were at their lowest earnings  multiples in years because they've taken such a beating, so what are they  trading in now? </p><p> IVES:  Yes.  I mean if you look right now, I mean look, $15.00 of earnings  for Apple?  OK.  You're talking about so that's now trading, you know, for  (INAUDIBLE) trade 12 to 16 times, trading below that historical range.  So,  you're are starting to get now down to trough levels where you're starting  to bake in some significant bad news into Apple.  OK, every day, the sun  comes up and there's bad news in Apple. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p> IVES:  So I think it's been just a massive string of bad news, if you've  seen the last six weeks, but ultimately a lot it's self-inflicted.  Because  you will get cooked.  Once they away took iPhone metric and transparency  decreased, that set off the storm here and you've continued seeing through  the suppliers. </p><p> LAYFIELD:  So do you not buy the services' idea?  That the service is going  from 10 billion to 50 billion, and Apple's now serves as company.  You  still think it's a hardware company that is dependent upon that sale of the  iPhones for the valuation.  </p><p> IVES:  Look, it's a services-led hardware company and we're talking about  the 50 billion in services -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Correct.  Yes.  </p><p> IVES:  -- in 2020.  That -- from sum of the parts, we believe that's worth  about 400 billion, that's service's business.</p><p> So, right here, you get in a core iPhone business, for 3 to 400 billion,  but, nonetheless, it's a hardware iPhone business in the near term, 60  percent that's where it comes from.  So, right now, that's going to rule  the day which is why right now, the disappointing we've seen with 10Rs  specifically added China, that's really been with the gut punch for Apple.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you still like the stocks?</p><p> IVES:  Look, we -- look, we continue -- we're not waving the white flag on  Apple.  We are buyers of Apple here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about Google?</p><p> IVES:  Look, in our opinion right now, in large cap, we much rather own an  Apple versus some of these other names.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> IVES:  You know, in large cap, just given the valuation and given we know  that there's a cycle there with regulatory risks with (INAUDIBLE) minimum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's Google on the hill today, so we'll see what happens with  the Alphabet parent of Google, Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p> IVES:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Daniel Ives joining us.  Stay with FOX  Business, we're taking you live to Sundar Pichai's testimony, begins at  10:00 a.m. Eastern today, join us and we will roll on that for you.</p><p> First, though, a major meeting today between President Trump and top  Democrat leaders, with border wall funding at the Fore Front, Chuck Schumer  and Nancy Pelosi headed to the White House.</p><p> Then, Nirvana smells like teen spirit, losing its crown as the most  streamed song from 20th century, we'll tell you what tune knocked it off  from the top spot, coming up, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th,  your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Stocks are extending gains this morning.  Take a look at Futures,  indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning.  We are expecting  a big opening with the Dow Industrials up 160 points, that's two-thirds of  one percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ up almost one  percent, 60 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p> There is a run in technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major  comeback yesterday, check this out.  The Dow had been down 507 points, on  the news out of the U.K., and at the close, ended up 34 points.  Fractional  gain but it was a wild one and the market came all the way off of the lows.</p><p> The NASDAQ was up 51 points.  The market was initially hit as British Prime  Minister Theresa May cancelled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  Now, spokesperson for May is reportedly saying that the  government will bring the deal back for a vote by January 21st.  All right,  January 21.</p><p> In Europe this morning, rally there, as well, FT 100 up one and a quarter  percent, 85 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and two-thirds  percent, 78 points higher, DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 163  points higher right now, in Germany.  Small action in Asia, overnight, as  you can see, very fractional moves there, and it was a mixed story.</p><p> A new round of talks is underway.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talked to trade with China's  vice premier on the telephone, last night.  We are watching that.  And I  think that's one of the reasons this market has a firmer tone.</p><p> Then, America's farmers, in the spotlight, Congress is expected to pass a  five-year $867 billion-dollar farm bill, the compromise bill leaving out  (INAUDIBLE) work requirements for food stamps recipients.  We'll have all  the details, there.</p><p> Plus, the Moonves legacy, the CBS board meeting ahead of today's -- an  annual shareholders meeting, we'll tell you what members of the board are  reportedly concerned about on the Les Moonves exit.</p><p> And then, there's this, the Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, has lost  its crown as the most steamed song from the 20th century, the tune that  knocked it out, coming up, right here.</p><p> All those stories coming up, this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is a shutdown showdown, President Trump is  expected to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, today, at the White House.</p><p> They are trying to strike a deal on funding for the border wall.  The  Democratic leaders will reportedly offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall,  that is a stark difference from the $5 billion, the President is  requesting.  The meeting comes ahead of the looming December 21st deadline  to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p> I spoke with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" Sunday.  He weighed in on advice for today's big meeting.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  are going to be meeting with the President on Tuesday, to talk  about the spending bill and the border wall funding.  Why can't the Senate  get on board with the President's border wall funding, sir?</p><p> GRAHAM:  Look at the caravan, look at the charge against the border, look  at the caravans that are to come, look at the holes in our border security,  so here is the problem, you've got the Democratic leader to be in the  House, calling border security, a wall component, immoral.</p><p> If I'm President Trump, Tuesday, I would tell Nancy Pelosi and Chuck  Schumer that we're going to build a wall where it makes sense.  If I were  the President, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding.   I want the whole 5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.</p><p> 1.6 is available to the President, he wants 5, and after the caravan, if  you don't see the need for additional border security, you're just not  paying much attention, so Mr. President, dig in, do not give in when it  comes to the law.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But isn't it the Senate who's stopping this?  I mean, every  time we ask congressman, they say it's passed.  We've got the money in the  House.  It's the Senate.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, you've got to have the speaker of the house who will be in  charge next year, what about next year?  So here's what's happening in the  Senate, we need 60 votes to get 5 billion.  If I were the president, I  would tell the Democrats, I want $5 billion for wall security because for  border security, including a wall, because we need it from the threats  we're facing, this caravan and others to follow.</p><p> And I'd put DACA on the table.  There are 700,000 young people who came  here on the average age of 6, have got no place to go.  They're in the DACA  program, if I were the president, I'd say, I want two years of wall funding  and I'll give legal status to the DACA recipients.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> GRAHAM:  That's good deal for the country.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst,  Retired General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Your reaction -- </p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see  you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to all of this, will the President get the money?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know, because I'm not good at testing the  temperature, you know, the Congress of the United States.  I think,  fundamentally, the wall is necessary.  Take the politics out of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  The border and customs people have been telling us for years, we've  got 600 miles of border security right now, in terms of some kind of  fencing.  And as we have seen in recent television exposures -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  some of that is inadequate, so we've got to fix that.  And then,  we've got to build about 800 more miles of fencing or wall to provide some  degree of security.  And then, there's about -- you know, we've got about  2,500 miles of border, so we're not going to build it in all places, but we  need in certain places, the funnel people in other place where the border  control and customs people can be -- to deal with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  I mean, it is fundamentally a sovereignty issue, Maria.  I think  the President -- the strength of the argument is on his side, given what we  have seen in the last few weeks, with people coming by the thousands, even  though most of them are motivated in terms of economic opportunity, some of  them are motivated because they're passing drugs and they're criminals, but  the overall majority just want a better life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, and we've got that.  But, you know, other people that are  standing in line by the thousands, in front of them, and they've got to get  behind that line, and we've got to get some kind of control.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's an important meeting today, because, you know, the  President has talked about striking deals with the Democrats on  infrastructure, but they've been pretty -- you know, they've been saying,  look, we're not giving you any more money for this wall beyond 1.3 billion.</p><p> It's going to be interesting to see how he can -- it's an early test of his  ability to work with the Democrats on anything.  But let's get to defense  budget, because this is something I know you care about so much, the  President has told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to submit a $750 billion  budget proposal for fiscal 2020.</p><p> I spoke with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday, he weighed in on the  border funding battle, as well as defense spending.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this all about getting the money for the President's border  wall?  Is that what this fight is about?</p><p> MCCARTHY:  We need our borders, stronger, strong and secure, especially  with the caravan and others.  In the House version, we have five billion.   The Senate version has 1.6, and what the President is saying is, I want a  deal.</p><p> That's why Schumer has a process in this, but he's going to have Schumer  come in.  Now, Nancy Pelosi is in a different position.  She's having a  battle to become speaker.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  You have to have 218 votes on the floor, so that's January --  but we have to get this all done in the next two weeks.  You know the type  of new members she has, coming in.  They're much more socialist  progressive.  They don't go to her office to visit her.  They go to her  office to join in the protest, so she has a challenge that she doesn't want  to vote for anything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  She doesn't want anything done.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  She wants to be speaker.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  Exactly.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there you go, General, she doesn't want to vote for  anything, she wants to be speaker.  She's not going to do anything  different to rock the boat on her speakership.  But the defense budget is  basically already funded, but now, what's your take on 2020?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, this is a huge thing that the President has done, because the  Director of OMB, Mulvaney, tasked every single department in our government  to take up five percent haircut cut to include defense -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  which would've stopped the Trump build-up, and what has happened  here is, the chairmans of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee and  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have met with the President and said, Mr.  President, if you do that, then the Trump build-up is going to stop and  we're going to go right back to where we were, before you became president.</p><p> And so, he has decided, we're going to increase the defense budget, which  is, I was on a commission for a year, the Commission on the Defense  National Strategy, looking at this.  And we believe that you need three to  five percent increase, to account for two percent inflation increase, so  you can grow the budget.</p><p> So, that is where we are, and that will be -- that will be argued with the  Democrats who are going to control the House Armed Services Committee.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's even for 2020, right?  The $750 billion -- </p><p> KEANE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  for 2020?  General, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks  so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, shareholders shaken, a  big meeting today at CBS, to talk about potential leaks associated with the  Les Moonves scandal, we are on it, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Five Marines missing after a crash off of Japan.   They've now been declared dead.  Cheryl Casone with details and headlines  now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Those five Marines went missing after a mid- air collision off the coast of Japan, south of Muroto Cape.  There is the  map for you on your screen.  The U.S. Marine Corps has suspended its search  after a refueling plane collided with the F-18 Hornet fighter jet late last  week during regularly scheduled training.  The weapon's system officer in  that jet ejected, he survived; the pilot also ejected but was later  pronounced dead.  </p><p> Well, CBS board members are reportedly concerned about the legal  ramifications of the investigation into Les Moonves' alleged sexual  misconduct.  Wall Street Journal reports they are worried that leaks could  expose the networks to even more legal liability, some are calling for a  probe into the source of these leaks.  Amid all of this, folks, CBS  shareholders are holding annual their annual meeting today; protestors  expected outside to demand the company deny Moonves' $120 million severance  payout.  </p><p> Well, Universal Music Group has released its list of for the most streamed  songs from the pre-streaming era.  You know, the 70s, folks.  And only one  song reigns supreme.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> FREDDIE MERCURY, VOCALIST, QUEEN:  Any way the wind blows doesn't really  matter to me, to me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" the most streamed song from the 20th Century.   It is also seen as spiking popularity, obviously, since the release of the  Freddie Mercury biopic movie that came out last month, which was huge hit,  by the way at the box officer.  Here is the rest of top five: at number  five, \"Take on Me\" by A-ha -- remember that one?  Right?  I love that we're  all 80s kids here.  Guns 'n Roses, has the next two spots with \"November  Rain\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\"  Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has  been played more than 1.5 billion.  And yes, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" despite  being six minutes long, number one, 1.6 billion streams.  I love that we  all get each other in our musical taste. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love all of those songs.  </p><p> CASONE:  Me too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think I'm going to have \"Take on Me\" in my head all day,  though, now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A-ha, of all bands, to make the top five.  And \"November Rain,\"  really, kind of one of the bottom, like, five songs ever recorded by G&amp;R.   What about \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" or (INAUDIBLE), any of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, where was that?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, take a break, when we come back, the finer  things; why more people are investing in their money in fine arts?  That's  straight ahead.  Wait until you see what we've got to show you next up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, as we look at the stock market rallying  this morning, we're also looking at art as an investment as the number of  billionaires and wealthy individuals continues to grow.  More and more are  turn to fine art as a way to invest their money according to the 2017 Night  Frank Luxury Investment Index, art was the most popular luxury investment  ahead of assets like wine, coins and jewelry.  Joining us right now is Fine  Art Curator, Michael Witmer.  Michael, it's good to see you, thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> MICHAEL WITMER, FINE ART CURATOR:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, tell us what's been happening over the last, what, couple  of years in number of the number of billionaires investing their money in  art?  </p><p> WITMER:  We're seeing more billionaires being created than ever before.   We're seeing them being created in far fun places where we haven't seen  billionaires before throughout Asia: China, India, and places like  Malaysia, the Philippines which didn't have many billionaires.  They're  building their own museums, they're pushing up the prices.  We will  continue to see blue chip prices go through the roof because that's what  they want for the walls of their museums.  So, we're seeing the supply go  down and demand go up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What kind of art are they most interested in?  </p><p> WITMER:  They seems to be interested in real museum pieces for --  especially French impressionism, early modern artist like Picasso, Mone,  van Gogh.  We will probably see prices of the good old (INAUDIBLE) start to  go up again.  And once we see those go up, there's no stopping them.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Is it (INAUDIBLE) independent.  (INAUDIBLE) American  billionaires buys different artist, a Da Vinci art or a Picasso for  instance, compared to, say, Asian billionaires?  </p><p> WITMER:  It used to be that way.  But now, we've seen a worldwide increase,  drastic increase in museum attendance, more people are studying art history  than ever before.  If you look 26 years ago with the Louvre, there were 2.5  million visitors and they thought they would never get that high.  Last  year and the year before, it was just barely shy of 10 million visitors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> WITMER:  Most major museums are seeing that.  So, as a result, to answer  your question, we're seeing the museums throughout the world, the  billionaire collectors throughout the world now collecting the same thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love this story.  I want to ask you about this mystery,  though, in the art world.  Last year, we saw the most expensive art sale on  record.  We talked about it on this program a lot, you came on the show to  discuss it.  This was Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi.  It was bought  by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $450 million.  Now,  the master piece has not been seen since its purchase last year.  Scholars  are worried about where it is, where is this painting, where do you think?  </p><p> WITMER:  At $450 million, that painting had its own armed guards and  escorts everywhere it went.  It was probably as safe as President Trump has  ever been.  It's not uncommon in the part of the world for the buyers to  hang something in the living room, enjoy it for a little while, and then  share it with the world.  Also, because they're building beautiful new  Louvre museum that is now opened, it's spectacular.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In Saudi.  </p><p> WITMER:  Yes, and they're building more -- that's in Abu Dhabi, and they're  building more museums throughout that region.  So, they may be looking to  make more acquisitions before they show everything.  The idea that one 450  million-dollar Leonardo is not enough.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amazing story.  Yes, maybe it is in MBS's home?  </p><p> WITMER:  Could be.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael, good to see you.</p><p> WITMER:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We will be right back.  Google is in the  hot seat.  We're going to talk about a CEO Sundar Pichai headed to Capitol  Hill to testify, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 11th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Stocks are rallying this morning, extending gains of yesterday.  Futures  indicating a big market day with the Dow Industrials up 180 points --  that's three-quarters of 1 percent.  S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent, 17  points higher.  And the Nasdaq right now up almost 1 percent, 60 points  higher right now after a wild session yesterday.</p><p> Markets plummeted initially and then climbed from the lows to end the day  in positive territory, up 34 points when all was said and done.  The Dow  had been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa  May delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Her  spokesperson today is saying that the vote will take place before January  21st.  Markets ended stronger and are continuing the rally today.</p><p> Global markets meanwhile are also higher.  FT 100 in London, up one and a  third percent, 92 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up one and three-quarters  percent, 84 points higher.  And the DAX index in Germany up 200 points,  that's almost 2 percent higher in Germany.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets little changed, as you can see fractional moves  across the board.</p><p> Meanwhile trade talks are moving forward.  This is one reason the market  has a firmer tone as well.  The U.S. and China held a new round of  negotiations last night.  We will tell you about the phone call that  happened on that story, coming up.</p><p> And then Google's turn on the hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai is headed  to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  Fox  Business will bring you that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a  look at what to expect from this testimony, coming up.</p><p> On the short list, President Trump among the final candidates on the  magazine's Person of the Year.  We're taking a look at the other names on  the list later this hour.</p><p> And Steph Curry going viral but not for his play on the basketball court.   His comments about the moon landing, landing him in hot water.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  contributor John Layfield.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  I don't know what  Stephen Curry is smoking.  But he thinks the moon landing is fake.  He  could be the greatest shooter of all time.  He's certainly in the top five  but that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He just doesn't believe it?  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  He said, check out Stanley Kubrick who -- there's a big  conspiracy theory that he filmed this for Apollo for nationalism and for  the government.  And apparently he doesn't.  I don't know -- I couldn't  figure out if he was joking or not.</p><p> The Golden State Warriors are saying please, anything but this talk.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I've got some chem trail  theories and flat earth ideas that I can sell him if he's -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Well, Kyrie Irving, the other great NBA (INAUDIBLE) said we do  have a flat earth.  So you have that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm no -- people laugh at the chem trails and the flat earth.   But they're out there.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile President Trump is still looking for his new chief of  staff.  Mark Meadows among the names really coming to the top of the list.</p><p> We've got a market that is rallying this morning. </p><p> Earnings keep beating estimates.  What else are you watching?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What are you watching?  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Well, I think the biggest risk  to the market right now is this trade spat.  So I think the sooner we get  this resolved, the sooner we can resume daily operations of businesses  across the globe, really.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have a phone call last night with Steven Mnuchin and his  counterpart that we're going to talk about coming up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  I was just going to say, I think that -- and I've said  this on the program before when Lindsey was here.  I think business owners,  operators, CEOs, are getting to the point where they're just not going to  make any investment decisions for the next two years, waiting for the next  presidential election.  That's the danger.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And cap spending.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  If it looks like that you have a White House in chaos that  can't get its messaging straight, they can't get any trade deals done  beyond here, you're looking at a really long slog for the next two years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what the Democrats would like.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  We've got a big meeting happening today between the  President and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.</p><p> Coming up this morning, joining the conversation Ohio Congressman and House  Judiciary Committee member Jim Jordan is with us on the day that Sundar  Pichai testifies in front of his committee.  Michigan congresswoman and  House Energy and Commerce committee member Debbie Dingell is here to talk  about General Motors.  Plus the chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions --  he's turned this company around  Greg Brown is joining us.  And former  British parliament member, Euro-Pacific Capital senior economic consultant  John Browne joining us.  As well as the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\", Stuart  Varney weighs in as well.</p><p> Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p> And we kick it off at this hour with this top story.</p><p> It was a wild day on Wall Street yesterday and it's looking good today.   Futures indicating a higher opening to the tune of 200 points at the start  of trading this morning after a volatile session yesterday.</p><p> The major indices closed in the green yesterday but that was really just  part of the story.  They bounced back from early losses which were sparked  by escalating fears over the fate of U.S.-China trade and what happened in  the U.K.</p><p> The Dow slid to session lows about 11:00 a.m. after British Prime Minister  Theresa May announced the delay of the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  But from that point on, it was a climb to positive  territory.  Her spokesperson today this morning says that that vote to  leave the E.U. will take place before January 21st.</p><p> Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment officer, Krishna  Memani.  Krishna -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS:  Pleasure to  be here. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How are you handling all this volatility?  </p><p> MEMANI:  Well, it's not pleasant.  It's not fun.  But at the end of the day  it's part of the markets.  Having said that, I think what we need to focus  on is the underlying economic strength.  The economy continues to do well,  rates are relatively low.  So I think we are still looking for a positive  outcome in the long run.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Would you buy stocks here or do you want to -- </p><p> MEMANI:  Oh, absolutely.  I think cash is a good alternative.  But if you  have a long-term -- if you want to retire, you know, 2 percent, 3 percent  just doesn't get you there.  So you'll have to take risk and earn returns  in the long run and I think equities are still very good value in that  context.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How much of the volatility that you've seen recently is do you  think can be attributed to the reduction, the $50 billion a month reduction  in the Fed's balance sheet, now below $4 trillion.  You had some serious  liquidity and trading problems in the markets last week where people, you  had those exchange traded funds, those bond ETFs where the actual trading  price was below the net asset value which isn't really supposed to happen,  which tells you that the investors didn't really know what the bonds in  those portfolios were worth.</p><p> How much of that is contributing to the overall market swing?  </p><p> MEMANI:  So the balance sheet reduction at the Fed is clearly a factor in  the market, reducing liquidity in the market is an issue.</p><p> I think volatility causes ETF prices to be away from what their net asset  value is all the time.  So I don't read too much into that.  But the Fed,  if it continues to tighten or if it continues down the path of reducing its  balance sheet in a very aggressive way, I think that will have negative  consequences in the market.</p><p> Having said that, we believe the Fed will stop sometime in first half of  2019, because the economy would have slowed down and the inflationary  pressures that they're worried about just won't manifest themselves.  So  maybe one or two times tightening and the Fed stops.</p><p> So if you step back, the two issues driving the market -- the Fed,  tightening by the Fed, and trade.  I think we are on the verge of resolving  the Fed issue.  The trade issue is an open political issue that, you know,  somebody can solve that problem tomorrow -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There was a phone call last night, they're talking about this  being a new round of trade talks taking place last night.  Treasury  Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  held a call with their Chinese counterpart, reportedly discussing  agriculture purchases, changes to China's fundamental economic policies,  according to the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p> It comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei's CFO.  She's  waiting to find out whether she's going to be released on bail.  That  decision could come today.</p><p> So Krishna -- I mean what do the markets expect here in terms of, you know,  looking at these recent developments from the CFO getting arrested to this  Argentina meeting -- what's priced into the market?  </p><p> MEMANI:  I think the market is still expecting trade issues to continue for  a reasonably long period of time.  And I think the driver of that is the  fact that U.S. economic strength gives the Trump administration the  flexibility to continue this path.</p><p> However, by the middle of next year when the U.S. economy is kind of back  to 2 percent, unless the Trump administration wants to take the risk of the  economy slowing down even further, I think they will be forced into a  situation to make some sort of compromise.</p><p> So I think the trade conflict continues for a bit longer but I think even  that will get resolved middle of next year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So is that beginning to get priced into this market, a  slowdown?  Is that what investment participants believe -- 2 percent next  year this time?  </p><p> MEMANI:  Oh, yes.  I think in August and September we were talking about  sustained growth rate, higher inflation.  I think all of that has been  flushed out in the market by October, November.  </p><p> BELL:  Well tech has been a major area under pressure because of all this  trade issues.  But you saw yesterday in the comeback, it was led by Apple,  it was led by the tech sector, and it was led by the semiconductors, up 2  percent, 3 percent across the board.</p><p> And you're seeing that actually this morning, the Nasdaq is leading.   You're seeing some of the semis do well again today.  Do you think that  bodes well?  Can these stocks carry us into the end of the year, maybe give  us that Santa rally?  </p><p> MEMANI:  Well, I think if there is going to be a Santa rally, it will  involve tech in a big way.  There's no doubt about that.  And I think  valuations in tech have improved quite substantially.  They have had a  significant correction.</p><p> I think for the long run, we continue to believe that a trend growth rate  where growth will be around 2 percent, tech companies that have been  delivering significantly better growth rate topline, profitability growth  will lead the rally.  </p><p> It will never be about value.  It will always be about growth and it will  always be about tech companies if this rally continues as we expect.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  On the rally, we have consumer confidence at an 18 year high.   We have unemployment at a 50-year-low.  We have wages that are up.  Looks  like we're going to have a really good Christmas retail season.</p><p> The question is what happens next.  Do you think this is the last big  hurrah before we slide back to 2 percent growth?  </p><p> MEMANI:  I think the economy is already slowing down.  You know, the  consumption part was always robust.  What we needed was capital spending.   That ticked up a little in the first half and subsequent to that, it's been  slowing down. </p><p> I think that's the part that is missing and that is what ails the global  economy.  The desire to invest on business' part is just not there.  Things  like trade issues make it even less so and I think that's why we need to  resolve it.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  You didn't mention Brexit at all.  Brexit yesterday, the market  dipped significantly, came back later because of what might, could or could  not happen.  Does Brexit factor into this in a big way next year?  </p><p> MEMANI:  Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving, you know, unfortunately.   You know, the likelihood that they will get a deal that everyone would like  is basically zero.  So we will have to reach some sort of compromise.  It's  political posturing on all sides.</p><p> But at the end of the day, before middle of next year they have to find a  solution.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The United States has been kind of the stronger of the global  economies broadly speaking.  You've got Germany is now contracting, Japan  contracting.  Can businesses here in the United States up capital spending?   How does the rest of the world impact what happens here at home?</p><p> Does that make sense?  Like, I know we don't operate in a vacuum.  But can  you see an uptick in capital spending if the rest of the world doesn't look  so great?  </p><p> MEMANI:  Well, so I think that's a fair point.  If emerging markets were  accelerating and Europe was accelerating, I think the desire to invest to  support those markets would be higher.</p><p> But U.S. has been the fastest growing market for quite some time.  At least  the relative to trend has been the fastest growing market.  With that, if  the investment didn't come through, the likelihood that it will come  through and the U.S. economy slows down to 2 percent I think is less  likely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bottom line do you want to buy stocks or allocate some money to  fixed income right here?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MEMANI:  No.  I want to buy stocks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p> MEMANI:  I think stocks are good for the long run.  They have cheap  valuation.  The economy is doing quite well and markets are going to go up  over the next two, three years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Krishna -- it's good to see you.</p><p> MEMANI:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Krishna Memani from Oppenheimer there.</p><p> Coming up, Google is on the hot seat today.  Find out what lawmakers want  to know as Google's CEO Sundar Pichai takes to Capitol Hill this morning to  testify in front of the Judiciary Committee.</p><p> Then \"Time's\" Person of the Year -- that person will be revealed this  morning.  Top candidates -- President Trump and Russian President Vladimir  Putin among the ideas.  We'll talk about it.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Congress is getting ready to grill Google's CEO Sundar Pichai today about  the company's data collection, the alleged political bias.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details right now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And a lot more, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And a lot more.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Pichai expected to tackle all of these allegations head on  today.  In his prepared testimony, Pichai is going to say quote, \"I lead  this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products  continue to operate that way.  To do otherwise would go against our core  principles and our business interests.\"</p><p> Now, lawmakers also are expected to question Pichai about Google's plan to  build a censored search engine in China.  Fox Business is going to have  live coverage of the Google CEO.  That hearing, 10:00 a.m. Eastern time  this morning.</p><p> Well Pichai's appearance coming just one day after Google announced it is  shutting down its social network, Google Plus, earlier than anticipated  because of a privacy flaw.  Google says a glitch exposed the personal  information of 52 million users in November.</p><p> This is the second time in two months that Google has disclosed the  existence of a problem that enabled unauthorized access to these Plus  profiles.  The second one, a lot larger than the first, we should add.</p><p> Well, Carlos Ghosn is facing more time in a Japanese jail.  A decision by a  Tokyo court means the former Nissan chairman will remain in custody through  at least December 20th with no option for bail.  Ghosn was indicted  yesterday for allegedly filing false financial reports that understated his  pay by about $44 million.</p><p> Prosecutors also laying out new suspicions that Ghosn underreported $36  million in income between 2016 and this year, underreported.  Ghosn has  denied any wrong-doing in all this, we should say.  Shares of Nissan are  down 14 percent, Maria, so far this year.  But he is staying in jail.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you know he's denying all of this and we still  haven't heard from him.  And they won't allow him to speak to his family.   So he's in this jail cell, sitting -- sleeping on a cot, eating porridge,  I'm told, and told you can't talk to your lawyer, you can't talk to your  family.</p><p> He could be facing 10 years of jail time, Dagen -- and we know what was  going on behind the scenes and underneath all of these, you know,  malfeasance headlines.  And that is, he wanted to merge Nissan with  Renault, the French company.  The Japanese were not happy about it.  They  do not want to be acquired, one of their jewels, the Nissan company, to be  acquired by the weaker, financially weaker French company, Renault.</p><p> And he as the journal reported the other day, he was about to replace the  CEO of Nissan who very conveniently turned on him in three seconds when he  found out that.  So I think there's more to this story.  It's political and  it's really a shame to see this and Japan calls itself capitalists.  What  do you think?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Increasingly it looks like -- I think it's fair to at least  raise the question, was he railroaded? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And by the way, I think it upends confidence in the global  economy when maybe investors realize there is no rule of law in Japan that  if you do business in Japan, you're going to get treated differently than  in a country like the United States of America.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially if you're talking about one of the jewels of Japan,  and that is the automaker, you know.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's an incredible story.  We'll keep watching it.</p><p> Meanwhile there's this, this morning.  Coming up, NBA star Steph Curry in  hot water today over his comments about the moon landing.  Wait until you  see what he said.</p><p> Then, the only list that includes Duchess Meghan Markle and special counsel  Robert Mueller.  We're taking a look at the candidates for \"Time  Magazine's\" Person of the Year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The two most annoying people on earth.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are waiting on \"Time Magazine's\" 2018 Person of the Year.   Who will it be.  We will find out later this morning. </p><p> Until then Lauren Simonetti is here.  She's sharing the potential top 10 --  Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  We've got the short  list.  The list that puts Meghan Markle and Robert Mueller, as you noted,  in the same place and also Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.</p><p> Robert Putin -- well, I went to the Fox party that's why I'm a little foggy  this morning.  </p><p> All right.  Let's give you the \"Time\" Person of the Year short list for  2018. </p><p> You can see, looking at this list, that in the running are -- show me the  list.  Ok, I'll just go on my own. Jamal Khashoggi, he was one -- the Saudi  journalist that was murdered.  He made it.</p><p> Donald Trump, now he took the cover in 2016.  He was the winner right after  he was elected.  But this year, Donald Trump making the short list for his  controversial policies including a policy on separated families.  Families  that were affected by his zero tolerance policy that has ended but still  kids remain not united with their families.  So separated families is an  option.</p><p> Vladimir Putin, of course.  He won a landslide victory for another six  years back in March.  He's on the list for his, you know, the Russian  poisoning of the ex-Russian spy and also tensions with the Ukraine.</p><p> Robert Mueller makes this list.</p><p> The March for Our Lives activists after the school shooting at Stoneman  Douglas in Florida.  They make this list.</p><p> Of course, Meghan Markle, married Prince Harry, now pregnant with child.</p><p> So we'll see in the next hour who is the \"Time\" Person of the Year for  2018.</p><p> Last year, do you guys remember the cover last year, in honor of the #MeToo  movement.  It was the silence breakers.  So you see the popular names such  as Ashley Judd, the actress and Taylor Swift but also, you know, the woman  all the way on the left is a strawberry farmer in Texas.  So women speaking  out against sexual harassment.  That was 2017.</p><p> What do you guys think for 2018?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this cover used to be like the iconic cover that we all  waited and wanted to know about.  I don't know that it has the influence  that it once did.  What do you think?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because it's a pamphlet.  It's not a magazine anymore, number  one.  Number two, here's my prediction.  It's not going to be Meghan  Markle, the most annoying person walking on planet earth.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Why do you think she's the most annoying person?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because she's the most annoying person walking on planet earth.   Can we actually -- she's not the first woman to ever get pregnant, how  about that?  </p><p> BELL:  She did marry a royal.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's such a divided time -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She married a royal.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  If they go with Meghan Markle, I think there will be less to  say about the cover because it won't be as controversial.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why would it be Meghan Markle?  Was she really the Person of  the Year?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Christine Blasey Ford.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No -- Donald Trump.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  She has a chance.  You think Donald Trump again?  So he would  fill two covers in his first term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They probably won't give him two covers.  Yes, you're right.   Maybe it's Vladimir Putin.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It might be the -- I think it might be the people of the March.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BELL:  This is America.  We can't have Vladimir Putin on the cover.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  That doesn't seem right.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LAYFIELD:  The most influential person in the world, though it has to be  President Trump.  It has to be.  Right or wrong, he is the person at the  center of almost everything going around the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what I think too.  </p><p> BELL:  That's what I think too.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Everybody else essentially on this short list because of  President Trump and one of his controversial policies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Here's an idea.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  You know what, maybe it will be Donald Trump again.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Here's an idea.  I don't know if you mentioned.  It's Elon Musk.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  He's not on -- he didn't make the short list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Ok.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Meghan Markle did.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  The \"Black Panther\" director made the short list.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The \"Black Panther\" director -- that would be awesome.  That  would be a great pick.  And it might actually sell some of those \"Time\"  pamphlets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about Lady Gaga?  She's not on the list either.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  She didn't make the list either.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If she wins an academy award, maybe.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Have you guys seen that movie?  \"A Star is Born\".</p><p> BARTIROMO:;  The best movie ever.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.  And now the song is on the radio.  You know what, we  should redo the short list, put Lady Gaga on it and Elon Musk.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll just keep chatting about everything all day.</p><p> Ok.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p> Coming up, aiding General Motors.  Tesla is thinking about purchasing GM's  old plants.  We've got the details on this partnership.  Stock is up 3  percent right now on that.</p><p> And then attacking holiday debt, are you in debt already?  Find out how you  can avoid overspending this holiday season, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th.   Your top stories right now 07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> The bulls are making a run this morning, take a look.  We're at the highs  of the morning right here, Futures indicating a rally at the start of  trading to the tune of 220 points, up one percent on the Dow, up almost one  percent on the S&amp;P and up better than one percent on the NASDAQ, 75 points  higher on the NASDAQ right now.  </p><p> Technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major comeback  yesterday.  Remember when the Dow was down 507 points yesterday?  Yes, it  happened at about 11:15 a.m. only to bounce off of that level and work  their way back to finish the day higher.  Dow Industrials ended the day up  35 points, a fractional percentage move.  S&amp;P was up four and the NASDAQ up  three-quarters of one percent, 51 points higher yesterday.  </p><p> Initially stocks were hit as British Prime Minister Theresa May canceled  the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.  That speech happened  at 11:15.  That's when the markets bounced at the end of her speech.  And  this morning we are hearing that British police, armed British police  reportedly detained a man inside the parliament grounds.  No word yet on  why he was there, why he was detained.  This is a developing story.  We  will bring it to you.  </p><p> Meanwhile, in European trading this morning, we're seeing gains there as  well, FT-100 up 1-1/2 percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany up almost two percent right now, 204 points higher  in Germany.  </p><p> Small action in the Asian markets overnight meanwhile.  Fractional moves as  you can see across the board.  </p><p> A new round of talks meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talks trade with China's Vice- Premier on the phone last night.  We're going to break it down.  This is  being seen as a big positive step in this trade truce.  </p><p> Money for the border, details on today's meeting between President Trump  and top Democrats including Nancy Pelosi.  The Dems reportedly offering  $1.3 billion to fund the border.  </p><p> Then, surviving the holidays, how you can save on your holiday spending and  keep yourself from sinking into debt.  Many people still paying off last  year's holidays.  </p><p> Plus this, NBA star Steph Curry is in hot water this morning over his  comments about the moon landing.  We'll tell you about it coming up.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, General Motors shutdown, the  automaker announcing last month that it will close five North American  plants and lay off 14,000 workers.  But in an interview at \"60 Minutes\",  Elon Musk says buying those plants is a possibility.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LESLEY STAHL, CORRESPONDENT, CBS:  Would you want to buy some of those  plants, those factories, that they're closing down?  You're shaking your  head yes.  </p><p> ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  It's possible that we would be interested.  If they  were going to sell a plant or not use it that we would take it over.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p> REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  Good morning and it's good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  First, give us your sense of the impact of the G.M.  announcement.  I think I saw you quoted the other day that G.M. is now the  least liked company in Washington.  People are really angry about these  layoffs and these cutbacks.  Can you explain?  </p><p> DINGELL:  Well, I will say that people's reaction has been in the  delegation meeting with Michigan delegation that Mary Barra had, it wasn't  me that said that, it was several members on both sides of the aisle that  told her she had managed to unite everybody in their -- you know, dislike  and frustration.  </p><p> Look, this is a serious time.  I've been warning my colleagues here for a  year that this is a cyclical industry and you were going to see a softening  at some point.  But you're also seeing a transformation of the auto  industry.  I had some pretty strong feelings that week, still do, because I  think people were not expecting these announcements the way that they were  handled, upset people, and clearly -- look, I'm a car girl and I'm very  proud of it, it's where I come from.  But I want to keep manufacturing in  this country.  I'm tired of it going overseas.  And a lot of people are  concerned about what we need to do and what this government needs to do to  help keep manufacturing in the U.S.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Dingell, it's Dagen McDowell.  On that note with  the renegotiated NAFTA, it will be up to Congress to pass it.  It is  designed to keep jobs here in the United States, particularly auto jobs.   So on that note, would you -- are you planning to vote in favor of it?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I've not made a decision.  I have talked to Ambassador Lighthizer  multiple times.  I've made it very clear -- you know, we still haven't seen  the details of the bill on Capitol Hill.  He knows how strongly I feel that  I am not going to vote for a bill that keeps letting General Motors move  production.  They announced in July that they were taking the blazer there.   I sent him a tape that I was given by some people, a ground-breaking in  Mexico just last week on a new plant.  </p><p> So I want to make sure and we're going to have to make sure that the  enacting legislation is going to keep jobs here.  There are a number --  there are issues that we have with the bill that we're hearing about it.  I  know that this White House is hoping I will support it.  If I can keep jobs  in the United States of America I'll support it.  I'm not there yet.  </p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Congresswoman, G.M. needed a bailout  because they ran a business very poorly.  It seems to me like they're now  running a business profitably and now the politicians don't like the fact  they're running this profitably.  It seems to me that this is flying  absolutely 100 percent in the face of the free markets, exactly opposite of  what America stands for with you guys interfering in a private business.  </p><p> DINGELL:  So, I don't believe in government interfering with private  business.  And I knew -- I know that there are people out there saying that  we're interfering in their production plants, but we do have a lot of  questions.  </p><p> Know, on the same day that General Motors made that announcement, Ford  Motor Company called me.  I talked to them all of the time.  And by the  way, so does the Japanese government talk to its people, the Chinese  government.  There should be a good relationship so that we are supporting.  </p><p> But Ford took a shift out of a plant that's flat rock, it's where they  produced the mustang.  But they didn't -- you didn't hear about it publicly  for several days.  They talked to every employee that was going to be  impacted by that shift change and they're finding other places for them to  work in the immediate area.  </p><p> So, even the way that they announced it.  They've got to make tough  decisions.  They've got to transform them themselves where I want the  United States to stay at the forefront of transportation mobility.  I don't  want it happening in China or India or Western Europe.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Are you sure you want to quote a Chinese communist government on  how to handle business?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I'm not quoting the Chinese government.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  You just did.  </p><p> DINGELL:  I didn't say that.  I said I don't want it built in China.  I  don't want it built and I said all of those governments support.  You know,  if an American company goes to China, they have to invest with a Chinese  partner there.  Our government needs to support our American companies so  they locate jobs here and we create jobs here in America.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, you sound like President Trump.  Let me ask you -- </p><p> DINGELL:  Well, I have said that I will work with anybody, if I'm going to  help the American worker here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's good, that's what the American people want to hear.  Let  me ask you your thought on trades and tariffs, congresswoman.  What is the  effect of the steel and aluminum tariffs on your home state of Michigan?   We worry and there's a lot of worry that the economy is slowing down as a  result of these higher costs.  </p><p> DINGELL:  You know, one of my problems with the way that President Trump  has done his trade policy is that you're not really sure what it is.   Businesses need consistency and that's one of the things that we don't  have.  We have too much chaos.  Obviously these aluminum steel tariffs are  having an impact.  I've been talking to the companies.  I've been talking  to the supplier industry.  I've been talking to a lot of people, U.S. care  on a regular basis.  And I know that they know that we've got to deal with  this issue.  So, I am concerned about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, do you want the tariffs to go away?  </p><p> DINGELL:  Look, I got to tell you, I have an empty steel plant that sat on  the river of my district for 25 years.  So, I know that we do not have a  level playing field.  I want a level playing field and I want consistency.   I want a stable policy --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the steelworkers are happy about the steel tariffs.  </p><p> DINGELL:  They are very happy about because they've got empty --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, are you happy about the steel tariffs?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I know that it's having an impact.  And I know that there is --  the way that it's being done right now is not having a positive impact on  the businesses that could potentially impact the workers.  I also know that  we've got too many empty steel plants and too many empty plants in this  country because of our lack of a good, strong policy. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's both, you're talking on both sides of the issue.  </p><p> DINGELL:  No, I'm not talking on both sides (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the steelworkers want the steel tariffs.  They feel  they've just got another lease on life because of the steel tariffs.   They're happy about it.  The companies that are paying those tariffs, the  companies that are seeing their input costs are upset about it.  Where do  you sit?  </p><p> DINGELL:  So, if you talk to Ford Motor Company or you talk to some of the  other companies, so same companies that oppose TPP, I might also add, that  the way that this has been implemented has been chaotic.  And if we get a - - it has been chaotic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What ways has it been implemented?  What do you mean?</p><p> DINGELL:  It's been chaotic.  You don't know what the president's plans  are.  You don't know how --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you know what the president's plans are, he's putting  tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  </p><p> DINGELL:  It has not been in a consistent way.  The businesses need  consistency.  But I am going to tell you that I think this government needs  to support American companies the way the Japanese support those companies.  </p><p> And we need to do some things too, like putting some quality standards in  there.  Some of the steel that we've been getting from Japan has not been  at the same quality and we're seeing some damage because of that too.  I  might also add on the side.  </p><p> BELL:  Congresswoman, getting back to NAFTA, the USMCA agreement, the  Commerce Department is out there saying look, the only way they're going to  back it is if the steel and aluminum tariffs are removed from Mexico and  Canada.  Where do you stand on that issue?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I probably -- I'm listening to all of the discussions.  I am  having discussions with people but I think that is something that we need  to take a very serious look at.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So the bottom line, are you going to vote for USMCA?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I don't know.  And I call it NAFTA 2.0 because I want people to  know that the first NAFTA really hurt jobs and screwed the American worker  and I don't want to put a different title on it.  It's NAFTA 2.0. and if  it's going to help the American worker, if it's going to stop jobs going to  Mexico, if I'm going to see another ground-breaking, I'm going to vote for  it.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, will it help or not?  Have you seen it?  I mean,  this --</p><p> DINGELL:  I have not seen the details.  I've had multiple discussions with  many people.  And until we see the details and there are some things in  there that we know are going to take care of it, I'm not committed but I'm  more likely to vote of it than many others.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Are you at least going to read it before you vote on it?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I am somebody who always reads a bill and you can ask my staff.   There's many a night I've stayed up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, good for you, we like that.</p><p> DINGELL:  And you can ask (INAUDIBLE) -- yes, I am -- I don't just do this  willy-nilly.  I want to see jobs stay here.  I know those people.  Those  are people that I have seen and worked with for years.  I know what that  fear and that panic is in that auto worker's heart from what happened in  2018.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I think that's probably why a lot of your constituents  voted for Trump.  </p><p> DINGELL:  It is quite.  And by the way, I'm somebody who two years ago said  that President Trump could win because Democrats did a terrible job of  talking to the worker and letting them know that they cared about.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how is the president doing now, congresswoman?  </p><p> DINGELL:  He's got some -- you know, he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan and  said he wouldn't let an auto plant close.  Well, we just heard that we're  going to see some plant closings, so we've got some issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, you're going to blame him on the G.M. shutdown?  </p><p> DINGELL:  I have said just for the record, I'd work with him.  So I'm  somebody that doesn't take him --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you going to work with him on the border funding?  I mean,  we've got a showdown underway right here.  President Trump is meeting with  your colleague House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.</p><p> DINGELL:  That is correct.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer later today.  They're  trying to strike a deal on border funding.  The Democrat leaders say they  will offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall.  That's a stark difference from  the $5 billion that the president is requesting.  So bottom line here, do  you want the wall or not?  </p><p> DINGELL:  So I wish the world was as crystal clear as you like to see it.   I think the wall is a stupid idea and I think it's a symbol of division  that we don't need.  I do think that we need to keep our borders safe on  both sides.  People forget about the border that I live on.  But if -- I'm  not -- I don't think compromise is a dirty word.  So let's see what  happens.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you said it's a stupid idea.  Then what's your security  net.  If it's -- you said it was a stupid idea.  </p><p> DINGELL:  I think that it's more -- do you want to know what's more  effective?  We need more border crossings, we need to use more electronics.   There are documented studies that say we can keep both borders a lot safer  with a lot more advanced technology.  I think all the wall is a symbol of  division or that people are going to be able to get around anyway.  I do  think we need to invest in keeping our border secure.  </p><p> But let's -- the wall has become the symbol of many things, of division,  that many people say isn't going to work.  But we do have technology and we  need more border agents to help keep our borders safe.  National security  matters.  And I'm tired of people trying to say that people like the  Democrats don't want to keep our nation safe.  Every last one of us, number  one -- number one, keeping our nation safe matters.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So build a wall.  </p><p> DINGELL:  You said -- I have not -- I have said the compromise isn't a  dirty word.  But go read the studies because there are several.  And I'm  glad given to you because I've stayed up at night reading them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p> DINGELL:  Saying that there are ways to keep this nation safer than  building that wall.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, you've got a lot of good ideas.  We hope you  come back soon.  </p><p> DINGELL:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell there.</p><p> Coming up, defense nominating the Seahawks beating the Vikings on \"Monday  Night Football\" last night.  We've got the highlights coming up.  </p><p> And then, one of the NBA's brightest stars with some pretty out-of-this- world thinking, find out what Steph Curry has to say about the moon  landing, that's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A controversial play helps the Seahawks win  again.  Jared Max with all the \"Monday Night Football\" highlights.  Hi,  Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Should  there have been a 15-yard penalty, this is the question that remains.   Fourth quarter, Vikings trail the Seahawks, 6-0.  Seattle's Bobby Wagner,  watch, he uses the shoulders of a teammate to help him leap over the line  of scrimmage to block the field goal.  Should have been a 15-yard penalty  but the Vikings denied.  Few plays later, Seahawks scored touchdown.  And  18 seconds after this happens, strip sack of Kirk Cousins.  Cousins yells  uncle, Vikings lose 21-7.  Seattle won four straight, Russell Wilson a  career low, 72 passing yards.  </p><p> All right, the next time Golden State Warrior star Steph Curry meets with  reporters, the pressing questions likely won't be about what Steph did last  night on the court but rather something he said in a podcast.  Steph scored  38 last night, seven of 14 from three point range.  The Warriors win by  eight against Minnesota.  What will Steph Curry get asked about?  This  comment, made on the podcast, winging it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEPHEN CURRY, NBA BASKETBALL PLAYER, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS:  We ever been  to the moon?  </p><p> UNIDENTFIED MALE:  No.  </p><p> CURRY:  They're going to come get us.  I don't think so either.  Sorry, I  don't want to start conspiracies.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  Have you ever been to the moon?  Steph, NASA says we would love for  Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston.  We  have hundreds of pounds of moon rock stored there.  He can see that  firsthand what we did 50 years ago.  Maria, Steph Curry says we didn't land  on the moon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say about that.  I mean -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  You could see footprints on the moon from the astronauts with a  telescope.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, thank you, Jared.  We want to get to this tweet that the  president just posted.  President Trump is just tweeting on the border  wall.  Here's what the president just said.  Despite the large caravans  that were forming and heading to our country, people have not been able to  get through our newly built walls, make shift walls and fences or border  patrol officers and military.  They are now staying in Mexico or going back  to their original countries.  ICE, border patrol and our military have done  a fantastic job of securing our southern border, writes the president.  </p><p> The president says a great wall would be however a far easier and less  expensive solution.  We have already built large new sections and fully  renovated others making them like new.  The Democrats, however, for  strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left,  do not want border security.  They want open borders for anyone to come in.   This brings large scale crime and disease.  Our southern border is now  secure and will remain that way.  </p><p> The president writes I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer and  Nancy Pelosi.  In 2006, Democrats voted for a wall and they were right to  do so.  Today, they no longer want border security.  They will fight it at  all cost and Nancy must get votes for speaker.  But the wall will get  built.  </p><p> The president goes on to say, people do not yet realize how much of the  wall including really effective renovation has already been built.  If the  Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will  bring the remaining sections of the wall.  They know how important it is,  says the president.  That was a long tweet.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it is the most wonderful time of the year but also the  most expensive.  15 percent of Americans are still paying off last year's  holiday debt which averaged $1,054.  Joining us right now is Ramsey  Solutions financial expert and author of the upcoming book, Everyday  Millionaires, Chris Hogan.  Chris, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY'S SOLUTION:  Well, thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, we all want to buy presents this holiday.  What are some of  the ways we can save and not get too far into debt, Chris?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Yes, Maria, the most important thing is to remain in control.  You  know, you don't want to let the holidays make you crazy.  So stay in  control.  </p><p> So, I've got four tips for people.  Number one, tally up what you've spent  so far.  A lot of people have been shopping throughout the year for  Christmas.  So be aware of what you've already bought, what you've already  spent.  I really want you to stay focused and stick to your budget.  This  is where you assign a dollar amount of how much you're going to spend and  who you're going to afford to shop for.  </p><p> The next tip is use cash.  Cash will help you remain in control.  And it  helps you to understand your limits.  If you're going to spend $100 on your  brother for Christmas, when that $100 is gone, you stop.  </p><p> The next tip is avoid the store credit cards.  These things are sneaky,  Maria, and they're a thief.  I mean,  it's amazing that they'll offer you  10 percent off that day, but charge you 24 percent every other day.  So  avoid that.  </p><p> And then finally, 22 percent of Americans buy gifts for themselves when  they're shopping for others.  So don't buy for yourself every time you go  out shopping.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I can't not do that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I always buy myself a gift.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris, with your perfect voice, it's Dagen, I just want you to  sing the following line, you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  Because you're  Grinching on the holiday, Chris.  I want to buy myself some socks.</p><p> HOGAN:  No, Dagen, I am not doing that.  No, I'm not singing.  But here's  the thing.  Credit card debt -- Credit card debt is a Grinch.  Credit card  debt is the thing that will steal your joy and it will cause you to be --  you know, trying to pay off Christmas for two to three holidays from now.   So just take a deep breath and understand the real reason for the season.   It's about family.  It's about friends.  It's not about how much you spend.   It's not how much you buy for yourself.  So let's go into this holiday with  clarity.  Be aware, remain in control, and don't bring debt into your life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, and you can't blame us for trying.  You have an  incredible voice, Chris.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, maybe the next time I'm in studio I'll sing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can't get enough of your love, babe.  Chris, thank you, Chris  Hogan.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you so much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, Google on the hot seat, Sundar Pichai going before  Congress later this morning.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Tuesday, December 11th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the East Coast on the bottom.  Stocks extended the gains this morning.   Check out this rally underway.  Dow Industrials expected to be up 200 plus  this morning at the open.  That's one percent higheAppr.</p><p> The S&amp;P 500 is up almost one percent, 22 points higher.  And the NASDAQ up  1.1 percent, that's 76 points higher right now as we speak after a wild  session yesterday.  Markets bounce off of the low and actually ended the  day in positive territory, but man was it hard getting there.  The Dow  Industrials when all was set and done was up 34 points, fractional gains  percentage wise.</p><p>S&amp;P was up four points and the NASDAQ was up 51 points yesterday.  Three- quarters of a percent higher.  But it had been down sharply.  In fact, the  Dow was down better than 500 points at its low after British Prime Minister  Theresa May announced that she was delaying the vote on the deal to exit  the European Union.  Then, markets started clawing their way back up.  Her  spokesperson this morning tells Fox Business that the vote will take place  before January 21st.</p><p> Global markets this morning are also higher.  Take a look at European  indices, FT-100 up 106 points, 1-1/2 percent higher.  The CAC quarante in  Paris is up almost two percent right now.  92 points higher.  And the DAX  Index also up almost two percent, 202 points higher in Germany.  In Asia  overnight, markets were little changed as you can see there.  Meanwhile,  one reason for the bounce this morning, trade talks are moving forward with  China.</p><p> The U.S. and China held a new round of negotiations last night on the  phone.  We will have the very latest on what went on.  Coming together  meanwhile, President Trump is set to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy  Pelosi and the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over the funding for  the border wall.  That is among the top items on the agenda, Democrats  reportedly ready to offer $1.3 billion for the wall.  That, of course, is  short of the President's $5 billion requests.</p><p> Plus this, Google's turn on the hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai is  headed to Capitol Hill this morning.  He will testify before the House  Judiciary Committee.  Fox Business will bring you that live, 10:00 a.m.  Eastern.  We're taking a look at what to expect from his testimony when I  speak with Congressman Jim Jordan, he's on Judiciary.  He's coming up.</p><p> And then Delta says no to kittens and puppies.  Really?  The details on the  new emotional support rules at Delta Airlines.  Oh, look how cute that is.   All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  Contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happily surprised that European  markets are up after all the Brexit talks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Big rally underway.  Maybe initially the markets  turned when she said she was delaying the vote but then by the end of her  speech the markets started rallying.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I think the market is a thing that she could get a no-confidence  vote and he could have a new referendum and that would be the -- probably  the best thing for the market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And a new prime minister.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.  Definitely.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  You know --</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Hopefully it's not Jeremy Corbyn.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Could Be Boris Johnson.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  He got a new haircut.  He did.  He even got (INAUDIBLE) on the  morning thug shows and the rumor is he got that the new look to try to  become the new prime minister.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I think it just goes  to show that the cracks that are in the European Union, we likely discussed  at the top of the show, you know, you've got these guys, we got France  going on there, you've got Italy, there is a lot of question marks on the  distance --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BELL:  -- going forward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's trade and the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve seems  to have -- taken us a step to the side in terms of market worries and now  trade as talks get under way.  The messaging here is critical out of the  White House.  We'll see how they do that in the next 90 days,</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We got a lot coming up this morning.  Joining the  conversation, House Judiciary Committee member and Ohio Congressman Jim  Jordan is with us this morning along with Motorola Solutions chairman and  CEO Greg Brown who has totally turn that company around.  Former member of  British parliament John Brown is here and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big  hour coming up.</p><p> And we kick it off right here with this top story and that is the shutdown  showdown.  President Trump is gearing up for a meeting today with  Democratic Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.  This is an effort to  strike a deal on border funding ahead of the looming government shutdown.  Blake Burman is live right now at the White House with the very latest.   Blake, good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you.  Here we go again.  President Trump wants $5 billion more for his  border wall.  Democrats aren't willing to get anywhere near that number and  there's got to be some sort of a compromise by December 21st or else there  will be a partial government shutdown and that include the Department of  Homeland Security.</p><p> We will get a much better idea later today as to where things stand as  President Trump is set to meet this morning with Chuck Schumer and Nancy  Pelosi 11:30 here at the White House.  And a series of tweets this morning  the President continue to vouch for the wall and even floated a new idea at  one-point writing \"I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer and  Nancy Pelosi\".</p><p> In 2006, Democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so.  He then  went on to propose the following \"if the Democrats do not give us the votes  to secure our country, the military will rebuild the remaining sections of  the wall, they know how important it is.  That was just snippets of five  different tweets that he sent out.  In a joint statement ahead of this  meeting, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi put the onus on Republicans to make  sure that there is not a government shutdown.</p><p> Saying in their statement \"our country cannot afford a Trump shut  especially at the time of economic uncertainty, this holiday season the  President knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to  pass the House and Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan  agreement.  Maria threats about a government shutdown, nothing new in  Washington with that and certainly nothing new in the Trump presidency with  that.</p><p> The different dynamics this time around is that Democrats take control of  the House in about three to four weeks' time, meaning that the moment could  be now for the President to get as much as he can on the border wall.   Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All-important points you make.  Blake, thank you.  Blake  Burman joining us there at the White House.  Joining me right now is Ohio  Congressman House Judiciary Committee member and Freedom Caucus member Jim  Jordan.  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much  for joining me.</p><p> REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  Good to be with you.  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You and Congressman Mark Meadows published an op-ed for Fox  News this morning titled, Build the Wall -- do what we said we'd do, and it  reads in part, Democrats do not want to bring attention to their extremist  positions on immigration.  Therefore, open borders and abolishing  immigration and customs enforcement, securing the border is not going to  happen in a Pelosi-run Congress.</p><p> We still have three weeks, that's more than enough time to do what we said.   And my question, Congressman is, can the President get this funding with  Republicans?  Because it is not just the Democrats who are pushing back on  this, the Republicans refuse to get behind the President's request and this  has been going on for a year, Congressman.  </p><p> JORDAN:  Yes.  No.  There are Republicans votes for this.  The problem is  Chuck Schumer in the Senate and the 60-vote rule they have over there which  is ridiculous, so there are Republican votes to build the border security  wall and deal with the asylum law changes that we have to have to address  the caravan issue.  That's the position the Freedom Caucus has taken, more  importantly, that's the position of the American people.</p><p> And frankly what we were elected to do in 2016.  So this is common sense,  five billion for the wall, change the asylum law so we can deal with this  caravan issue, this catch and release issue.  Let's do those things there,  good common sense.  Let's get them done.  The problem is Chuck Schumer and  he talks a lot about a shutdown, Maria.  Remember, there's been one  shutdown this year and guess who did it, Chuck Schumer on a short-term  spending bill back in February when he shut the government down over the  weekend and he said, amnesty was more important than funding the troops and  funding the government.</p><p> So if you're going to talk about shutdown, the only one who's done that  thus far is Chuck Schumer.  So let's just do what we said and get the thing  done.  That's where the American people are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree.  No, you're right about that.  So what happens today  when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say to the President, look, all we have  is $1.3 billion and that's it.  And we don't want DACA attached to this, we  don't want anything else -- I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi is trying to get her  speaker votes in order, right?  And that's not happening until January.   So, why is she going to vote -- why is she going to do anything?  She  doesn't want to rock the boat before she gets the speakership, right?  </p><p> JORDAN:  Yes.  I think we just -- again, just do what we said put the five  billion on the must-pass spending bill, put the asylum reform language on  there and go have the debate with the American people and say if Chuck  Schumer doesn't want to support this, if he really wants a shutdown, if the  Democrats really don't want to do these common sense things, that's on  them, let's -- after all, excuse me, after all they're the only ones who  shut the government down.</p><p> I think you just got to have the debate and frankly not be afraid of having  the debate.  Let's actually have it, let's say, here are the two positions,  American people you decide.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you think the Republicans will be there?  </p><p> JORDAN:  I do, and I hope so.  I think I know the President is there, I  know the Freedom Caucus is there, I hope we'll stand firm on that position.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, the Freedom Caucus is calling for two amendments to the  funding bill including funding for the border wall and ending catch and  release policies.  Tell us about this because most people don't understand  when an illegal comes here and the U.S. catches them, they have to release  them and then get a court date in the calendar and they may or may not show  up.  So, then they're in the country illegally, probably taking others'  jobs, creating a lot of expense for the U.S. </p><p> JORDAN:  Yes.  And it's even worse than that.  DHS and ICE will tell you  that 85 percent of the individuals who show up at the border and actually  claim asylum, 85 percent of them aren't legitimate asylum seekers.  So  that's why we need more judges on the border, we need to deal with this  right away, not let them come to the country, get in the country, release  them and then they never show up for their hearing.</p><p> So let's have the hearing right away.  In fact, the President is working on  this.  He's working on making sure they stay in Mexico before they come in  the country and you can actually adjudicate and figure out everything then,  have the hearing then before they come in.  If they're legitimate, they're  running and fleeing something, that serious then understand and so we want  to let them in the country but we want to be able to vet them, check them  out.</p><p> Again, that is just good common sense.  And it's so contrary to where the  Democrats are.  Remember in 2016, the leader of their party said she wanted  a borderless hemisphere.  They're the ones who said they want to abolish  ICE.  So those are the two choices it seems to us our position is pretty  darn common sense, let's do the common-sense thing and let's stand firm for  it.  Actually, I think our voters appreciate that the American people  appreciate that when you stand firm and do the right thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I agree with that.  I got to get to Google but first, your  take on the Jim Comey testimony where he said, I don't know, I don't  remember I don't recall 245 times.  What are you going to get done in your  new Congress number one because now you've got a different position in the  new Congress and what happens when the Democrats shut this all down which  you know that's coming?</p><p> JORDAN:  Yes.  It will be harder obviously in the new Congress but we still  have this Congress.  We need Rod Rosenstein to come in and testify.  It's  now been 12 weeks since he talked to subordinates about wearing a wire to  record the President and talking about invoking the 25th amendment.  So we  need --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- you know that's not going to a happen.  Look, Paul Ryan had  a shot and he let it go, OK?  </p><p> JORDAN:  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> JORDAN:  I think it might still happen because Mark Meadows -- Matt Gaetz  and I are continuing to push for that.  So I think there's a chance that it  does happen and frankly, it should happen and we need him to come in and  answer those questions.  As far as Jim Comey goes, he didn't know the first  thing about Christopher Steele.  The guy whose work product was the basis  for getting the FISA to spy on the Trump campaign.  So he didn't -- he  never knew Chris Steele, never talked to him.  Didn't know he was working  with Bruce Ohr, the top Justice Department official.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.</p><p> JORDAN:  Didn't know that Bruce Ohr was hacking information to the FBI.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there ever going to be any accountability here, Congressman?   Any accountability for those who try to put their finger on the scale in  the 2061 election.  We all know what went on.  </p><p> JORDAN:  We're pushing for it but I will say -- tell you this, Comey has  been fired, Deputy Director Andy McCabe fired, Jim Baker chief counsel of  the FBI was demoted, then last, Lisa Page, FBI counsel demoted then left  and Peter Strzok, deputy head of counterintelligence was demoted then  fired.  So these are the top people.  I've never seen that happened before.   Andy McCabe maybe facing some criminal liability as well.</p><p> So we'll see how this shakes out.  We can't put anyone in -- we can't  prosecute anyone, we can only get the answers for the American people and  that's what we're trying to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's a good point that you make because without the  Republicans and you and your colleagues pushing all of this, Devin Nunes as  well in the House, we would not know any of this.  All right.  Real quick,  Google on the hot seat, CEO Sundar Pichai set to appear before your  committee later this morning.  He's expected to answer questions on the  company's business practices, handling of user data, potential political  bias.  What are you expecting, what do you want to hear?</p><p> JORDAN:  Well, a couple things.  Remember 3.5 billion searches a day.  And  if a company like Google is biased and limiting certain points of view,  that's a big problem.  So that's the issue, that's the fundamental issue  that we need to explore and find out.  Are they really limiting point of  views?  It seems that they are, it seems like it typically is conservative  points of view.  So that's sort of the focus.  When you have a company with  this clout, this much influence, this much power over the flow of  information and potentially then the impact that can have on the electoral  process, that's pretty darn serious and that's going to be the focus of the  hearing.</p><p> Is there bias there?  It sure looks like it, let's explore that.  And if  you're not willing to change things, and actually be a neutral platform  like you portray yourself to be, then the Congress may have to take some  action.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you said what?  3.5 billion searches a day?  Is that  what you said?</p><p> JORDAN:  3.5 billion searches a day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know Google has 90 percent mortgage here.  Real quick before  you go, Congressman.  Do you want to see regulation -- new regulation on  these companies, these social media companies?  Who are media companies?</p><p> JORDAN:  I think it depends on what to learn but what we want is neutrality  that the law gives them all kinds of protections if there are neutral  social media platform if there are a neutral platform.  If they're not,  then you may have to treat them like a publisher, you may have to treat  them like a newspaper.  And frankly you may have to also look at, do we  have to break these companies -- these companies up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  All right.  We're going to be watching that.   Congressman, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p> JORDAN:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jim Jordan there.  Stay with us for FBN live coverage of Google  CEO testimony before Congress at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We're going to take  you there live.  But first, new negotiations.  Details as American and  Chinese officials kick off a fresh round of talks last night.  Stay with  us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tesla announcing plans to open nearly a dozen  new dealerships in U.S. next year.  Cheryl Casone, with details there.   Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, change of  direction here, Maria.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, tweeted out this morning,  \"We're opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including  Knoxville.  Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.\"</p><p>Tesla moving to expand its retail presence by focusing on locations inside  malls where shoppers can, of course, check out its cars in person.  Musk,  who was born in South Africa, adding Tesla could open its first store in  South Africa by the end of 2019.</p><p> Shares of Tesla higher ahead of the opening bell up more than 1-1/2 percent  right now.  Excuse me.</p><p> Well, Delta has making changes to its animal policy.  The airline banning  all emotional support animals, on flights that are longer than eight hours.   It's also prohibiting all animals under four months old -- think puppies,  kittens, no matter how long flight.  The policy goes in effect on December  18th.</p><p>Delta, says the changes were made because of a big increase in incidents  involving animals.  Take a look at the stock, Delta is up slightly, ear-to- take.</p><p> OK, the Trump administration wants to deliver much-needed revenue to the  Postal Service.  It's proposing selling access to your mailbox to private  companies.  It is illegal for anyone except the Postal Service mail carrier  to deliver to a mailbox that makes the mailboxes as highly valuable assets.</p><p> Well, the new report says the Postal Service could generate significant  revenue by selling mailbox access to companies like FedEx, UPS, et cetera.   Postal Service recently reported a net loss of $3.9 billion in the fiscal  year that ended in September.</p><p> And Post Malone and Crocs are teaming up again on a new shoe.  This is big.   You are looking at the Post Malone X Crocs Barbed Wire Clog.  Which goes on  sale today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time for about 60 bucks.  The barbed wire  design mimics the tattoo of it's on Post Malone's forehead.</p><p> The first collaboration between Crocs and the rapper sold out in less than  a day.  When that shoe they be, that was just last month.  Taking a look at  shares, of Crocs, they had nearly doubled so far this year.</p><p> Maybe somebody has something to say about Delta on the panel, but -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I fear headlines.</p><p> CASONE:  We all do.  We all do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, yes.  I just -- I can.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's wrong puppies and kittens?  What?  Excuse me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Puppies and kittens are problem, but not the 300-pound sweaty  guys sitting next to me with shoes off, who can't get even put the armrest  down.  Whose chewing gum and eating Cheetos at the same time.  And then,  rubbing the Cheeto residue all over the edge of my seat.  He's fine.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Puppies and kittens.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But puppies and kittens really stink.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's ridiculous.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what it's about?  It's about money because when you put  bringing animals on a plane and put them under the seat, in a carrier, they  charge you.  I think its $250 round-trip for a puppy or kitten or any small  dog.  That's why it is about revenue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, I'd like some answers from Delta.  What's wrong  with puppies and kittens?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  This is a horrible decision.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Terrible.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Horrible.  I won't give my cat a fake I.D. to get only kids,  take him under 4-months old.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, if you can put -- you can put him in a crate.  You can put  him in a crate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Puppies and kittens.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can put them in a crate.  You just can't put them in your  lap.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But a sweaty guy with the shoes off, he's OK.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, why would I want barbed wire on my shoes?  I  mean, I'm saying -- all right, quick break.  A new round of trade talks  occurred last night.  The details as the U.S. and Chinese officials discuss  changes to Beijing's economic policies.  Wait until you hear this.</p><p> Stay with us for an exclusive c-suite reaction from Motorola Solutions  chairman and CEO Greg Brown.  That's next.  And then, the best places to  work.  We'll tell you the company that took the top spot.  Coming up.  Stay  with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  China trade negotiations.  The U.S. and China  kicked off a new round of trade talks last night.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and their  Chinese counterparts talked on the phone.  President Trump just tweeted  about the talks moments ago.  He says this, \"Very productive conversations  going on with China.  Watch for some important announcements.\"</p><p> Joining me right now is a gentleman whose company operated in China for a  long time.  Fox Business exclusive right now.  Motorola Solutions chairman  and CEO Greg Brown.  And Greg, it's great to see this morning.</p><p> GREG BROWN, CHAIRMAN, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And you know it's  interesting because Motorola was one of the first companies in Europe in  China.</p><p> BROWN:  We were.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've got a real story here.  Nixon was on a Motorola  phone.  You had a Huawei executive arrested years ago.  So, I want you to  take us back to how Motorola has operated in China, and what your history  is with China, sure.</p><p> BROWN:  It so, as you mentioned, President Nixon in 1972 when he first  visited the country spoke on a Motorola provided satellite phone.   Subsequently, Bob Galvin led a delegation in 1986.  And the following year,  Motorola was one of the very first U.S. multinationals in the country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, then, what happened?</p><p> BROWN:  Things boomed, it was great.  China ascended into the WTO.  If you  think about the Motorola firsts in China, Motorola built the largest at the  time, contiguous cellular network in China.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BROWN:  It offered the first mobile phone with Chinese characters.  It had  the first Chinese mobile phone with GPS.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did you have to transfer all your technology over to the  Chinese?</p><p> BROWN:  Not at that point.  Not at that point.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, then, what happened?</p><p> BROWN:  So, then things progressed, and I think the whole environment  changed -- started to change about a decade ago.  It's well publicized in  2007, a Huawei actually was a Motorola engineer who was arrested at O'Hare  Airport with a one-way ticket to China.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BROWN:  $30,000 in cash, a thousand thumb drives.  And what we found was  Huawei was stealing trade secret and confidential files from Motorola with  Chinese nationals that were our employees.  That was subsequently settled.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you know for a fact that China was using Huawei as a tool  to steal secrets from Motorola.</p><p> BROWN:  Huawei definitely stole trade secrets from Huawei.  And we sued,  Maria, but we subsequently settled.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, continue.</p><p> BROWN:  So, then you fast forward to now and I think it's a very different  environment.  Market access is tough.  If you want to compete in China, you  have to usually -- if not oftentimes turn over your intellectual property  to a local alliance, they use indigenous standards for cellular as  something called TD-SCDMA.  In our world for Motorola for policing, it's  called police digital trucking.</p><p> So, quite frankly, we made the decision, I made the decision about eight  years ago to essentially get out of China.  In the sense of no  manufacturing, no R&amp;D, I think it's a good market to serve.  It's OK.  It's  vast.  We'll do so on terms that conducive -- that are conducive to us.</p><p> But lastly, just a couple of statistics.  At the height of Motorola in  China about 15 years ago, we were over $3 billion in revenue and 15,000  people.  Today, we're a $170 million of revenue with 170,000 people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BROWN:  So, it's a different game.  We're competing.  We're moving forward  with a mission, critical communications.  Video surveillance, and  analytics.  And we want to be and we are the Western alternative to non- Chinese electronic content.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p> BROWN:  Here we are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And here we are, where you got into this company and completely  lifted the growth.  I mean, you're just coming off of a sixth-quarter of  impressive results.  This formidable niche that you have been able to  create in this space.  Tell me how is it going?  You've also acquired seven  companies spent $3 billion on those deals since 2015.</p><p> Mostly new software programs.  Where does the growth come from now at the  company and what led this growth over your tenure?</p><p> BROWN:  Well, I think we pivoted more toward a services and software  orientation, number one.  Number two, we have I think the best employees in  the industry.  Strongest team I've ever had.  We've taken advantage of some  of the corporate tax reform and use that capital for aggressive  acquisitions.</p><p> But here's the interesting thing with us.  We're not just the radio  communications provider anymore.  We do the mission-critical communications  that are so vital to secure communities, secure the border, protect the  military.</p><p> We're also the leader in integrated command center software.  So, you think  about all these dispatchers in America at 6,000 locations.  Taking calls on  a headsets for 911 call handling.  CAD dispatch of first responders,  evidence management, and then, you think of the proliferation of video.</p><p> And we spend a billion dollars on a leading provider of video surveillance  and analytics.  Here is the cool part.  It's not just the camera.  It's an  intelligent edge device with video storage, with video management, with  machine learning video analytics.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BROWN:  So, now we are comprehensive mission-critical communication and  video surveillance company, and we are booming.  We've had eight  consecutive quarters of organic growth, record backlog, the U.S. economy is  the anchor tenant that's driving growth.  And I think we're very well- positioned going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it apparently.  And you've got this great backlog in  terms of driving growth in the next five years.</p><p> BROWN:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you about the consumer today.  I mean, and  business spending.</p><p> BROWN:  Sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were having a debate earlier in terms of business spending.   And are we seeing capital expenditures stay up there?  What's your view of  the economy right now, and are you expecting things to slow down in the  coming couple of years?</p><p> BROWN:  We're not expecting it to slow down as we think about 2019.  Two- thirds of Motorola's revenue are North America, we are increasing hiring,  we are increasing capital spending because we see the growths opportunities  live more at the capital allocation and deployment.  I think that growth  internationally in the other theatres might be more be a little bit more  tempered, maybe in '19.  FX headwinds maybe a little bit greater.  But at  the end of the day, given what we do, which is mission critical public  safety, it's a need to have, not a nice to have, so I think we have some  indifference to some of those international markets that we can weather  through.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are just getting the Producer Price Index out, the PPI is up  one-tenth of a percent for the month of November.  We were expecting it to  be unchanged.  This idea that input costs are going up for business.  What  are you seeing?</p><p> BROWN:  I see very modestly and manageably.  So, I think if we take input  costs and overlay, our conversation with China and the tariffs, we expect  tariffs increases in 2019 to be about 8 to 10 million.  So, we can moderate  it, it's incorporated into the business plan.  I think the input costs can  be managed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're not worried about steel and aluminum tariffs cutting  into this strength that you have?</p><p> BROWN:  No, I'm not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, the way you have turned this company around and  led -- you gave those stats at the beginning of the -- of the interview in  terms of revenue today, number of employees today.  Where do you go from  here?  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p> BROWN:  Well, we are in a huge addressable market.  So, if you think about  video surveillance and analytics, we're 4 to 500 million revenue a year in  a $12-billion market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big runway.</p><p> BROWN:  Huge runway.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big runway.</p><p> BROWN:  Our software revenue is about 400 million, in a command center  software addressable market of 5 billion plus.  So, the market is there,  our brand and domain expertise is there.  I think we have all the tools and  capacity to continue to drive growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the chart looks good, the stock is obviously trading up,  has been for the entire last couple of years.  In terms of shareholder- friendly moves, what are you planning in terms of stock buybacks, dividend  increases, et cetera?</p><p> BROWN:  Well, I think we've been very disciplined in capital allocation if  you think about it.  So, historically, in last several years might of my  tenure, we deployed 12-1/2 billion of share buyback at a price of 58 and  change.  We've now spent more contemporarily --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  58 and change.</p><p> BROWN:  -- 3 billion on acquisitions.  So, we're investing organically, in  prioritized R&amp;D with these markets that warrant a fantastic return, and  we'll be surgical in acquisitions that make sense.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you don't need to be in China.</p><p> BROWN:  No, we don't.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Greg, it's great to see you.</p><p> BROWN:  Maria, thanks very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations!  Greg Brown joining us there, CEO of Motorola  Solutions.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th.   Your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p> Markets are extending gains this morning, Futures indicating a solid rally  at the start of trading this morning, and it is strong, up 276 points right  now for futures, indicating a one percent rally right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 up 30 points, better than one percent higher, NASDAQ  up 98 points, that's 1-1/2 percent higher on the NASDAQ right now, </p><p> Similar story in Europe, we've got gains across the board.  Take a look at  the European indices with the FT-100 up two percent, 127 points higher on  the FT.  101 points higher on the CAC Quarante, that's better than two  percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 228 points, 2.15 percent higher  in Germany.  Little action in Asian markets overnight, as you can see, it  was a flat session overall and it was mixed.</p><p> President Trump has been tweeting this morning.  He just tweeted on his  Chief of Staff position, he says this, \"Fake news has it purposely wrong.   Many, over 10, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff  position.  Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful  jobs in Washington.  Please report news correctly.\" says the President,  \"Thank you.\"</p><p> Plus, Apple hitting the sales ban on older phones in China, the fallout for  the company coming up, this morning.  Apple shares are up 1-1/3 percent  right now.  And then, there's this, the bests of the bests, the list of the  top large companies to work for.  That list will be revealed this morning.   Time Magazine announcing its \"Person of the Year\" for 2018.  We will tell  you who Time chose.  That's also coming up this morning.</p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, pushing to save the U.K. exit  deal, Prime Minister Theresa May taking a trip across Europe postponing  today's scheduled vote on Britain leaving the European Union.  Ashley  Webster has been live in London this week.  He's got the very latest from  the ground.  Ashley, good morning to you.</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, good morning to you,  Maria.  It was supposed to be the day today, the day the voted on Theresa  May's deal, instead, the U.K. Prime Minister is off on a frantic round of  diplomacy today, heading from one European capital to the other, hoping to  persuade E.U. leaders to provide some concessions to her Brexit deal.   Earlier this morning, she had breakfast with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark  Rutte, they apparently had useful dialogue.  We understand what that means,  nobody knows.  </p><p> She then went on to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   There was a bit of an embarrassing moment when Mrs. May's car showed up and  was to be greeted by Angela Merkel and she couldn't get out of the car, the  door was locked (AUDIO GAP) to unlock it.  Embarrassing but perhaps an  interesting analogy of her being trapped in her own Brexit deal right now.  </p><p> And then later on today, she'll be heading to Brussels to meet with the  President of the European Council Jean-Claude Juncker.  Now, Juncker  himself spoke to the E.U. parliament earlier today in Strasbourg, France  and said very clearly that there is no renegotiating Mrs. May's Brexit  deal.  Take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COUNCIL:  We have achieved is the  best deal possible, it's the only deal possible.  No room whatsoever for  renegotiation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> WEBSTER:  No deal whatsoever, I think that's pretty clear as you can make  it.  We understand that the -- whatever deal that Mrs. May gets, she says  it will be voted on back here in the Houses of Parliament before January  21st.  And the clock is ticking, Maria, time running out.  They have until  March 29th to try and figure something out before the U.K. gets out of the  European Union, and it could indeed look more and more like a hard Brexit.  </p><p> Having said that, the sharks are circling around her job as well.  Tory  MPs, more MPs we understand have submitted letters calling for a vote of  confidence in her, as the Conservative Party leader and then Jeremy Corbyn,  leader of the opposition Labour Party is under pressure to call a vote of  no confidence in the government.  That hasn't happened yet, but certainly,  Mrs. May under the gun, doing her best to come back from Europe with  something, but at this point, it doesn't look like she's going to be able  to achieve very much, Maria.  Back to you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley, thank you so much.  We'll check back as news  develops.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.</p><p> I want to bring in John Browne, he is former member of Britain's  Parliament.  He's also Euro Pacific Capital --</p><p> JOHN BROWNE, FORMER MEMBER OF BRITAIN'S PARLIAMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- Senior Economic Consultant.  John, it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  Let me ask you right out.</p><p> BROWNE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your reaction to what has taken place last 48 hours in  London?</p><p> BROWNE:  Well, it's the most embarrassing situation.  It's -- the world is  laughing at the British circus.  After 13 months of squandered time, we  have no deal.  In fact, we have the deal that's worse than when we started.   It's -- it looks like a joke but it's very, very serious.  And it's very  serious not just for Britain and Europe, but it's a large section of world  trade with the second largest currency in the world, the European Union.   So, if things go bad, it's going to be bad for a lot of the world.  It's a  very serious situation, but it's reached a sort of laughing stock.  </p><p> And I get increasingly suspicious of Prime Minister May.  I thought she was  going to be honest and going for Brexit, but I look at this chaos, and I  have to ask myself, is it just an accident or is it by intent?  It looks to  me now when she comes back with an impossible deal which is worse than when  we started, that in a cricketing term, she's played the ball into the long  grass, which means you -- when you're losing a match, you try to lose the  ball so the match can't continue, and you end up with a draw.  And so, I  think --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what are you saying -- what are you saying, John?  Are you  saying she really doesn't in her heart of hearts want to leave -- she  doesn't want to really leave the E.U.?  Do you want to see a different  prime minister in the U.K.?</p><p> BROWNE:  Yes, she was, by her own admission, a remainer, she's a globalist.   She doesn't like Brexit at all.  And I think she's in league with the  European Union to play this thing the long game so that the impossible  situation, and gradually Brexit is renegotiated, negotiated and in fact,  we'll be back where we started but worst off because we won't have a  position on the board.  And of course, I feel like a growing majority of  conservative members of parliament that she must either tender her  resignation or be replaced by the 1922 committee in a vote of conservative  members of parliament.  I think it's becoming urgent because I think she's  doing the country great harm.  This whole journey to Europe, to me, is a  laughing matter, and it's made England look ridiculously and it's very,  very embarrassing and extremely serious.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  John, what is the most likely outcome going to happen?  I've  heard rumors -- it's John Layfield of New York -- I've heard rumors that  the 48 letters have already been gathered.  They've been gathered for some  time waiting on a no confidence vote to do that the right time.  Are we  going to see -- if we do see a new prime minister, it's going to  (INAUDIBLE) probably be a Conservative Party member?  Are we going to see a  hard Brexit, or is there a chance we're going to see another referendum  because what you have right now as you have articulated is not what 17.4  million Brits voted for to begin with?</p><p> BROWNE:  Exactly.  Now, of course, you could get rid of the prime minister  two ways: one is a vote of confidence in the floor of the House which would  mean the fall of the government and probably, looking at the polls, Jeremy  Corbyn is the next prime minister.  Heaven forbid!  But there are much  neater way -- there are much neater ways for the conservative parliament --  members of parliament to vote her out as leader of the party.  And so,  still have a conservative leader.  And hopefully, if that happened, and  probably likely if it happened, it would be a pro Brexit prime minister,  someone like Rees-Mogg or David Davis, or Boris Johnson, someone like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, meanwhile, the economy hangs in the balance.  I mean,  what kind of an impact does this all have on the U.K. economy?</p><p> BROWNE:  Well, it's uncertainty.  Nobody likes uncertainty.  Businesses  can't plan, and financial people have a very bad time, it's depressing on  business and financials.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  John, thanks much for joining us.  We appreciate your insights.   John Browne.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we've been reporting, Google's CEO Sundar  Pichai is headed to Capitol Hill today where he will be questioned by the  House Judiciary Committee.  Earlier we heard from Jim Jordan on the  committee.  Joining us right now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney with more right now.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, this is -- he is  -- so, Sundar Pichai is one of the world's most powerful people.  Google  knows absolutely everything about you.  And so, when he appears today,  there's obviously questions of privacy.  Google runs Gmail, somebody read  my Gmail, because I got a call from India about a Minor League's medical  problem that I have over the past couple of years.  The callers suggested,  oh, we can fix this.  How did that person get that information?  How  somebody read my Gmail, my personal Gmail.  And I'm not happy about it!   That's a gross invasion of my privacy.  Now, the deal is you get Gmail for  free, free communications, whoop-de-do, but they can sell that information,  and that information is available to third parties, and I don't like it.   And I want to know what they're going to do about it.  I don't know what  you can do about it, but I'm not happy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p> VARNEY:  And when it comes to censoring political views of conservatives  when it comes to building a search engine in China which is subject to  censorship and surveillance by the Chinese authorities, I think Google has  got a problem.  I think this is a very big deal.  We may get a hint of what  Congress might do to the Googles of this world later.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree with you.  These are real issues, and these are  issues that everybody gets touched by, whether it's privacy or the -- or  the censoring of speech, so this is -- this is important.  You think we'll  see more regulation at some point?</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, but I don't know what kind of regulation it's going to be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we're trying to understand better.</p><p> VARNEY:  I mean, the real answer would be real competition, but I don't see  how you get competition for a search engine which has got, what, 80 percent  of the market.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Google has 90 percent --</p><p> VARNEY:  90 percent.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- of the market for search.  Stu, I know you'll have a lot  more and we're going to come to you and see the hearing, live, happening at  10:00 a.m.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins at the top of the hour right after  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart and his guests, coming up.  And then,  that is when you will see the hearing where Sundar Pichai is to speak at  10:00 a.m.</p><p> But first, the best places to work, we're revealing which company took the  top spot this year right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Apple hit with a sales ban in China.  Gerri  Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that and  what's expected to be a strong rally this morning, Gerri.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  A big turnaround in  sentiment playing off of what we saw yesterday here.  Apple shares also  enjoying, they're bumped up as well after a Chinese court ordered the  iPhone maker to stop selling older model iPhones including the X, the 8,  the 7, and the 6.  Apple saying this in response, \"Qualcomm's effort to ban  our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices  are under investigation by regulators.  The significance of this first I.P.  court decision that seeks to curtail iPhone sales.\"  Meanwhile, Pegatron,  an iPhone assembler is exempted from this.  Interesting Taiwan-based  company.  </p><p> I want to get quickly here to the companies of the best places to work.   Starting with number five, Aflac, HubSpot, T-Mobile, number two, Google,  and this list put up by comparably.  It's a comp Web site.  Google number  two despite the fact that there was a walkout of employees over issues of  sexual harassment.  Numbers one on this list Costco, they say the benefits  for workers at Costco are very good, indeed.  Maria, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.  So, Costco, the best place to work.  Costco,  followed by Google, T-Mobile, HubSpot, and Aflac.  Thank you so much,  Gerri.  Great list there.  We'll take a short break.  </p><p> Then, when we come back, Time Magazine's \"Person of the Year.\"  We'll  discuss who was the most influential in 2018.  Also, I went to see Bocelli  last night.  I want to tell you all about it.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Well, the list is out, Time  Magazine makes it official, the \"2018 Person of the Year\", the Guardians,  journalist who have been targeted for their work.  There are four covers,  one features Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered Washington Post columnist,  another highlights Maria Ressa, a Philippine journalist.  The third  features two Reuters journalists who were arrested a year ago for their  reporting on Muslims, and the final cover shows the staff of the Capital  Gazette.  Their office, you know, was the target of a shooting earlier this  year.  That is the Time Magazine Person of the Year.  Reaction?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Meaningful and it expresses American values.  And the value of  the first amendment, and how journalist to break news, put their lives on  the line very often.  So, I give -- I give kudos to Time for this very  much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, this was a great idea to do this, and they should be  heralded and cherished for their important work.</p><p> Meanwhile, what a night last night.  I know I've been telling you all about  what I did last night.  I went to see Italian songwriter and tenor Andrea  Bocelli perform in New York City.  It was a private concert at the Columbus  Citizens Foundation.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was such a memorable night.  I love Andrea Bocelli.  I took  my sister and next to me is the wife of Andrea Bocelli, Veronica.  The --  and there's Lidia Bastianich, as well, along with myself and my sister.  We  talked about the Andrea Bocelli Foundation which raises money for  underprivileged people.  As the Columbus Foundation brought together the  Andrea Bocelli Foundation.  Thank you to both.  It was fun.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jealous.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good morning,  ladies.  Thank you so much.  We will see you in a little bit.  Big day  today.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 11th.  Your top stories right now  just before 6:00 a.m. on the EAST COAST.  Stocks are extending gains right  now, we are at the highs of the morning with a big rally underway.  Dow  Industrials set to open up this morning better than a hundred points, the  S&amp;P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 38 points, that's two-thirds of one  percent higher this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a wild day yesterday on Wall Street, markets were volatile, climbing  from the lowest to the end of the day in positive territory.  Big rally  toward the end of the day, taking the market off of the lows.  The Dow had  been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May  delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Then, by the  close, as you can see, markets reversed course.  Up 34 points at the close  on the Dow.  </p><p>Global markets this morning are also seeing a bit of a bounce, take a look  at FT-100 up better than one percent, 69 points higher, CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 71 points, one and a half percent higher, and the DAX Index in  Germany also higher by one and a half percent, that's a hundred and fifty- seven points higher this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets with little  change, as you can see there, very fractional moves and mixed.  Trade talks  are moving forward.  The U.S. and China holding a new round of negotiations  last night.  We have the very latest on where that stands.  </p><p>And coming together, President Trump set to meet with House Minority  Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and funding the border wall among top items on the  agenda, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will go to the White House.   Democrats reportedly ready to offer to $1.3 billion for the wall, but that  is the short of the President's $5 billion request.  Google's turn on the  hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai's headed to Capitol Hill today.  He will  testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  FOX Business will bring you  that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a look at what to expect  from his testimony this morning. </p><p>Then Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit losing its crown as the most  streamed song from the 20th century.  We'll tell you what tune knocked it  off the top spot, all that coming up this morning.  All those stories  coming up.  Joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John Layfield.  It's great to see you  this morning.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BEYOND SPORT GLOBAL AMBASSADOR:   It's great to see you.  Going to be a crazy week.  With the Brexit, its  potential government shutdown, this is going to be nuts. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Nice to see the green though in  the market this morning, really.  Positive reaction to some of this trade  news and especially in Europe, all in the green after yesterday's Brexit. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see how it closes.  The market's volatility has  been just unreal. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  It's a market that's  trading off headlines, that's trading off commentary, from somebody,  anybody, everybody, coming out of the White House, and I think that that's  going to be the case.  Other than the Federal Reserve meeting in the month  of December, that's really the only, like, hardcore piece of news that we  have coming up that we -- that we know about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We talked yesterday about the fact that the President of  France, Macron, has not been seen in the face of all of these riots.  We  did hear from him yesterday, Dagen.  What did do you think? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is pledging tax cuts and minimum wage hikes to placate  protesters, but, again, I want to point out that the -- kind of the kickoff  to these yellow-vest protests was a gas tax hike to push his environmental  agenda, and I think that that is an actually -- it's an honest move because  that is what it does take if you want to broadly reduce emissions and push  an environmentalist agenda.  It's -- everybody bears the cost of it.  That  gas tax hike has completely gone away, but the protestors have still been  out four weekends in a row so I -- I'm curious to see if this really does  kind of soothe the unrest. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he's out of touch, which is the -- which is the criticism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  But I need to give Nile Gardiner credit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I used the phrase \"swanning about the globe while (INAUDIBLE)  capital city is burning.  Nile used that phrase over the weekend.  So,  credit to Nile on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was great when he joined us to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- navigate all of this.  We got a big show this morning.   Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, Ohio Congressman and  House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan is here.  We're going to talk  with the Congressman about that Google hearing among other things.  Plus  Jim Comey, lots to talk about with Jim Jordan.  Michigan Congressman and  House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Debbie Dingell, is with us this  morning.  Congresswoman Dingell has a lot to say about General Motors.   Plus the Chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg Brown, is with us  this morning.  He's turned that company around.  </p><p>And Former British Parliament Member Euro Pacific Capital Senior Economic  Consultant, John Browne, is here as well.  Plus FOX News Senior Strategic  Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane joins us as well.  Don't  miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.  We kick it off  right here with this top story, and that is all of these swings in the  market.  Checking Futures right now, we're expecting a pretty strong  opening for today's trading.  Dow Industrials right now up a hundred and  twelve points, a half a percent higher after a wild day yesterday when the  Dow slid to session lows down better than 500 points after British Prime  Minister Theresa May announced a delay of the exit vote, Britain leaving  European Union.</p><p>But look at that chart, markets reverse in course, as the session wore on  and as you can see, after the lows hit at about 11:15 a.m. in the morning,  things slowly but surely came back only to end higher. When we were down at  11:15 market better than 500 points.  Market was briefly in correction  territory down 20 percent from the high, that means.  Joining us right now,  CIO, EventShares CIO Ben Phillips.  And Ben, it is good to have you on the  program this morning.  </p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CIO, EVENTSHARES:  Thanks for having me, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a market.  How are you doing with all this volatility?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, we've done some things in portfolio raise cash actually on  the Fed pop.  I guess that was a couple of Wednesdays ago.  So, we had a  big day up, markets were up about two percent.  We actually raised cash to  17 percent in portfolio. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.  Big number. </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  So, it was a meaningful move.  You know, I think the  thought was get a little more defensive.  We were pretty skeptical on  anything positive coming out of G20.  And so after we actually saw that  over the weekend, we started to look -- even get a little more defensive. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But longer term, has anything changed in terms of structural,  you know, performance for this market?  Look At the backdrop -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of growth expectations, higher rates, has anything  specifically changed that you really want to shift your allocation and hold  it in cash and just like -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, I think we have to realize that we are late cycle, and  there's going to be more late-cycle activity.  The Fed is pumping the  brakes and what that means is the rate-sensitive sectors are going to see  some of that, you know, giveback and that's what we're seeing.  I think  it's normal to see this type of activity towards the end of the cycle as  the Feds starts its heightening cycle.  So, you know, they said don't fight  the Fed for the past 10 years effectively, don't fight the Feds still, you  know.  They're tightening for a reason, that's going to have implications  on markets.  </p><p>BELL:  One trend that we've seen though on these days, these mornings when  you're up like this by a nice amount -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BELL:  -- we've seen that pop, initial pop, sold into the end of the day  and we end the day -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  -- at the lows, do you expect that today?  When can that trend turn  around? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes, you know, I hear the question.  It's tough to call it a  day-to-day move obviously.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  But I -- you know, I talked to people about a potential rally,  you know, a Santa rally, or even a January rally, which is somewhat  typical.  People are looking to fade, looking to sell into it.  So, I think  that's going to be a trend we're going to see here.  There's been a  rotation that's occurred at the hedge funds where they've derisked.   They've brought down leverage and now we're at a situation where they still  have a little bit more to go, I think.  They're still long tech, they're  still long momentum, so they still have some unwinding of that trade to do.   So, if they're actually thinking the cycle's over, or it's close to the  end, the -- that rotation's going to continue. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yesterday, we had all talks about Brexit, the week before, it  was all about G20.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  If you take out the geopolitical events and you trade only on  the market, what would the market be doing right now? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, that's tough.  It's tough.  I mean all we do is connect  the geopolitical events -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Right.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  -- to the market.  So, to say what would happen if there weren't  is -- I mean I think the market would be stronger.  I think, you know,  trade -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I guess my question is -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- are we headed for a recession, are we headed for a slowdown?   Would this market still be selling off even into a Christmas rally?  Which  looks to be a great Christmas retail season -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- but people wonder, is this is the last hurrah?  What's your  view?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think if we remove the geopolitical, we could see a rally  here.  We -- I think we should see a rally here.  Growth -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not expecting a growth slowdown?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  No.  What I think is causing it is the confidence crisis right  now.  We've seen China trade actually slowing some supply chains, causing  some drag on growth across the world.  So, that's happening.  Now, if there  is a true pause and we start seeing constructive discussions between U.S.  And China, we could see that actually, you know, reverse course in the  market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, we have a new round of trade talks that we are  reporting this morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade  Representative Robert Lighthizer, holding a call last night with their  Chinese counterparts, reportedly discussing agricultural purchases, changes  to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the Wall Street  Journal, and this comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei  CFO.  She's still waiting to find out whether she will be released on bail.   The decision could come today.  So, this is all intertwined.  </p><p>We did hear -- as soon as he came back from Argentina, Dagen, that the  President said China was going to buy all these agricultural products,  remember?  $1.3 trillion -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- was the number. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because of the trade fight that we've gotten into with China.   And it's a two-party fight, it's not a one-party fight, and it's really  hurt farmers.  Farmers have gotten multibillion dollar bailout from the  Federal government to help them out.  That will be good news.  But I would  caution that there needs to be one voice, while they -- while the U.S. goes  through these trade talks, there needs to be one voice on this, and I would  say it would be the President of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think investors have become accustomed to the way the  President communicates.  People can call it what they want, but that's who  he is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- as Donald Trump, President of the United States.  I think  that this is a moment where a lot of these talking heads in the WHITE HOUSE  need to stay off television.  And I said that yesterday about Peter  Navarro.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, there needs to be one voice and clearly there's been  fighting within the White House over time between Lighthizer, and Navarro,  and Mnuchin, and maybe even Larry Kudlow.  So, just let the President talk  about it.  That's it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apparently, they did have this call last night.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did that change opinions in your view on Wall Street in terms  of where we are in this negotiation? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  You know, I think it's positive to see that we're back at the  table.  Since July -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  -- really, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments weren't really  at the table at a senior level.  It was -- it was barely even junior  staffers having conversations.  So, it's positive to see that.  I think we  saw Trump and Xi go back home after the G20.  While there wasn't a joint  communication, they did go back home and they both tried to spend it  domestically.  \"Hey, we got some things done.  There is some progress.\"  We  took that as a positive cue.  If you look at one silver lining from the  G20, I think that's it, that they said \"We have to get something done  here.\"  They're looking at the markets, both of them.  Their respective  domestic markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you do think we're seeing this rally today because of this  new talk last night, right? </p><p>BELL:  Yes, I definitely think that the rally we're seeing -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what's pushing -- </p><p>BELL:  -- this morning is because of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right now.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  We also have another push for tax reform, Ben.  So what about that?   I mean House Ways and Means Committee Chairman -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I don't think that's what's driving markets today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Because Kevin Brady is retooling this tax cuts 2.0 right  now.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's trying to secure more Republican votes, the bill delayed  several healthcare taxes that allows expecting parents to create 529 plans  for their unborn children.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think that has an impact in any way, right? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  No, I think that the plan he released, I think it was the  Wednesday after Thanksgiving or the week after Thanksgiving was more  bipartisan-looking and I think that the revisions are more partisan.  And  so it seems pretty lame ducky some politicking at this point in time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And speaking of politics, I'll throw this in.  I'm hearing this  more and more from investors.  They're really waiting for the Mueller  report to come out, and they point to the two months before the Ken Starr  report came out in 1998, which was in September of that year, granted that  was the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management at that time as well, so  it's hard to separate the two, but in the two months, between mid-July and  the Starr report coming out in September, the S&amp;P fell almost 20 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  About -- more than 90 percent.  Granted the market made back all  that loss by the end of November, but this is -- people are standing back  and now waiting as more and more filings come out of the Mueller Team, out  of the U.S. Attorney in the -- for the Southern District of NEW YORK on  Friday, that's becoming a focus as well.  And I -- Gary B. talked about it  over the weekend. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's one of three really important things that will  probably give us a sense of what's going to happen in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, who did the Democrats put out there to go against  President Trump?  Number two, how's the economy doing?  We'll see if we are  in a growth slowdown come 2020, and number three, the Mueller report. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What comes out of Mueller?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to add one more thing.  I think the markets -- and I know  you'll agree with me, are -- you're getting a little bit of a lift moving  into the week because we did get an inversion of the yield curve between  the two-year and the 10-year to where, you know, if the shorter rates are  higher, that indicates the recession it has for the last 50 years, we  didn't get that last week, and I think that there was a bit of relief among  investors (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because as it was coming close, the two-year -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and the 10-year markets were selling off. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  As narrow as it was since 2007, but we didn't get that  inversion and -- </p><p>BELL:  And the reporting on the Fed potentially walking back, maybe taking  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  -- more of a dovish tone obviously played well into that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Do you buy into that?  Fed's not going to raise as many  as people think right now? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ray Dalio, by the way, told us he's not -- they're not going to  be able to do it three times next year.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I don't think so.  I mean, we look at -- if trade continues like  this, that is a drag on growth, and even if it's just discussions, it is  dragging growth, it's dragging confidence, so if we see this continue, I  don't think the Fed's hiking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ben, it's good to have you on the show.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ben Phillips joining us there.  Coming up,  Macron gives in, the French President pledging tax cuts now, and a minimum  wage increase following weeks of dangerous protests where more than a  billion dollars of damage was done.  Then Google is on the hill today, CEO  Sundar Pichai set to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee on  alleged bias against conservatives.  We're going to cover that live and  we'll talk about it next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More drama across the pond after the U.K.  Government postponed today's scheduled vote on its plan to leave the  European Union.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So many moving parts to this  story, Maria.  Good morning to you.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now in  Brussels after she postponed today's scheduled vote on Britain's plan to  leave the E.U.  May plans to meet with European leaders in order to signal  concessions on the deal, but the E.U. is already ruling out any further  negotiations.  And May could face a challenge to her leadership for rivals  in the Conservative party.  Well, Lord of the Rings actor, Andy Serkis,  reviving his old Gollum character to poke fun at U.K. Prime Minister  Theresa May and her precious Brexit deal, look. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDRY SERKIS:  They told us, precious, they hates the deal.  All of them  hates it.  They wants a People's vote.  People's vote.\" </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Sorry.  Serkis released the video over the weekend with the title  \"Leaked Footage from Inside Number 10 Downing Street.\"  The video has been  viewed, as you can imagine, more than a million times, it released ahead of  the planned parliamentary vote, which, again, is looking like it's going to  be pretty funny.  All right.  </p><p>Let's move to France.  Embattled President Emmanuel Macron promising to cut  taxes and increase the minimum wage as he addressed the nation last night.   His first public comments following four weeks of violent protests over his  economic agenda.  Macron admitting he is partially responsible for the  demonstrations led the by yellow-vest protestors who took to the streets to  oppose higher fuel taxes now they're government changes and been improving  the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator):  And I want to  see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries, and this is why I'm  ordering an end of year bonus for all employees without any tax. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  Last week, Macron suspended a hike in the fuel tax.   Maria, those are your headlines. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of drama coming out.  And I think, Dagen, you made  the point yesterday, \"Well, if you're in Britain, you could look across the  channel and thank God you're not in France right now.\"  What were -- what  were your thoughts of what we heard last night about -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which they think all the time.  I lived in Britain and they  don't really love the French.  They love the food, but not the people who  cook it because they -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think Europe's falling apart.  I've heard they've already got  the 48 letters signed and that they're really to be delivered at any point.   Nobody wants the Prime Minister role right now, but I think that the Brexit  ends up being probably a hard Brexit, which, if that happens, I think Italy  drops out of the E.U. as well, and the E.U. dissolves. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that -- this is a really important point that you're  making here.  I mean you said Europe is falling apart.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know what's going on in France, we know the situation in  Britain, then there's Italy.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the budget issues in Italy.  You're going to have an  election in Germany soon.  I mean -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And the big issue here is -- with -- I'm sorry to cut you off,  the big issue with Italy is if -- England has to -- U.K. has to stay in.   It will tell Italy they have to stay in as well.  If Italy -- if it sees  that England gets out, they could get out as well, which kills the E.U. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, there is something cultural going on that has always  been in place that Italy, they -- that they feel like it's important to  preserve their national culture and their national identity, and it's the  same in France, and it's the same in Britain not having a bunch of, quite  frankly, elitist snots in Brussels telling these countries what to do.  And  I think that it's been -- Macron said last night, this is this outrage by  the yellow-vest who's been 40 years in the making, he's trying to take some  responsibility for it.  But when you are one of those elitist snots, then  your people will turn against you.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  At least they're unelected elitist snots.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the problem, right?  That makes it better somehow?  </p><p>BELL:  This is also all happening when the economy over there is also  slowing down, too, but from lower Levels than we are seeing here, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Germany's contracting. </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was some (INAUDIBLE) yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think this eventually, you know, impacts the United  States though?  I mean, you know, we're talking about Europe falling apart.   This is a major story.  And it of course is going to impact how we see  growth in the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it already has.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Donald J. Trump is evidence of what was going on here  in the United States, the divide between the elitist in our cities, and our  coastal areas -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- and the rural -- and rural America.  People --  their politicians were not listening to people in the Hinterlands. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  All right.  We'll take a short break.   When we come back, there is real frustration at CBS.  Shareholders are  meeting today to talk about the possible legal risks over leaks associated  to the Les Moonves probe.  We've got those details.  And then we're  searching for answers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying today on  Capitol Hill over the search giant's alleged bias against Conservatives.   We'll take you there.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tech is taking the hill.  Google CEO Sundar  Pichai set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee later this  morning.  The Google CEO expected to answer questions on the company's  business practices, including its handling of user data, and potential  political bias.  Joining us right now to talk more about that.  First,  though, here's what House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told me on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FEATURES\" about this hearing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got the CEO of Google coming in to testify, what are you  looking to get out of that? </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, this is something  you have, too, that we've looked at this for quite some time because  technology affects so much of our life.  Two-thirds of every adult American  gets their news from the internet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Yes.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  But there -- there's no other company that has a greater control  over the internet on searches than Google, and Google has not been coming  to any of our hearing, whereas Twitter, Facebook, and others.  Ninety  percent of all internet searches goes through Google.  That's not news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see a regulation?  Are we going to see a bill  come to the floor about bigger power? </p><p>MCCARTHY:  This is why we're having the hearings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  What do we need to protect?  What do we need to stop the bias,  what do we need for competition. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Managing Director of Equity Research at  Wedbush Securities, Daniel Ives.  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you comes out of this?  And as an investor, what do we  need to focus on in terms of these technology companies? </p><p>IVES:  Well, because they're investors' regulation, and that continues to  be the sort of big threat for big tech.  You know, I think right here, you  know, Google's really been the last one to go in front of Congress.  So, I  think really in terms of how they navigate the data privacy, but I think  there's also a big focus on China because if you look at China, especially  with everything going on, you know, Google, how they're looking at  potentially getting into China from a search perspective, their view there,  as well as just the overall privacy, and that's really going to be front  and center here.  </p><p>But big techs' watching this, because, you know, this continues to be an  overhang on the space from a regulatory perspective. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Speaking about China, I mean Google decided to work with  China with its in A.I. and yet it said that it didn't want to work with the  Pentagon, it didn't want to be anywhere near the U.S. Government, and yet  tries to have this national score, individual scores for people where  they're watching you at all times, spying on you, and then at the end of  the year, you get a score and that may dictate if you can get on a plane,  get on a train, get a mortgage, I mean it's incredible.  And Google is  obviously enabling that. </p><p>IVES:  Well, because -- and that's why, like, they find themselves in the  crosshairs, because the thing about what's happening in broader with China,  you look at 5G, you look at this battle between U.S. and China across tech.   You're going to see more and more.  U.S. and tech are going to be battling,  you know, specifically on China when it comes to 5G, A.I., and Google is  sort of the center of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  And with regulation, regulation in the U.S. is very different from  China, very different from Europe, where they just passed the GDPR, General  Data Protection Regulation, this year.  How do these companies navigate  those waters?  What kind of expense does that cause and how do they get  from point A to being able to deal with all that? </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean with GDPR, I think that was when there was a big fear  going into that in May.  I think so far, you know, that's when it's been  pretty contained, and that's going to continue to be sort of a unicorn in  terms Of how much regulation you see overseas.  But, look, no doubt, I mean  look from an investor perspective, just given what we're seeing in the  market, the last thing you want to sort of come out of left field today --  and this also has given -- we saw yesterday with Apple getting Qualcomm and  China, you know, so that's the broader backdrop of tech where some of these  things were never factored into valuations.  Now you're seeing it.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  How do you trade Apple?  I've known Apple for years.  Obviously  got a big profit, it's had a great run-up, but right now, it's trading on  geopolitical news.  These, tariffs, as they kick in, could hurt the global  supply chain significantly.  Do you stay away from Apple completely here or  do you find some type of value here at a lower valuation?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And before you answer, let me just say that a Chinese court is  now ordering Apple to stop selling older iPhone models -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- after it found that the company violated two patents held by  Qualcomm. </p><p>IVES:  Yes, that was a major gut punch.  That really came out of left field  because if you go to Qualcomm-Apple situation, it's gone on for a long  time, you look what's happening in China, China is going to be 20, 25  percent of the incremental growth for Apple.  So, if you look at the  tariffs, you will get the situation right.  We continue to believe that  there's value in Apple here where it's trading, but no doubt, I mean if the  90-day period comes and tariffs get up to that 25 percent, and potentially  on iPhones, you know, that really could be a backbreaker for Apple. </p><p>But right here, we continue to be buying that name from a valuation just  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean the stocks now were at their lowest earnings  multiples in years because they've taken such a beating, so what are they  trading in now? </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean if you look right now, I mean look, $15.00 of earnings  for Apple?  OK.  You're talking about so that's now trading, you know, for  (INAUDIBLE) trade 12 to 16 times, trading below that historical range.  So,  you're are starting to get now down to trough levels where you're starting  to bake in some significant bad news into Apple.  OK, every day, the sun  comes up and there's bad news in Apple. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p>IVES:  So I think it's been just a massive string of bad news, if you've  seen the last six weeks, but ultimately a lot it's self-inflicted.  Because  you will get cooked.  Once they away took iPhone metric and transparency  decreased, that set off the storm here and you've continued seeing through  the suppliers. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  So do you not buy the services' idea?  That the service is going  from 10 billion to 50 billion, and Apple's now serves as company.  You  still think it's a hardware company that is dependent upon that sale of the  iPhones for the valuation.  </p><p>IVES:  Look, it's a services-led hardware company and we're talking about  the 50 billion in services -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Correct.  Yes.  </p><p>IVES:  -- in 2020.  That -- from sum of the parts, we believe that's worth  about 400 billion, that's service's business.</p><p>So, right here, you get in a core iPhone business, for 3 to 400 billion,  but, nonetheless, it's a hardware iPhone business in the near term, 60  percent that's where it comes from.  So, right now, that's going to rule  the day which is why right now, the disappointing we've seen with 10Rs  specifically added China, that's really been with the gut punch for Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you still like the stocks?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we -- look, we continue -- we're not waving the white flag on  Apple.  We are buyers of Apple here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about Google?</p><p>IVES:  Look, in our opinion right now, in large cap, we much rather own an  Apple versus some of these other names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>IVES:  You know, in large cap, just given the valuation and given we know  that there's a cycle there with regulatory risks with (INAUDIBLE) minimum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's Google on the hill today, so we'll see what happens with  the Alphabet parent of Google, Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>IVES:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Daniel Ives joining us.  Stay with FOX  Business, we're taking you live to Sundar Pichai's testimony, begins at  10:00 a.m. Eastern today, join us and we will roll on that for you.</p><p>First, though, a major meeting today between President Trump and top  Democrat leaders, with border wall funding at the Fore Front, Chuck Schumer  and Nancy Pelosi headed to the White House.</p><p>Then, Nirvana smells like teen spirit, losing its crown as the most  streamed song from 20th century, we'll tell you what tune knocked it off  from the top spot, coming up, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th,  your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Stocks are extending gains this morning.  Take a look at Futures,  indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning.  We are expecting  a big opening with the Dow Industrials up 160 points, that's two-thirds of  one percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ up almost one  percent, 60 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p>There is a run in technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major  comeback yesterday, check this out.  The Dow had been down 507 points, on  the news out of the U.K., and at the close, ended up 34 points.  Fractional  gain but it was a wild one and the market came all the way off of the lows.</p><p>The NASDAQ was up 51 points.  The market was initially hit as British Prime  Minister Theresa May cancelled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  Now, spokesperson for May is reportedly saying that the  government will bring the deal back for a vote by January 21st.  All right,  January 21.</p><p>In Europe this morning, rally there, as well, FT 100 up one and a quarter  percent, 85 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and two-thirds  percent, 78 points higher, DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 163  points higher right now, in Germany.  Small action in Asia, overnight, as  you can see, very fractional moves there, and it was a mixed story.</p><p>A new round of talks is underway.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talked to trade with China's  vice premier on the telephone, last night.  We are watching that.  And I  think that's one of the reasons this market has a firmer tone.</p><p>Then, America's farmers, in the spotlight, Congress is expected to pass a  five-year $867 billion-dollar farm bill, the compromise bill leaving out  (INAUDIBLE) work requirements for food stamps recipients.  We'll have all  the details, there.</p><p>Plus, the Moonves legacy, the CBS board meeting ahead of today's -- an  annual shareholders meeting, we'll tell you what members of the board are  reportedly concerned about on the Les Moonves exit.</p><p>And then, there's this, the Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, has lost  its crown as the most steamed song from the 20th century, the tune that  knocked it out, coming up, right here.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is a shutdown showdown, President Trump is  expected to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, today, at the White House.</p><p>They are trying to strike a deal on funding for the border wall.  The  Democratic leaders will reportedly offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall,  that is a stark difference from the $5 billion, the President is  requesting.  The meeting comes ahead of the looming December 21st deadline  to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>I spoke with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" Sunday.  He weighed in on advice for today's big meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  are going to be meeting with the President on Tuesday, to talk  about the spending bill and the border wall funding.  Why can't the Senate  get on board with the President's border wall funding, sir?</p><p>GRAHAM:  Look at the caravan, look at the charge against the border, look  at the caravans that are to come, look at the holes in our border security,  so here is the problem, you've got the Democratic leader to be in the  House, calling border security, a wall component, immoral.</p><p>If I'm President Trump, Tuesday, I would tell Nancy Pelosi and Chuck  Schumer that we're going to build a wall where it makes sense.  If I were  the President, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding.   I want the whole 5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.</p><p>1.6 is available to the President, he wants 5, and after the caravan, if  you don't see the need for additional border security, you're just not  paying much attention, so Mr. President, dig in, do not give in when it  comes to the law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it the Senate who's stopping this?  I mean, every  time we ask congressman, they say it's passed.  We've got the money in the  House.  It's the Senate.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, you've got to have the speaker of the house who will be in  charge next year, what about next year?  So here's what's happening in the  Senate, we need 60 votes to get 5 billion.  If I were the president, I  would tell the Democrats, I want $5 billion for wall security because for  border security, including a wall, because we need it from the threats  we're facing, this caravan and others to follow.</p><p>And I'd put DACA on the table.  There are 700,000 young people who came  here on the average age of 6, have got no place to go.  They're in the DACA  program, if I were the president, I'd say, I want two years of wall funding  and I'll give legal status to the DACA recipients.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GRAHAM:  That's good deal for the country.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst,  Retired General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Your reaction -- </p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see  you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to all of this, will the President get the money?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know, because I'm not good at testing the  temperature, you know, the Congress of the United States.  I think,  fundamentally, the wall is necessary.  Take the politics out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  The border and customs people have been telling us for years, we've  got 600 miles of border security right now, in terms of some kind of  fencing.  And as we have seen in recent television exposures -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  some of that is inadequate, so we've got to fix that.  And then,  we've got to build about 800 more miles of fencing or wall to provide some  degree of security.  And then, there's about -- you know, we've got about  2,500 miles of border, so we're not going to build it in all places, but we  need in certain places, the funnel people in other place where the border  control and customs people can be -- to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  I mean, it is fundamentally a sovereignty issue, Maria.  I think  the President -- the strength of the argument is on his side, given what we  have seen in the last few weeks, with people coming by the thousands, even  though most of them are motivated in terms of economic opportunity, some of  them are motivated because they're passing drugs and they're criminals, but  the overall majority just want a better life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, and we've got that.  But, you know, other people that are  standing in line by the thousands, in front of them, and they've got to get  behind that line, and we've got to get some kind of control.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's an important meeting today, because, you know, the  President has talked about striking deals with the Democrats on  infrastructure, but they've been pretty -- you know, they've been saying,  look, we're not giving you any more money for this wall beyond 1.3 billion.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how he can -- it's an early test of his  ability to work with the Democrats on anything.  But let's get to defense  budget, because this is something I know you care about so much, the  President has told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to submit a $750 billion  budget proposal for fiscal 2020.</p><p>I spoke with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday, he weighed in on the  border funding battle, as well as defense spending.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this all about getting the money for the President's border  wall?  Is that what this fight is about?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We need our borders, stronger, strong and secure, especially  with the caravan and others.  In the House version, we have five billion.   The Senate version has 1.6, and what the President is saying is, I want a  deal.</p><p>That's why Schumer has a process in this, but he's going to have Schumer  come in.  Now, Nancy Pelosi is in a different position.  She's having a  battle to become speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You have to have 218 votes on the floor, so that's January --  but we have to get this all done in the next two weeks.  You know the type  of new members she has, coming in.  They're much more socialist  progressive.  They don't go to her office to visit her.  They go to her  office to join in the protest, so she has a challenge that she doesn't want  to vote for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She doesn't want anything done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She wants to be speaker.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Exactly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there you go, General, she doesn't want to vote for  anything, she wants to be speaker.  She's not going to do anything  different to rock the boat on her speakership.  But the defense budget is  basically already funded, but now, what's your take on 2020?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, this is a huge thing that the President has done, because the  Director of OMB, Mulvaney, tasked every single department in our government  to take up five percent haircut cut to include defense -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  which would've stopped the Trump build-up, and what has happened  here is, the chairmans of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee and  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have met with the President and said, Mr.  President, if you do that, then the Trump build-up is going to stop and  we're going to go right back to where we were, before you became president.</p><p>And so, he has decided, we're going to increase the defense budget, which  is, I was on a commission for a year, the Commission on the Defense  National Strategy, looking at this.  And we believe that you need three to  five percent increase, to account for two percent inflation increase, so  you can grow the budget.</p><p>So, that is where we are, and that will be -- that will be argued with the  Democrats who are going to control the House Armed Services Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's even for 2020, right?  The $750 billion -- </p><p>KEANE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  for 2020?  General, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, shareholders shaken, a  big meeting today at CBS, to talk about potential leaks associated with the  Les Moonves scandal, we are on it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Five Marines missing after a crash off of Japan.   They've now been declared dead.  Cheryl Casone with details and headlines  now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Those five Marines went missing after a mid- air collision off the coast of Japan, south of Muroto Cape.  There is the  map for you on your screen.  The U.S. Marine Corps has suspended its search  after a refueling plane collided with the F-18 Hornet fighter jet late last  week during regularly scheduled training.  The weapon's system officer in  that jet ejected, he survived; the pilot also ejected but was later  pronounced dead.  </p><p>Well, CBS board members are reportedly concerned about the legal  ramifications of the investigation into Les Moonves' alleged sexual  misconduct.  Wall Street Journal reports they are worried that leaks could  expose the networks to even more legal liability, some are calling for a  probe into the source of these leaks.  Amid all of this, folks, CBS  shareholders are holding annual their annual meeting today; protestors  expected outside to demand the company deny Moonves' $120 million severance  payout.  </p><p>Well, Universal Music Group has released its list of for the most streamed  songs from the pre-streaming era.  You know, the 70s, folks.  And only one  song reigns supreme.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FREDDIE MERCURY, VOCALIST, QUEEN:  Any way the wind blows doesn't really  matter to me, to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" the most streamed song from the 20th Century.   It is also seen as spiking popularity, obviously, since the release of the  Freddie Mercury biopic movie that came out last month, which was huge hit,  by the way at the box officer.  Here is the rest of top five: at number  five, \"Take on Me\" by A-ha -- remember that one?  Right?  I love that we're  all 80s kids here.  Guns 'n Roses, has the next two spots with \"November  Rain\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\"  Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has  been played more than 1.5 billion.  And yes, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" despite  being six minutes long, number one, 1.6 billion streams.  I love that we  all get each other in our musical taste. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love all of those songs.  </p><p>CASONE:  Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think I'm going to have \"Take on Me\" in my head all day,  though, now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A-ha, of all bands, to make the top five.  And \"November Rain,\"  really, kind of one of the bottom, like, five songs ever recorded by G&amp;R.   What about \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" or (INAUDIBLE), any of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, where was that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, take a break, when we come back, the finer  things; why more people are investing in their money in fine arts?  That's  straight ahead.  Wait until you see what we've got to show you next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

More and more are  turn to fine art as a way to invest their money according to the 2017 Night  Frank Luxury Investment Index, art was the most popular luxury investment  ahead of assets like wine, coins and jewelry.  Joining us right now is Fine  Art Curator, Michael Witmer.  Michael, it's good to see you, thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>MICHAEL WITMER, FINE ART CURATOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us what's been happening over the last, what, couple  of years in number of the number of billionaires investing their money in  art?  </p><p>WITMER:  We're seeing more billionaires being created than ever before.   We're seeing them being created in far fun places where we haven't seen  billionaires before throughout Asia: China, India, and places like  Malaysia, the Philippines which didn't have many billionaires.  They're  building their own museums, they're pushing up the prices.  We will  continue to see blue chip prices go through the roof because that's what  they want for the walls of their museums.  So, we're seeing the supply go  down and demand go up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of art are they most interested in?  </p><p>WITMER:  They seems to be interested in real museum pieces for --  especially French impressionism, early modern artist like Picasso, Mone,  van Gogh.  We will probably see prices of the good old (INAUDIBLE) start to  go up again.  And once we see those go up, there's no stopping them.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Is it (INAUDIBLE) independent.  (INAUDIBLE) American  billionaires buys different artist, a Da Vinci art or a Picasso for  instance, compared to, say, Asian billionaires?  </p><p>WITMER:  It used to be that way.  But now, we've seen a worldwide increase,  drastic increase in museum attendance, more people are studying art history  than ever before.  If you look 26 years ago with the Louvre, there were 2.5  million visitors and they thought they would never get that high.  Last  year and the year before, it was just barely shy of 10 million visitors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>WITMER:  Most major museums are seeing that.  So, as a result, to answer  your question, we're seeing the museums throughout the world, the  billionaire collectors throughout the world now collecting the same thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this story.  I want to ask you about this mystery,  though, in the art world.  Last year, we saw the most expensive art sale on  record.  We talked about it on this program a lot, you came on the show to  discuss it.  This was Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi.  It was bought  by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $450 million.  Now,  the master piece has not been seen since its purchase last year.  Scholars  are worried about where it is, where is this painting, where do you think?  </p><p>WITMER:  At $450 million, that painting had its own armed guards and  escorts everywhere it went.  It was probably as safe as President Trump has  ever been.  It's not uncommon in the part of the world for the buyers to  hang something in the living room, enjoy it for a little while, and then  share it with the world.  Also, because they're building beautiful new  Louvre museum that is now opened, it's spectacular.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Saudi.  </p><p>WITMER:  Yes, and they're building more -- that's in Abu Dhabi, and they're  building more museums throughout that region.  So, they may be looking to  make more acquisitions before they show everything.  The idea that one 450  million-dollar Leonardo is not enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazing story.  Yes, maybe it is in MBS's home?  </p><p>WITMER:  Could be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>WITMER:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We will be right back.  Google is in the  hot seat.  We're going to talk about a CEO Sundar Pichai headed to Capitol  Hill to testify, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 11th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Stocks are rallying this morning, extending gains of yesterday.  Futures  indicating a big market day with the Dow Industrials up 180 points --  that's three-quarters of 1 percent.  S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent, 17  points higher.  And the Nasdaq right now up almost 1 percent, 60 points  higher right now after a wild session yesterday.</p><p>Markets plummeted initially and then climbed from the lows to end the day  in positive territory, up 34 points when all was said and done.  The Dow  had been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa  May delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Her  spokesperson today is saying that the vote will take place before January  21st.  Markets ended stronger and are continuing the rally today.</p><p>Global markets meanwhile are also higher.  FT 100 in London, up one and a  third percent, 92 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up one and three-quarters  percent, 84 points higher.  And the DAX index in Germany up 200 points,  that's almost 2 percent higher in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets little changed, as you can see fractional moves  across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile trade talks are moving forward.  This is one reason the market  has a firmer tone as well.  The U.S. and China held a new round of  negotiations last night.  We will tell you about the phone call that  happened on that story, coming up.</p><p>And then Google's turn on the hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai is headed  to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  Fox  Business will bring you that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a  look at what to expect from this testimony, coming up.</p><p>On the short list, President Trump among the final candidates on the  magazine's Person of the Year.  We're taking a look at the other names on  the list later this hour.</p><p>And Steph Curry going viral but not for his play on the basketball court.   His comments about the moon landing, landing him in hot water.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  contributor John Layfield.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  I don't know what  Stephen Curry is smoking.  But he thinks the moon landing is fake.  He  could be the greatest shooter of all time.  He's certainly in the top five  but that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He just doesn't believe it?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  He said, check out Stanley Kubrick who -- there's a big  conspiracy theory that he filmed this for Apollo for nationalism and for  the government.  And apparently he doesn't.  I don't know -- I couldn't  figure out if he was joking or not.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors are saying please, anything but this talk.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I've got some chem trail  theories and flat earth ideas that I can sell him if he's -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, Kyrie Irving, the other great NBA (INAUDIBLE) said we do  have a flat earth.  So you have that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm no -- people laugh at the chem trails and the flat earth.   But they're out there.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile President Trump is still looking for his new chief of  staff.  Mark Meadows among the names really coming to the top of the list.</p><p>We've got a market that is rallying this morning. </p><p>Earnings keep beating estimates.  What else are you watching?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are you watching?  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Well, I think the biggest risk  to the market right now is this trade spat.  So I think the sooner we get  this resolved, the sooner we can resume daily operations of businesses  across the globe, really.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a phone call last night with Steven Mnuchin and his  counterpart that we're going to talk about coming up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I was just going to say, I think that -- and I've said  this on the program before when Lindsey was here.  I think business owners,  operators, CEOs, are getting to the point where they're just not going to  make any investment decisions for the next two years, waiting for the next  presidential election.  That's the danger.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And cap spending.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  If it looks like that you have a White House in chaos that  can't get its messaging straight, they can't get any trade deals done  beyond here, you're looking at a really long slog for the next two years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what the Democrats would like.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  We've got a big meeting happening today between the  President and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining the conversation Ohio Congressman and House  Judiciary Committee member Jim Jordan is with us on the day that Sundar  Pichai testifies in front of his committee.  Michigan congresswoman and  House Energy and Commerce committee member Debbie Dingell is here to talk  about General Motors.  Plus the chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions --  he's turned this company around  Greg Brown is joining us.  And former  British parliament member, Euro-Pacific Capital senior economic consultant  John Browne joining us.  As well as the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\", Stuart  Varney weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off at this hour with this top story.</p><p>It was a wild day on Wall Street yesterday and it's looking good today.   Futures indicating a higher opening to the tune of 200 points at the start  of trading this morning after a volatile session yesterday.</p><p>The major indices closed in the green yesterday but that was really just  part of the story.  They bounced back from early losses which were sparked  by escalating fears over the fate of U.S.-China trade and what happened in  the U.K.</p><p>The Dow slid to session lows about 11:00 a.m. after British Prime Minister  Theresa May announced the delay of the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  But from that point on, it was a climb to positive  territory.  Her spokesperson today this morning says that that vote to  leave the E.U. will take place before January 21st.</p><p>Joining us right now is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment officer, Krishna  Memani.  Krishna -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OPPENHEIMER FUNDS:  Pleasure to  be here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you handling all this volatility?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, it's not pleasant.  It's not fun.  But at the end of the day  it's part of the markets.  Having said that, I think what we need to focus  on is the underlying economic strength.  The economy continues to do well,  rates are relatively low.  So I think we are still looking for a positive  outcome in the long run.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you buy stocks here or do you want to -- </p><p>MEMANI:  Oh, absolutely.  I think cash is a good alternative.  But if you  have a long-term -- if you want to retire, you know, 2 percent, 3 percent  just doesn't get you there.  So you'll have to take risk and earn returns  in the long run and I think equities are still very good value in that  context.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much of the volatility that you've seen recently is do you  think can be attributed to the reduction, the $50 billion a month reduction  in the Fed's balance sheet, now below $4 trillion.  You had some serious  liquidity and trading problems in the markets last week where people, you  had those exchange traded funds, those bond ETFs where the actual trading  price was below the net asset value which isn't really supposed to happen,  which tells you that the investors didn't really know what the bonds in  those portfolios were worth.</p><p>How much of that is contributing to the overall market swing?  </p><p>MEMANI:  So the balance sheet reduction at the Fed is clearly a factor in  the market, reducing liquidity in the market is an issue.</p><p>I think volatility causes ETF prices to be away from what their net asset  value is all the time.  So I don't read too much into that.  But the Fed,  if it continues to tighten or if it continues down the path of reducing its  balance sheet in a very aggressive way, I think that will have negative  consequences in the market.</p><p>Having said that, we believe the Fed will stop sometime in first half of  2019, because the economy would have slowed down and the inflationary  pressures that they're worried about just won't manifest themselves.  So  maybe one or two times tightening and the Fed stops.</p><p>So if you step back, the two issues driving the market -- the Fed,  tightening by the Fed, and trade.  I think we are on the verge of resolving  the Fed issue.  The trade issue is an open political issue that, you know,  somebody can solve that problem tomorrow -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a phone call last night, they're talking about this  being a new round of trade talks taking place last night.  Treasury  Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  held a call with their Chinese counterpart, reportedly discussing  agriculture purchases, changes to China's fundamental economic policies,  according to the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>It comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei's CFO.  She's  waiting to find out whether she's going to be released on bail.  That  decision could come today.</p><p>So Krishna -- I mean what do the markets expect here in terms of, you know,  looking at these recent developments from the CFO getting arrested to this  Argentina meeting -- what's priced into the market?  </p><p>MEMANI:  I think the market is still expecting trade issues to continue for  a reasonably long period of time.  And I think the driver of that is the  fact that U.S. economic strength gives the Trump administration the  flexibility to continue this path.</p><p>However, by the middle of next year when the U.S. economy is kind of back  to 2 percent, unless the Trump administration wants to take the risk of the  economy slowing down even further, I think they will be forced into a  situation to make some sort of compromise.</p><p>So I think the trade conflict continues for a bit longer but I think even  that will get resolved middle of next year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that beginning to get priced into this market, a  slowdown?  Is that what investment participants believe -- 2 percent next  year this time?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Oh, yes.  I think in August and September we were talking about  sustained growth rate, higher inflation.  I think all of that has been  flushed out in the market by October, November.  </p><p>BELL:  Well tech has been a major area under pressure because of all this  trade issues.  But you saw yesterday in the comeback, it was led by Apple,  it was led by the tech sector, and it was led by the semiconductors, up 2  percent, 3 percent across the board.</p><p>And you're seeing that actually this morning, the Nasdaq is leading.   You're seeing some of the semis do well again today.  Do you think that  bodes well?  Can these stocks carry us into the end of the year, maybe give  us that Santa rally?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, I think if there is going to be a Santa rally, it will  involve tech in a big way.  There's no doubt about that.  And I think  valuations in tech have improved quite substantially.  They have had a  significant correction.</p><p>I think for the long run, we continue to believe that a trend growth rate  where growth will be around 2 percent, tech companies that have been  delivering significantly better growth rate topline, profitability growth  will lead the rally.  </p><p>It will never be about value.  It will always be about growth and it will  always be about tech companies if this rally continues as we expect.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  On the rally, we have consumer confidence at an 18 year high.   We have unemployment at a 50-year-low.  We have wages that are up.  Looks  like we're going to have a really good Christmas retail season.</p><p>The question is what happens next.  Do you think this is the last big  hurrah before we slide back to 2 percent growth?  </p><p>MEMANI:  I think the economy is already slowing down.  You know, the  consumption part was always robust.  What we needed was capital spending.   That ticked up a little in the first half and subsequent to that, it's been  slowing down. </p><p>I think that's the part that is missing and that is what ails the global  economy.  The desire to invest on business' part is just not there.  Things  like trade issues make it even less so and I think that's why we need to  resolve it.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  You didn't mention Brexit at all.  Brexit yesterday, the market  dipped significantly, came back later because of what might, could or could  not happen.  Does Brexit factor into this in a big way next year?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving, you know, unfortunately.   You know, the likelihood that they will get a deal that everyone would like  is basically zero.  So we will have to reach some sort of compromise.  It's  political posturing on all sides.</p><p>But at the end of the day, before middle of next year they have to find a  solution.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The United States has been kind of the stronger of the global  economies broadly speaking.  You've got Germany is now contracting, Japan  contracting.  Can businesses here in the United States up capital spending?   How does the rest of the world impact what happens here at home?</p><p>Does that make sense?  Like, I know we don't operate in a vacuum.  But can  you see an uptick in capital spending if the rest of the world doesn't look  so great?  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, so I think that's a fair point.  If emerging markets were  accelerating and Europe was accelerating, I think the desire to invest to  support those markets would be higher.</p><p>But U.S. has been the fastest growing market for quite some time.  At least  the relative to trend has been the fastest growing market.  With that, if  the investment didn't come through, the likelihood that it will come  through and the U.S. economy slows down to 2 percent I think is less  likely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line do you want to buy stocks or allocate some money to  fixed income right here?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MEMANI:  No.  I want to buy stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>MEMANI:  I think stocks are good for the long run.  They have cheap  valuation.  The economy is doing quite well and markets are going to go up  over the next two, three years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Krishna -- it's good to see you.</p><p>MEMANI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Krishna Memani from Oppenheimer there.</p><p>Coming up, Google is on the hot seat today.  Find out what lawmakers want  to know as Google's CEO Sundar Pichai takes to Capitol Hill this morning to  testify in front of the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Then \"Time's\" Person of the Year -- that person will be revealed this  morning.  Top candidates -- President Trump and Russian President Vladimir  Putin among the ideas.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Congress is getting ready to grill Google's CEO Sundar Pichai today about  the company's data collection, the alleged political bias.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details right now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And a lot more, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And a lot more.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Pichai expected to tackle all of these allegations head on  today.  In his prepared testimony, Pichai is going to say quote, \"I lead  this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products  continue to operate that way.  To do otherwise would go against our core  principles and our business interests.\"</p><p>Now, lawmakers also are expected to question Pichai about Google's plan to  build a censored search engine in China.  Fox Business is going to have  live coverage of the Google CEO.  That hearing, 10:00 a.m. Eastern time  this morning.</p><p>Well Pichai's appearance coming just one day after Google announced it is  shutting down its social network, Google Plus, earlier than anticipated  because of a privacy flaw.  Google says a glitch exposed the personal  information of 52 million users in November.</p><p>This is the second time in two months that Google has disclosed the  existence of a problem that enabled unauthorized access to these Plus  profiles.  The second one, a lot larger than the first, we should add.</p><p>Well, Carlos Ghosn is facing more time in a Japanese jail.  A decision by a  Tokyo court means the former Nissan chairman will remain in custody through  at least December 20th with no option for bail.  Ghosn was indicted  yesterday for allegedly filing false financial reports that understated his  pay by about $44 million.</p><p>Prosecutors also laying out new suspicions that Ghosn underreported $36  million in income between 2016 and this year, underreported.  Ghosn has  denied any wrong-doing in all this, we should say.  Shares of Nissan are  down 14 percent, Maria, so far this year.  But he is staying in jail.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you know he's denying all of this and we still  haven't heard from him.  And they won't allow him to speak to his family.   So he's in this jail cell, sitting -- sleeping on a cot, eating porridge,  I'm told, and told you can't talk to your lawyer, you can't talk to your  family.</p><p>He could be facing 10 years of jail time, Dagen -- and we know what was  going on behind the scenes and underneath all of these, you know,  malfeasance headlines.  And that is, he wanted to merge Nissan with  Renault, the French company.  The Japanese were not happy about it.  They  do not want to be acquired, one of their jewels, the Nissan company, to be  acquired by the weaker, financially weaker French company, Renault.</p><p>And he as the journal reported the other day, he was about to replace the  CEO of Nissan who very conveniently turned on him in three seconds when he  found out that.  So I think there's more to this story.  It's political and  it's really a shame to see this and Japan calls itself capitalists.  What  do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Increasingly it looks like -- I think it's fair to at least  raise the question, was he railroaded? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, I think it upends confidence in the global  economy when maybe investors realize there is no rule of law in Japan that  if you do business in Japan, you're going to get treated differently than  in a country like the United States of America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially if you're talking about one of the jewels of Japan,  and that is the automaker, you know.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an incredible story.  We'll keep watching it.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this, this morning.  Coming up, NBA star Steph Curry in  hot water today over his comments about the moon landing.  Wait until you  see what he said.</p><p>Then, the only list that includes Duchess Meghan Markle and special counsel  Robert Mueller.  We're taking a look at the candidates for \"Time  Magazine's\" Person of the Year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The two most annoying people on earth.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are waiting on \"Time Magazine's\" 2018 Person of the Year.   Who will it be.  We will find out later this morning. </p><p>Until then Lauren Simonetti is here.  She's sharing the potential top 10 --  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  We've got the short  list.  The list that puts Meghan Markle and Robert Mueller, as you noted,  in the same place and also Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Robert Putin -- well, I went to the Fox party that's why I'm a little foggy  this morning.  </p><p>All right.  Let's give you the \"Time\" Person of the Year short list for  2018. </p><p>You can see, looking at this list, that in the running are -- show me the  list.  Ok, I'll just go on my own. Jamal Khashoggi, he was one -- the Saudi  journalist that was murdered.  He made it.</p><p>Donald Trump, now he took the cover in 2016.  He was the winner right after  he was elected.  But this year, Donald Trump making the short list for his  controversial policies including a policy on separated families.  Families  that were affected by his zero tolerance policy that has ended but still  kids remain not united with their families.  So separated families is an  option.</p><p>Vladimir Putin, of course.  He won a landslide victory for another six  years back in March.  He's on the list for his, you know, the Russian  poisoning of the ex-Russian spy and also tensions with the Ukraine.</p><p>Robert Mueller makes this list.</p><p>The March for Our Lives activists after the school shooting at Stoneman  Douglas in Florida.  They make this list.</p><p>Of course, Meghan Markle, married Prince Harry, now pregnant with child.</p><p>So we'll see in the next hour who is the \"Time\" Person of the Year for  2018.</p><p>Last year, do you guys remember the cover last year, in honor of the #MeToo  movement.  It was the silence breakers.  So you see the popular names such  as Ashley Judd, the actress and Taylor Swift but also, you know, the woman  all the way on the left is a strawberry farmer in Texas.  So women speaking  out against sexual harassment.  That was 2017.</p><p>What do you guys think for 2018?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this cover used to be like the iconic cover that we all  waited and wanted to know about.  I don't know that it has the influence  that it once did.  What do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's a pamphlet.  It's not a magazine anymore, number  one.  Number two, here's my prediction.  It's not going to be Meghan  Markle, the most annoying person walking on planet earth.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Why do you think she's the most annoying person?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because she's the most annoying person walking on planet earth.   Can we actually -- she's not the first woman to ever get pregnant, how  about that?  </p><p>BELL:  She did marry a royal.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's such a divided time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She married a royal.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  If they go with Meghan Markle, I think there will be less to  say about the cover because it won't be as controversial.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why would it be Meghan Markle?  Was she really the Person of  the Year?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Christine Blasey Ford.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No -- Donald Trump.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  She has a chance.  You think Donald Trump again?  So he would  fill two covers in his first term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They probably won't give him two covers.  Yes, you're right.   Maybe it's Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It might be the -- I think it might be the people of the March.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL:  This is America.  We can't have Vladimir Putin on the cover.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  You're right.  That doesn't seem right.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  The most influential person in the world, though it has to be  President Trump.  It has to be.  Right or wrong, he is the person at the  center of almost everything going around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I think too.  </p><p>BELL:  That's what I think too.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Everybody else essentially on this short list because of  President Trump and one of his controversial policies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's an idea.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know what, maybe it will be Donald Trump again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here's an idea.  I don't know if you mentioned.  It's Elon Musk.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He's not on -- he didn't make the short list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Ok.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Meghan Markle did.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The \"Black Panther\" director made the short list.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The \"Black Panther\" director -- that would be awesome.  That  would be a great pick.  And it might actually sell some of those \"Time\"  pamphlets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about Lady Gaga?  She's not on the list either.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  She didn't make the list either.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If she wins an academy award, maybe.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Have you guys seen that movie?  \"A Star is Born\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:;  The best movie ever.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.  And now the song is on the radio.  You know what, we  should redo the short list, put Lady Gaga on it and Elon Musk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll just keep chatting about everything all day.</p><p>Ok.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, aiding General Motors.  Tesla is thinking about purchasing GM's  old plants.  We've got the details on this partnership.  Stock is up 3  percent right now on that.</p><p>And then attacking holiday debt, are you in debt already?  Find out how you  can avoid overspending this holiday season, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th.   Your top stories right now 07:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>The bulls are making a run this morning, take a look.  We're at the highs  of the morning right here, Futures indicating a rally at the start of  trading to the tune of 220 points, up one percent on the Dow, up almost one  percent on the S&amp;P and up better than one percent on the NASDAQ, 75 points  higher on the NASDAQ right now.  </p><p>Technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major comeback  yesterday.  Remember when the Dow was down 507 points yesterday?  Yes, it  happened at about 11:15 a.m. only to bounce off of that level and work  their way back to finish the day higher.  Dow Industrials ended the day up  35 points, a fractional percentage move.  S&amp;P was up four and the NASDAQ up  three-quarters of one percent, 51 points higher yesterday.  </p><p>Initially stocks were hit as British Prime Minister Theresa May canceled  the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.  That speech happened  at 11:15.  That's when the markets bounced at the end of her speech.  And  this morning we are hearing that British police, armed British police  reportedly detained a man inside the parliament grounds.  No word yet on  why he was there, why he was detained.  This is a developing story.  We  will bring it to you.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in European trading this morning, we're seeing gains there as  well, FT-100 up 1-1/2 percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany up almost two percent right now, 204 points higher  in Germany.  </p><p>Small action in the Asian markets overnight meanwhile.  Fractional moves as  you can see across the board.  </p><p>A new round of talks meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S.  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talks trade with China's Vice- Premier on the phone last night.  We're going to break it down.  This is  being seen as a big positive step in this trade truce.  </p><p>Money for the border, details on today's meeting between President Trump  and top Democrats including Nancy Pelosi.  The Dems reportedly offering  $1.3 billion to fund the border.  </p><p>Then, surviving the holidays, how you can save on your holiday spending and  keep yourself from sinking into debt.  Many people still paying off last  year's holidays.  </p><p>Plus this, NBA star Steph Curry is in hot water this morning over his  comments about the moon landing.  We'll tell you about it coming up.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, General Motors shutdown, the  automaker announcing last month that it will close five North American  plants and lay off 14,000 workers.  But in an interview at \"60 Minutes\",  Elon Musk says buying those plants is a possibility.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLEY STAHL, CORRESPONDENT, CBS:  Would you want to buy some of those  plants, those factories, that they're closing down?  You're shaking your  head yes.  </p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  It's possible that we would be interested.  If they  were going to sell a plant or not use it that we would take it over.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  Good morning and it's good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, give us your sense of the impact of the G.M.  announcement.  I think I saw you quoted the other day that G.M. is now the  least liked company in Washington.  People are really angry about these  layoffs and these cutbacks.  Can you explain?  </p><p>DINGELL:  Well, I will say that people's reaction has been in the  delegation meeting with Michigan delegation that Mary Barra had, it wasn't  me that said that, it was several members on both sides of the aisle that  told her she had managed to unite everybody in their -- you know, dislike  and frustration.  </p><p>Look, this is a serious time.  I've been warning my colleagues here for a  year that this is a cyclical industry and you were going to see a softening  at some point.  But you're also seeing a transformation of the auto  industry.  I had some pretty strong feelings that week, still do, because I  think people were not expecting these announcements the way that they were  handled, upset people, and clearly -- look, I'm a car girl and I'm very  proud of it, it's where I come from.  But I want to keep manufacturing in  this country.  I'm tired of it going overseas.  And a lot of people are  concerned about what we need to do and what this government needs to do to  help keep manufacturing in the U.S.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Dingell, it's Dagen McDowell.  On that note with  the renegotiated NAFTA, it will be up to Congress to pass it.  It is  designed to keep jobs here in the United States, particularly auto jobs.   So on that note, would you -- are you planning to vote in favor of it?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I've not made a decision.  I have talked to Ambassador Lighthizer  multiple times.  I've made it very clear -- you know, we still haven't seen  the details of the bill on Capitol Hill.  He knows how strongly I feel that  I am not going to vote for a bill that keeps letting General Motors move  production.  They announced in July that they were taking the blazer there.   I sent him a tape that I was given by some people, a ground-breaking in  Mexico just last week on a new plant.  </p><p>So I want to make sure and we're going to have to make sure that the  enacting legislation is going to keep jobs here.  There are a number --  there are issues that we have with the bill that we're hearing about it.  I  know that this White House is hoping I will support it.  If I can keep jobs  in the United States of America I'll support it.  I'm not there yet.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Congresswoman, G.M. needed a bailout  because they ran a business very poorly.  It seems to me like they're now  running a business profitably and now the politicians don't like the fact  they're running this profitably.  It seems to me that this is flying  absolutely 100 percent in the face of the free markets, exactly opposite of  what America stands for with you guys interfering in a private business.  </p><p>DINGELL:  So, I don't believe in government interfering with private  business.  And I knew -- I know that there are people out there saying that  we're interfering in their production plants, but we do have a lot of  questions.  </p><p>Know, on the same day that General Motors made that announcement, Ford  Motor Company called me.  I talked to them all of the time.  And by the  way, so does the Japanese government talk to its people, the Chinese  government.  There should be a good relationship so that we are supporting.  </p><p>But Ford took a shift out of a plant that's flat rock, it's where they  produced the mustang.  But they didn't -- you didn't hear about it publicly  for several days.  They talked to every employee that was going to be  impacted by that shift change and they're finding other places for them to  work in the immediate area.  </p><p>So, even the way that they announced it.  They've got to make tough  decisions.  They've got to transform them themselves where I want the  United States to stay at the forefront of transportation mobility.  I don't  want it happening in China or India or Western Europe.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Are you sure you want to quote a Chinese communist government on  how to handle business?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I'm not quoting the Chinese government.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  You just did.  </p><p>DINGELL:  I didn't say that.  I said I don't want it built in China.  I  don't want it built and I said all of those governments support.  You know,  if an American company goes to China, they have to invest with a Chinese  partner there.  Our government needs to support our American companies so  they locate jobs here and we create jobs here in America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, you sound like President Trump.  Let me ask you -- </p><p>DINGELL:  Well, I have said that I will work with anybody, if I'm going to  help the American worker here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's good, that's what the American people want to hear.  Let  me ask you your thought on trades and tariffs, congresswoman.  What is the  effect of the steel and aluminum tariffs on your home state of Michigan?   We worry and there's a lot of worry that the economy is slowing down as a  result of these higher costs.  </p><p>DINGELL:  You know, one of my problems with the way that President Trump  has done his trade policy is that you're not really sure what it is.   Businesses need consistency and that's one of the things that we don't  have.  We have too much chaos.  Obviously these aluminum steel tariffs are  having an impact.  I've been talking to the companies.  I've been talking  to the supplier industry.  I've been talking to a lot of people, U.S. care  on a regular basis.  And I know that they know that we've got to deal with  this issue.  So, I am concerned about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you want the tariffs to go away?  </p><p>DINGELL:  Look, I got to tell you, I have an empty steel plant that sat on  the river of my district for 25 years.  So, I know that we do not have a  level playing field.  I want a level playing field and I want consistency.   I want a stable policy --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the steelworkers are happy about the steel tariffs.  </p><p>DINGELL:  They are very happy about because they've got empty --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, are you happy about the steel tariffs?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I know that it's having an impact.  And I know that there is --  the way that it's being done right now is not having a positive impact on  the businesses that could potentially impact the workers.  I also know that  we've got too many empty steel plants and too many empty plants in this  country because of our lack of a good, strong policy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's both, you're talking on both sides of the issue.  </p><p>DINGELL:  No, I'm not talking on both sides (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the steelworkers want the steel tariffs.  They feel  they've just got another lease on life because of the steel tariffs.   They're happy about it.  The companies that are paying those tariffs, the  companies that are seeing their input costs are upset about it.  Where do  you sit?  </p><p>DINGELL:  So, if you talk to Ford Motor Company or you talk to some of the  other companies, so same companies that oppose TPP, I might also add, that  the way that this has been implemented has been chaotic.  And if we get a - - it has been chaotic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What ways has it been implemented?  What do you mean?</p><p>DINGELL:  It's been chaotic.  You don't know what the president's plans  are.  You don't know how --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know what the president's plans are, he's putting  tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  </p><p>DINGELL:  It has not been in a consistent way.  The businesses need  consistency.  But I am going to tell you that I think this government needs  to support American companies the way the Japanese support those companies.  </p><p>And we need to do some things too, like putting some quality standards in  there.  Some of the steel that we've been getting from Japan has not been  at the same quality and we're seeing some damage because of that too.  I  might also add on the side.  </p><p>BELL:  Congresswoman, getting back to NAFTA, the USMCA agreement, the  Commerce Department is out there saying look, the only way they're going to  back it is if the steel and aluminum tariffs are removed from Mexico and  Canada.  Where do you stand on that issue?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I probably -- I'm listening to all of the discussions.  I am  having discussions with people but I think that is something that we need  to take a very serious look at.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the bottom line, are you going to vote for USMCA?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know.  And I call it NAFTA 2.0 because I want people to  know that the first NAFTA really hurt jobs and screwed the American worker  and I don't want to put a different title on it.  It's NAFTA 2.0. and if  it's going to help the American worker, if it's going to stop jobs going to  Mexico, if I'm going to see another ground-breaking, I'm going to vote for  it.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, will it help or not?  Have you seen it?  I mean,  this --</p><p>DINGELL:  I have not seen the details.  I've had multiple discussions with  many people.  And until we see the details and there are some things in  there that we know are going to take care of it, I'm not committed but I'm  more likely to vote of it than many others.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Are you at least going to read it before you vote on it?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I am somebody who always reads a bill and you can ask my staff.   There's many a night I've stayed up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, good for you, we like that.</p><p>DINGELL:  And you can ask (INAUDIBLE) -- yes, I am -- I don't just do this  willy-nilly.  I want to see jobs stay here.  I know those people.  Those  are people that I have seen and worked with for years.  I know what that  fear and that panic is in that auto worker's heart from what happened in  2018.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think that's probably why a lot of your constituents  voted for Trump.  </p><p>DINGELL:  It is quite.  And by the way, I'm somebody who two years ago said  that President Trump could win because Democrats did a terrible job of  talking to the worker and letting them know that they cared about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how is the president doing now, congresswoman?  </p><p>DINGELL:  He's got some -- you know, he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan and  said he wouldn't let an auto plant close.  Well, we just heard that we're  going to see some plant closings, so we've got some issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, you're going to blame him on the G.M. shutdown?  </p><p>DINGELL:  I have said just for the record, I'd work with him.  So I'm  somebody that doesn't take him --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to work with him on the border funding?  I mean,  we've got a showdown underway right here.  President Trump is meeting with  your colleague House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>DINGELL:  That is correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer later today.  They're  trying to strike a deal on border funding.  The Democrat leaders say they  will offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall.  That's a stark difference from  the $5 billion that the president is requesting.  So bottom line here, do  you want the wall or not?  </p><p>DINGELL:  So I wish the world was as crystal clear as you like to see it.   I think the wall is a stupid idea and I think it's a symbol of division  that we don't need.  I do think that we need to keep our borders safe on  both sides.  People forget about the border that I live on.  But if -- I'm  not -- I don't think compromise is a dirty word.  So let's see what  happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you said it's a stupid idea.  Then what's your security  net.  If it's -- you said it was a stupid idea.  </p><p>DINGELL:  I think that it's more -- do you want to know what's more  effective?  We need more border crossings, we need to use more electronics.   There are documented studies that say we can keep both borders a lot safer  with a lot more advanced technology.  I think all the wall is a symbol of  division or that people are going to be able to get around anyway.  I do  think we need to invest in keeping our border secure.  </p><p>But let's -- the wall has become the symbol of many things, of division,  that many people say isn't going to work.  But we do have technology and we  need more border agents to help keep our borders safe.  National security  matters.  And I'm tired of people trying to say that people like the  Democrats don't want to keep our nation safe.  Every last one of us, number  one -- number one, keeping our nation safe matters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So build a wall.  </p><p>DINGELL:  You said -- I have not -- I have said the compromise isn't a  dirty word.  But go read the studies because there are several.  And I'm  glad given to you because I've stayed up at night reading them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>DINGELL:  Saying that there are ways to keep this nation safer than  building that wall.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, you've got a lot of good ideas.  We hope you  come back soon.  </p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell there.</p><p>Coming up, defense nominating the Seahawks beating the Vikings on \"Monday  Night Football\" last night.  We've got the highlights coming up.  </p><p>And then, one of the NBA's brightest stars with some pretty out-of-this- world thinking, find out what Steph Curry has to say about the moon  landing, that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A controversial play helps the Seahawks win  again.  Jared Max with all the \"Monday Night Football\" highlights.  Hi,  Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Should  there have been a 15-yard penalty, this is the question that remains.   Fourth quarter, Vikings trail the Seahawks, 6-0.  Seattle's Bobby Wagner,  watch, he uses the shoulders of a teammate to help him leap over the line  of scrimmage to block the field goal.  Should have been a 15-yard penalty  but the Vikings denied.  Few plays later, Seahawks scored touchdown.  And  18 seconds after this happens, strip sack of Kirk Cousins.  Cousins yells  uncle, Vikings lose 21-7.  Seattle won four straight, Russell Wilson a  career low, 72 passing yards.  </p><p>All right, the next time Golden State Warrior star Steph Curry meets with  reporters, the pressing questions likely won't be about what Steph did last  night on the court but rather something he said in a podcast.  Steph scored  38 last night, seven of 14 from three point range.  The Warriors win by  eight against Minnesota.  What will Steph Curry get asked about?  This  comment, made on the podcast, winging it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN CURRY, NBA BASKETBALL PLAYER, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS:  We ever been  to the moon?  </p><p>UNIDENTFIED MALE:  No.  </p><p>CURRY:  They're going to come get us.  I don't think so either.  Sorry, I  don't want to start conspiracies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Have you ever been to the moon?  Steph, NASA says we would love for  Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston.  We  have hundreds of pounds of moon rock stored there.  He can see that  firsthand what we did 50 years ago.  Maria, Steph Curry says we didn't land  on the moon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say about that.  I mean -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  You could see footprints on the moon from the astronauts with a  telescope.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, thank you, Jared.  We want to get to this tweet that the  president just posted.  President Trump is just tweeting on the border  wall.  Here's what the president just said.  Despite the large caravans  that were forming and heading to our country, people have not been able to  get through our newly built walls, make shift walls and fences or border  patrol officers and military.  They are now staying in Mexico or going back  to their original countries.  ICE, border patrol and our military have done  a fantastic job of securing our southern border, writes the president.  </p><p>The president says a great wall would be however a far easier and less  expensive solution.  We have already built large new sections and fully  renovated others making them like new.  The Democrats, however, for  strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left,  do not want border security.  They want open borders for anyone to come in.   This brings large scale crime and disease.  Our southern border is now  secure and will remain that way.  </p><p>The president writes I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer and  Nancy Pelosi.  In 2006, Democrats voted for a wall and they were right to  do so.  Today, they no longer want border security.  They will fight it at  all cost and Nancy must get votes for speaker.  But the wall will get  built.  </p><p>The president goes on to say, people do not yet realize how much of the  wall including really effective renovation has already been built.  If the  Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will  bring the remaining sections of the wall.  They know how important it is,  says the president.  That was a long tweet.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it is the most wonderful time of the year but also the  most expensive.  15 percent of Americans are still paying off last year's  holiday debt which averaged $1,054.  Joining us right now is Ramsey  Solutions financial expert and author of the upcoming book, Everyday  Millionaires, Chris Hogan.  Chris, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY'S SOLUTION:  Well, thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we all want to buy presents this holiday.  What are some of  the ways we can save and not get too far into debt, Chris?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, Maria, the most important thing is to remain in control.  You  know, you don't want to let the holidays make you crazy.  So stay in  control.  </p><p>So, I've got four tips for people.  Number one, tally up what you've spent  so far.  A lot of people have been shopping throughout the year for  Christmas.  So be aware of what you've already bought, what you've already  spent.  I really want you to stay focused and stick to your budget.  This  is where you assign a dollar amount of how much you're going to spend and  who you're going to afford to shop for.  </p><p>The next tip is use cash.  Cash will help you remain in control.  And it  helps you to understand your limits.  If you're going to spend $100 on your  brother for Christmas, when that $100 is gone, you stop.  </p><p>The next tip is avoid the store credit cards.  These things are sneaky,  Maria, and they're a thief.  I mean,  it's amazing that they'll offer you  10 percent off that day, but charge you 24 percent every other day.  So  avoid that.  </p><p>And then finally, 22 percent of Americans buy gifts for themselves when  they're shopping for others.  So don't buy for yourself every time you go  out shopping.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can't not do that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I always buy myself a gift.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris, with your perfect voice, it's Dagen, I just want you to  sing the following line, you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  Because you're  Grinching on the holiday, Chris.  I want to buy myself some socks.</p><p>HOGAN:  No, Dagen, I am not doing that.  No, I'm not singing.  But here's  the thing.  Credit card debt -- Credit card debt is a Grinch.  Credit card  debt is the thing that will steal your joy and it will cause you to be --  you know, trying to pay off Christmas for two to three holidays from now.   So just take a deep breath and understand the real reason for the season.   It's about family.  It's about friends.  It's not about how much you spend.   It's not how much you buy for yourself.  So let's go into this holiday with  clarity.  Be aware, remain in control, and don't bring debt into your life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, and you can't blame us for trying.  You have an  incredible voice, Chris.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, maybe the next time I'm in studio I'll sing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can't get enough of your love, babe.  Chris, thank you, Chris  Hogan.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, Google on the hot seat, Sundar Pichai going before  Congress later this morning.

And the NASDAQ up  1.1 percent, that's 76 points higher right now as we speak after a wild  session yesterday.  Markets bounce off of the low and actually ended the  day in positive territory, but man was it hard getting there.  The Dow  Industrials when all was set and done was up 34 points, fractional gains  percentage wise.</p><p>S&amp;P was up four points and the NASDAQ was up 51 points yesterday.  Three- quarters of a percent higher.  But it had been down sharply.  In fact, the  Dow was down better than 500 points at its low after British Prime Minister  Theresa May announced that she was delaying the vote on the deal to exit  the European Union.  Then, markets started clawing their way back up.  Her  spokesperson this morning tells Fox Business that the vote will take place  before January 21st.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also higher.  Take a look at European  indices, FT-100 up 106 points, 1-1/2 percent higher.  The CAC quarante in  Paris is up almost two percent right now.  92 points higher.  And the DAX  Index also up almost two percent, 202 points higher in Germany.  In Asia  overnight, markets were little changed as you can see there.  Meanwhile,  one reason for the bounce this morning, trade talks are moving forward with  China.</p><p>The U.S. and China held a new round of negotiations last night on the  phone.  We will have the very latest on what went on.  Coming together  meanwhile, President Trump is set to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy  Pelosi and the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer over the funding for  the border wall.  That is among the top items on the agenda, Democrats  reportedly ready to offer $1.3 billion for the wall.  That, of course, is  short of the President's $5 billion requests.</p><p>Plus this, Google's turn on the hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai is  headed to Capitol Hill this morning.  He will testify before the House  Judiciary Committee.  Fox Business will bring you that live, 10:00 a.m.  Eastern.  We're taking a look at what to expect from his testimony when I  speak with Congressman Jim Jordan, he's on Judiciary.  He's coming up.</p><p>And then Delta says no to kittens and puppies.  Really?  The details on the  new emotional support rules at Delta Airlines.  Oh, look how cute that is.   All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  Contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happily surprised that European  markets are up after all the Brexit talks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Big rally underway.  Maybe initially the markets  turned when she said she was delaying the vote but then by the end of her  speech the markets started rallying.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think the market is a thing that she could get a no-confidence  vote and he could have a new referendum and that would be the -- probably  the best thing for the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And a new prime minister.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  Definitely.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  You know --</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Hopefully it's not Jeremy Corbyn.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could Be Boris Johnson.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  He got a new haircut.  He did.  He even got (INAUDIBLE) on the  morning thug shows and the rumor is he got that the new look to try to  become the new prime minister.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh wow.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I think it just goes  to show that the cracks that are in the European Union, we likely discussed  at the top of the show, you know, you've got these guys, we got France  going on there, you've got Italy, there is a lot of question marks on the  distance --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL:  -- going forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's trade and the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve seems  to have -- taken us a step to the side in terms of market worries and now  trade as talks get under way.  The messaging here is critical out of the  White House.  We'll see how they do that in the next 90 days,</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We got a lot coming up this morning.  Joining the  conversation, House Judiciary Committee member and Ohio Congressman Jim  Jordan is with us this morning along with Motorola Solutions chairman and  CEO Greg Brown who has totally turn that company around.  Former member of  British parliament John Brown is here and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big  hour coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off right here with this top story and that is the shutdown  showdown.  President Trump is gearing up for a meeting today with  Democratic Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.  This is an effort to  strike a deal on border funding ahead of the looming government shutdown.  Blake Burman is live right now at the White House with the very latest.   Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you.  Here we go again.  President Trump wants $5 billion more for his  border wall.  Democrats aren't willing to get anywhere near that number and  there's got to be some sort of a compromise by December 21st or else there  will be a partial government shutdown and that include the Department of  Homeland Security.</p><p>We will get a much better idea later today as to where things stand as  President Trump is set to meet this morning with Chuck Schumer and Nancy  Pelosi 11:30 here at the White House.  And a series of tweets this morning  the President continue to vouch for the wall and even floated a new idea at  one-point writing \"I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer and  Nancy Pelosi\".</p><p>In 2006, Democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so.  He then  went on to propose the following \"if the Democrats do not give us the votes  to secure our country, the military will rebuild the remaining sections of  the wall, they know how important it is.  That was just snippets of five  different tweets that he sent out.  In a joint statement ahead of this  meeting, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi put the onus on Republicans to make  sure that there is not a government shutdown.</p><p>Saying in their statement \"our country cannot afford a Trump shut  especially at the time of economic uncertainty, this holiday season the  President knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to  pass the House and Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan  agreement.  Maria threats about a government shutdown, nothing new in  Washington with that and certainly nothing new in the Trump presidency with  that.</p><p>The different dynamics this time around is that Democrats take control of  the House in about three to four weeks' time, meaning that the moment could  be now for the President to get as much as he can on the border wall.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All-important points you make.  Blake, thank you.  Blake  Burman joining us there at the White House.  Joining me right now is Ohio  Congressman House Judiciary Committee member and Freedom Caucus member Jim  Jordan.  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much  for joining me.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  Good to be with you.  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You and Congressman Mark Meadows published an op-ed for Fox  News this morning titled, Build the Wall -- do what we said we'd do, and it  reads in part, Democrats do not want to bring attention to their extremist  positions on immigration.  Therefore, open borders and abolishing  immigration and customs enforcement, securing the border is not going to  happen in a Pelosi-run Congress.</p><p>We still have three weeks, that's more than enough time to do what we said.   And my question, Congressman is, can the President get this funding with  Republicans?  Because it is not just the Democrats who are pushing back on  this, the Republicans refuse to get behind the President's request and this  has been going on for a year, Congressman.  </p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.  No.  There are Republicans votes for this.  The problem is  Chuck Schumer in the Senate and the 60-vote rule they have over there which  is ridiculous, so there are Republican votes to build the border security  wall and deal with the asylum law changes that we have to have to address  the caravan issue.  That's the position the Freedom Caucus has taken, more  importantly, that's the position of the American people.</p><p>And frankly what we were elected to do in 2016.  So this is common sense,  five billion for the wall, change the asylum law so we can deal with this  caravan issue, this catch and release issue.  Let's do those things there,  good common sense.  Let's get them done.  The problem is Chuck Schumer and  he talks a lot about a shutdown, Maria.  Remember, there's been one  shutdown this year and guess who did it, Chuck Schumer on a short-term  spending bill back in February when he shut the government down over the  weekend and he said, amnesty was more important than funding the troops and  funding the government.</p><p>So if you're going to talk about shutdown, the only one who's done that  thus far is Chuck Schumer.  So let's just do what we said and get the thing  done.  That's where the American people are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  No, you're right about that.  So what happens today  when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say to the President, look, all we have  is $1.3 billion and that's it.  And we don't want DACA attached to this, we  don't want anything else -- I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi is trying to get her  speaker votes in order, right?  And that's not happening until January.   So, why is she going to vote -- why is she going to do anything?  She  doesn't want to rock the boat before she gets the speakership, right?  </p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.  I think we just -- again, just do what we said put the five  billion on the must-pass spending bill, put the asylum reform language on  there and go have the debate with the American people and say if Chuck  Schumer doesn't want to support this, if he really wants a shutdown, if the  Democrats really don't want to do these common sense things, that's on  them, let's -- after all, excuse me, after all they're the only ones who  shut the government down.</p><p>I think you just got to have the debate and frankly not be afraid of having  the debate.  Let's actually have it, let's say, here are the two positions,  American people you decide.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think the Republicans will be there?  </p><p>JORDAN:  I do, and I hope so.  I think I know the President is there, I  know the Freedom Caucus is there, I hope we'll stand firm on that position.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the Freedom Caucus is calling for two amendments to the  funding bill including funding for the border wall and ending catch and  release policies.  Tell us about this because most people don't understand  when an illegal comes here and the U.S. catches them, they have to release  them and then get a court date in the calendar and they may or may not show  up.  So, then they're in the country illegally, probably taking others'  jobs, creating a lot of expense for the U.S. </p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.  And it's even worse than that.  DHS and ICE will tell you  that 85 percent of the individuals who show up at the border and actually  claim asylum, 85 percent of them aren't legitimate asylum seekers.  So  that's why we need more judges on the border, we need to deal with this  right away, not let them come to the country, get in the country, release  them and then they never show up for their hearing.</p><p>So let's have the hearing right away.  In fact, the President is working on  this.  He's working on making sure they stay in Mexico before they come in  the country and you can actually adjudicate and figure out everything then,  have the hearing then before they come in.  If they're legitimate, they're  running and fleeing something, that serious then understand and so we want  to let them in the country but we want to be able to vet them, check them  out.</p><p>Again, that is just good common sense.  And it's so contrary to where the  Democrats are.  Remember in 2016, the leader of their party said she wanted  a borderless hemisphere.  They're the ones who said they want to abolish  ICE.  So those are the two choices it seems to us our position is pretty  darn common sense, let's do the common-sense thing and let's stand firm for  it.  Actually, I think our voters appreciate that the American people  appreciate that when you stand firm and do the right thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I agree with that.  I got to get to Google but first, your  take on the Jim Comey testimony where he said, I don't know, I don't  remember I don't recall 245 times.  What are you going to get done in your  new Congress number one because now you've got a different position in the  new Congress and what happens when the Democrats shut this all down which  you know that's coming?</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.  It will be harder obviously in the new Congress but we still  have this Congress.  We need Rod Rosenstein to come in and testify.  It's  now been 12 weeks since he talked to subordinates about wearing a wire to  record the President and talking about invoking the 25th amendment.  So we  need --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you know that's not going to a happen.  Look, Paul Ryan had  a shot and he let it go, OK?  </p><p>JORDAN:  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  I think it might still happen because Mark Meadows -- Matt Gaetz  and I are continuing to push for that.  So I think there's a chance that it  does happen and frankly, it should happen and we need him to come in and  answer those questions.  As far as Jim Comey goes, he didn't know the first  thing about Christopher Steele.  The guy whose work product was the basis  for getting the FISA to spy on the Trump campaign.  So he didn't -- he  never knew Chris Steele, never talked to him.  Didn't know he was working  with Bruce Ohr, the top Justice Department official.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.</p><p>JORDAN:  Didn't know that Bruce Ohr was hacking information to the FBI.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there ever going to be any accountability here, Congressman?   Any accountability for those who try to put their finger on the scale in  the 2061 election.  We all know what went on.  </p><p>JORDAN:  We're pushing for it but I will say -- tell you this, Comey has  been fired, Deputy Director Andy McCabe fired, Jim Baker chief counsel of  the FBI was demoted, then last, Lisa Page, FBI counsel demoted then left  and Peter Strzok, deputy head of counterintelligence was demoted then  fired.  So these are the top people.  I've never seen that happened before.   Andy McCabe maybe facing some criminal liability as well.</p><p>So we'll see how this shakes out.  We can't put anyone in -- we can't  prosecute anyone, we can only get the answers for the American people and  that's what we're trying to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's a good point that you make because without the  Republicans and you and your colleagues pushing all of this, Devin Nunes as  well in the House, we would not know any of this.  All right.  Real quick,  Google on the hot seat, CEO Sundar Pichai set to appear before your  committee later this morning.  He's expected to answer questions on the  company's business practices, handling of user data, potential political  bias.  What are you expecting, what do you want to hear?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, a couple things.  Remember 3.5 billion searches a day.  And  if a company like Google is biased and limiting certain points of view,  that's a big problem.  So that's the issue, that's the fundamental issue  that we need to explore and find out.  Are they really limiting point of  views?  It seems that they are, it seems like it typically is conservative  points of view.  So that's sort of the focus.  When you have a company with  this clout, this much influence, this much power over the flow of  information and potentially then the impact that can have on the electoral  process, that's pretty darn serious and that's going to be the focus of the  hearing.</p><p>Is there bias there?  It sure looks like it, let's explore that.  And if  you're not willing to change things, and actually be a neutral platform  like you portray yourself to be, then the Congress may have to take some  action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you said what?  3.5 billion searches a day?  Is that  what you said?</p><p>JORDAN:  3.5 billion searches a day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know Google has 90 percent mortgage here.  Real quick before  you go, Congressman.  Do you want to see regulation -- new regulation on  these companies, these social media companies?  Who are media companies?</p><p>JORDAN:  I think it depends on what to learn but what we want is neutrality  that the law gives them all kinds of protections if there are neutral  social media platform if there are a neutral platform.  If they're not,  then you may have to treat them like a publisher, you may have to treat  them like a newspaper.  And frankly you may have to also look at, do we  have to break these companies -- these companies up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  All right.  We're going to be watching that.   Congressman, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>JORDAN:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jim Jordan there.  Stay with us for FBN live coverage of Google  CEO testimony before Congress at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We're going to take  you there live.  But first, new negotiations.  Details as American and  Chinese officials kick off a fresh round of talks last night.  Stay with  us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tesla announcing plans to open nearly a dozen  new dealerships in U.S. next year.  Cheryl Casone, with details there.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, change of  direction here, Maria.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, tweeted out this morning,  \"We're opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including  Knoxville.  Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.\"</p><p>Tesla moving to expand its retail presence by focusing on locations inside  malls where shoppers can, of course, check out its cars in person.  Musk,  who was born in South Africa, adding Tesla could open its first store in  South Africa by the end of 2019.</p><p>Shares of Tesla higher ahead of the opening bell up more than 1-1/2 percent  right now.  Excuse me.</p><p>Well, Delta has making changes to its animal policy.  The airline banning  all emotional support animals, on flights that are longer than eight hours.   It's also prohibiting all animals under four months old -- think puppies,  kittens, no matter how long flight.  The policy goes in effect on December  18th.</p><p>Delta, says the changes were made because of a big increase in incidents  involving animals.  Take a look at the stock, Delta is up slightly, ear-to- take.</p><p>OK, the Trump administration wants to deliver much-needed revenue to the  Postal Service.  It's proposing selling access to your mailbox to private  companies.  It is illegal for anyone except the Postal Service mail carrier  to deliver to a mailbox that makes the mailboxes as highly valuable assets.</p><p>Well, the new report says the Postal Service could generate significant  revenue by selling mailbox access to companies like FedEx, UPS, et cetera.   Postal Service recently reported a net loss of $3.9 billion in the fiscal  year that ended in September.</p><p>And Post Malone and Crocs are teaming up again on a new shoe.  This is big.   You are looking at the Post Malone X Crocs Barbed Wire Clog.  Which goes on  sale today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time for about 60 bucks.  The barbed wire  design mimics the tattoo of it's on Post Malone's forehead.</p><p>The first collaboration between Crocs and the rapper sold out in less than  a day.  When that shoe they be, that was just last month.  Taking a look at  shares, of Crocs, they had nearly doubled so far this year.</p><p>Maybe somebody has something to say about Delta on the panel, but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fear headlines.</p><p>CASONE:  We all do.  We all do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, yes.  I just -- I can.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's wrong puppies and kittens?  What?  Excuse me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Puppies and kittens are problem, but not the 300-pound sweaty  guys sitting next to me with shoes off, who can't get even put the armrest  down.  Whose chewing gum and eating Cheetos at the same time.  And then,  rubbing the Cheeto residue all over the edge of my seat.  He's fine.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Puppies and kittens.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But puppies and kittens really stink.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what it's about?  It's about money because when you put  bringing animals on a plane and put them under the seat, in a carrier, they  charge you.  I think its $250 round-trip for a puppy or kitten or any small  dog.  That's why it is about revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, I'd like some answers from Delta.  What's wrong  with puppies and kittens?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  This is a horrible decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrible.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Horrible.  I won't give my cat a fake I.D. to get only kids,  take him under 4-months old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, if you can put -- you can put him in a crate.  You can put  him in a crate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Puppies and kittens.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can put them in a crate.  You just can't put them in your  lap.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But a sweaty guy with the shoes off, he's OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, why would I want barbed wire on my shoes?  I  mean, I'm saying -- all right, quick break.  A new round of trade talks  occurred last night.  The details as the U.S. and Chinese officials discuss  changes to Beijing's economic policies.  Wait until you hear this.</p><p>Stay with us for an exclusive c-suite reaction from Motorola Solutions  chairman and CEO Greg Brown.  That's next.  And then, the best places to  work.  We'll tell you the company that took the top spot.  Coming up.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  China trade negotiations.  The U.S. and China  kicked off a new round of trade talks last night.  Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and their  Chinese counterparts talked on the phone.  President Trump just tweeted  about the talks moments ago.  He says this, \"Very productive conversations  going on with China.  Watch for some important announcements.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is a gentleman whose company operated in China for a  long time.  Fox Business exclusive right now.  Motorola Solutions chairman  and CEO Greg Brown.  And Greg, it's great to see this morning.</p><p>GREG BROWN, CHAIRMAN, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And you know it's  interesting because Motorola was one of the first companies in Europe in  China.</p><p>BROWN:  We were.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got a real story here.  Nixon was on a Motorola  phone.  You had a Huawei executive arrested years ago.  So, I want you to  take us back to how Motorola has operated in China, and what your history  is with China, sure.</p><p>BROWN:  It so, as you mentioned, President Nixon in 1972 when he first  visited the country spoke on a Motorola provided satellite phone.   Subsequently, Bob Galvin led a delegation in 1986.  And the following year,  Motorola was one of the very first U.S. multinationals in the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, then, what happened?</p><p>BROWN:  Things boomed, it was great.  China ascended into the WTO.  If you  think about the Motorola firsts in China, Motorola built the largest at the  time, contiguous cellular network in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BROWN:  It offered the first mobile phone with Chinese characters.  It had  the first Chinese mobile phone with GPS.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you have to transfer all your technology over to the  Chinese?</p><p>BROWN:  Not at that point.  Not at that point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, then, what happened?</p><p>BROWN:  So, then things progressed, and I think the whole environment  changed -- started to change about a decade ago.  It's well publicized in  2007, a Huawei actually was a Motorola engineer who was arrested at O'Hare  Airport with a one-way ticket to China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BROWN:  $30,000 in cash, a thousand thumb drives.  And what we found was  Huawei was stealing trade secret and confidential files from Motorola with  Chinese nationals that were our employees.  That was subsequently settled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you know for a fact that China was using Huawei as a tool  to steal secrets from Motorola.</p><p>BROWN:  Huawei definitely stole trade secrets from Huawei.  And we sued,  Maria, but we subsequently settled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, continue.</p><p>BROWN:  So, then you fast forward to now and I think it's a very different  environment.  Market access is tough.  If you want to compete in China, you  have to usually -- if not oftentimes turn over your intellectual property  to a local alliance, they use indigenous standards for cellular as  something called TD-SCDMA.  In our world for Motorola for policing, it's  called police digital trucking.</p><p>So, quite frankly, we made the decision, I made the decision about eight  years ago to essentially get out of China.  In the sense of no  manufacturing, no R&amp;D, I think it's a good market to serve.  It's OK.  It's  vast.  We'll do so on terms that conducive -- that are conducive to us.</p><p>But lastly, just a couple of statistics.  At the height of Motorola in  China about 15 years ago, we were over $3 billion in revenue and 15,000  people.  Today, we're a $170 million of revenue with 170,000 people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BROWN:  So, it's a different game.  We're competing.  We're moving forward  with a mission, critical communications.  Video surveillance, and  analytics.  And we want to be and we are the Western alternative to non- Chinese electronic content.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p>BROWN:  Here we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And here we are, where you got into this company and completely  lifted the growth.  I mean, you're just coming off of a sixth-quarter of  impressive results.  This formidable niche that you have been able to  create in this space.  Tell me how is it going?  You've also acquired seven  companies spent $3 billion on those deals since 2015.</p><p>Mostly new software programs.  Where does the growth come from now at the  company and what led this growth over your tenure?</p><p>BROWN:  Well, I think we pivoted more toward a services and software  orientation, number one.  Number two, we have I think the best employees in  the industry.  Strongest team I've ever had.  We've taken advantage of some  of the corporate tax reform and use that capital for aggressive  acquisitions.</p><p>But here's the interesting thing with us.  We're not just the radio  communications provider anymore.  We do the mission-critical communications  that are so vital to secure communities, secure the border, protect the  military.</p><p>We're also the leader in integrated command center software.  So, you think  about all these dispatchers in America at 6,000 locations.  Taking calls on  a headsets for 911 call handling.  CAD dispatch of first responders,  evidence management, and then, you think of the proliferation of video.</p><p>And we spend a billion dollars on a leading provider of video surveillance  and analytics.  Here is the cool part.  It's not just the camera.  It's an  intelligent edge device with video storage, with video management, with  machine learning video analytics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BROWN:  So, now we are comprehensive mission-critical communication and  video surveillance company, and we are booming.  We've had eight  consecutive quarters of organic growth, record backlog, the U.S. economy is  the anchor tenant that's driving growth.  And I think we're very well- positioned going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it apparently.  And you've got this great backlog in  terms of driving growth in the next five years.</p><p>BROWN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you about the consumer today.  I mean, and  business spending.</p><p>BROWN:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were having a debate earlier in terms of business spending.   And are we seeing capital expenditures stay up there?  What's your view of  the economy right now, and are you expecting things to slow down in the  coming couple of years?</p><p>BROWN:  We're not expecting it to slow down as we think about 2019.  Two- thirds of Motorola's revenue are North America, we are increasing hiring,  we are increasing capital spending because we see the growths opportunities  live more at the capital allocation and deployment.  I think that growth  internationally in the other theatres might be more be a little bit more  tempered, maybe in '19.  FX headwinds maybe a little bit greater.  But at  the end of the day, given what we do, which is mission critical public  safety, it's a need to have, not a nice to have, so I think we have some  indifference to some of those international markets that we can weather  through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are just getting the Producer Price Index out, the PPI is up  one-tenth of a percent for the month of November.  We were expecting it to  be unchanged.  This idea that input costs are going up for business.  What  are you seeing?</p><p>BROWN:  I see very modestly and manageably.  So, I think if we take input  costs and overlay, our conversation with China and the tariffs, we expect  tariffs increases in 2019 to be about 8 to 10 million.  So, we can moderate  it, it's incorporated into the business plan.  I think the input costs can  be managed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not worried about steel and aluminum tariffs cutting  into this strength that you have?</p><p>BROWN:  No, I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, the way you have turned this company around and  led -- you gave those stats at the beginning of the -- of the interview in  terms of revenue today, number of employees today.  Where do you go from  here?  Where does the growth come from now?</p><p>BROWN:  Well, we are in a huge addressable market.  So, if you think about  video surveillance and analytics, we're 4 to 500 million revenue a year in  a $12-billion market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big runway.</p><p>BROWN:  Huge runway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big runway.</p><p>BROWN:  Our software revenue is about 400 million, in a command center  software addressable market of 5 billion plus.  So, the market is there,  our brand and domain expertise is there.  I think we have all the tools and  capacity to continue to drive growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the chart looks good, the stock is obviously trading up,  has been for the entire last couple of years.  In terms of shareholder- friendly moves, what are you planning in terms of stock buybacks, dividend  increases, et cetera?</p><p>BROWN:  Well, I think we've been very disciplined in capital allocation if  you think about it.  So, historically, in last several years might of my  tenure, we deployed 12-1/2 billion of share buyback at a price of 58 and  change.  We've now spent more contemporarily --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  58 and change.</p><p>BROWN:  -- 3 billion on acquisitions.  So, we're investing organically, in  prioritized R&amp;D with these markets that warrant a fantastic return, and  we'll be surgical in acquisitions that make sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you don't need to be in China.</p><p>BROWN:  No, we don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Greg, it's great to see you.</p><p>BROWN:  Maria, thanks very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations!  Greg Brown joining us there, CEO of Motorola  Solutions.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th.   Your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p>Markets are extending gains this morning, Futures indicating a solid rally  at the start of trading this morning, and it is strong, up 276 points right  now for futures, indicating a one percent rally right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 up 30 points, better than one percent higher, NASDAQ  up 98 points, that's 1-1/2 percent higher on the NASDAQ right now, </p><p>Similar story in Europe, we've got gains across the board.  Take a look at  the European indices with the FT-100 up two percent, 127 points higher on  the FT.  101 points higher on the CAC Quarante, that's better than two  percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 228 points, 2.15 percent higher  in Germany.  Little action in Asian markets overnight, as you can see, it  was a flat session overall and it was mixed.</p><p>President Trump has been tweeting this morning.  He just tweeted on his  Chief of Staff position, he says this, \"Fake news has it purposely wrong.   Many, over 10, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff  position.  Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful  jobs in Washington.  Please report news correctly.\" says the President,  \"Thank you.\"</p><p>Plus, Apple hitting the sales ban on older phones in China, the fallout for  the company coming up, this morning.  Apple shares are up 1-1/3 percent  right now.  And then, there's this, the bests of the bests, the list of the  top large companies to work for.  That list will be revealed this morning.   Time Magazine announcing its \"Person of the Year\" for 2018.  We will tell  you who Time chose.  That's also coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, pushing to save the U.K. exit  deal, Prime Minister Theresa May taking a trip across Europe postponing  today's scheduled vote on Britain leaving the European Union.  Ashley  Webster has been live in London this week.  He's got the very latest from  the ground.  Ashley, good morning to you.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, good morning to you,  Maria.  It was supposed to be the day today, the day the voted on Theresa  May's deal, instead, the U.K. Prime Minister is off on a frantic round of  diplomacy today, heading from one European capital to the other, hoping to  persuade E.U. leaders to provide some concessions to her Brexit deal.   Earlier this morning, she had breakfast with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark  Rutte, they apparently had useful dialogue.  We understand what that means,  nobody knows.  </p><p>She then went on to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   There was a bit of an embarrassing moment when Mrs. May's car showed up and  was to be greeted by Angela Merkel and she couldn't get out of the car, the  door was locked (AUDIO GAP) to unlock it.  Embarrassing but perhaps an  interesting analogy of her being trapped in her own Brexit deal right now.  </p><p>And then later on today, she'll be heading to Brussels to meet with the  President of the European Council Jean-Claude Juncker.  Now, Juncker  himself spoke to the E.U. parliament earlier today in Strasbourg, France  and said very clearly that there is no renegotiating Mrs. May's Brexit  deal.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COUNCIL:  We have achieved is the  best deal possible, it's the only deal possible.  No room whatsoever for  renegotiation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WEBSTER:  No deal whatsoever, I think that's pretty clear as you can make  it.  We understand that the -- whatever deal that Mrs. May gets, she says  it will be voted on back here in the Houses of Parliament before January  21st.  And the clock is ticking, Maria, time running out.  They have until  March 29th to try and figure something out before the U.K. gets out of the  European Union, and it could indeed look more and more like a hard Brexit.  </p><p>Having said that, the sharks are circling around her job as well.  Tory  MPs, more MPs we understand have submitted letters calling for a vote of  confidence in her, as the Conservative Party leader and then Jeremy Corbyn,  leader of the opposition Labour Party is under pressure to call a vote of  no confidence in the government.  That hasn't happened yet, but certainly,  Mrs. May under the gun, doing her best to come back from Europe with  something, but at this point, it doesn't look like she's going to be able  to achieve very much, Maria.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley, thank you so much.  We'll check back as news  develops.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.</p><p>I want to bring in John Browne, he is former member of Britain's  Parliament.  He's also Euro Pacific Capital --</p><p>JOHN BROWNE, FORMER MEMBER OF BRITAIN'S PARLIAMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Senior Economic Consultant.  John, it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.  Let me ask you right out.</p><p>BROWNE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your reaction to what has taken place last 48 hours in  London?</p><p>BROWNE:  Well, it's the most embarrassing situation.  It's -- the world is  laughing at the British circus.  After 13 months of squandered time, we  have no deal.  In fact, we have the deal that's worse than when we started.   It's -- it looks like a joke but it's very, very serious.  And it's very  serious not just for Britain and Europe, but it's a large section of world  trade with the second largest currency in the world, the European Union.   So, if things go bad, it's going to be bad for a lot of the world.  It's a  very serious situation, but it's reached a sort of laughing stock.  </p><p>And I get increasingly suspicious of Prime Minister May.  I thought she was  going to be honest and going for Brexit, but I look at this chaos, and I  have to ask myself, is it just an accident or is it by intent?  It looks to  me now when she comes back with an impossible deal which is worse than when  we started, that in a cricketing term, she's played the ball into the long  grass, which means you -- when you're losing a match, you try to lose the  ball so the match can't continue, and you end up with a draw.  And so, I  think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what are you saying -- what are you saying, John?  Are you  saying she really doesn't in her heart of hearts want to leave -- she  doesn't want to really leave the E.U.?  Do you want to see a different  prime minister in the U.K.?</p><p>BROWNE:  Yes, she was, by her own admission, a remainer, she's a globalist.   She doesn't like Brexit at all.  And I think she's in league with the  European Union to play this thing the long game so that the impossible  situation, and gradually Brexit is renegotiated, negotiated and in fact,  we'll be back where we started but worst off because we won't have a  position on the board.  And of course, I feel like a growing majority of  conservative members of parliament that she must either tender her  resignation or be replaced by the 1922 committee in a vote of conservative  members of parliament.  I think it's becoming urgent because I think she's  doing the country great harm.  This whole journey to Europe, to me, is a  laughing matter, and it's made England look ridiculously and it's very,  very embarrassing and extremely serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  John, what is the most likely outcome going to happen?  I've  heard rumors -- it's John Layfield of New York -- I've heard rumors that  the 48 letters have already been gathered.  They've been gathered for some  time waiting on a no confidence vote to do that the right time.  Are we  going to see -- if we do see a new prime minister, it's going to  (INAUDIBLE) probably be a Conservative Party member?  Are we going to see a  hard Brexit, or is there a chance we're going to see another referendum  because what you have right now as you have articulated is not what 17.4  million Brits voted for to begin with?</p><p>BROWNE:  Exactly.  Now, of course, you could get rid of the prime minister  two ways: one is a vote of confidence in the floor of the House which would  mean the fall of the government and probably, looking at the polls, Jeremy  Corbyn is the next prime minister.  Heaven forbid!  But there are much  neater way -- there are much neater ways for the conservative parliament --  members of parliament to vote her out as leader of the party.  And so,  still have a conservative leader.  And hopefully, if that happened, and  probably likely if it happened, it would be a pro Brexit prime minister,  someone like Rees-Mogg or David Davis, or Boris Johnson, someone like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, meanwhile, the economy hangs in the balance.  I mean,  what kind of an impact does this all have on the U.K. economy?</p><p>BROWNE:  Well, it's uncertainty.  Nobody likes uncertainty.  Businesses  can't plan, and financial people have a very bad time, it's depressing on  business and financials.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, thanks much for joining us.  We appreciate your insights.   John Browne.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we've been reporting, Google's CEO Sundar  Pichai is headed to Capitol Hill today where he will be questioned by the  House Judiciary Committee.  Earlier we heard from Jim Jordan on the  committee.  Joining us right now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney with more right now.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, this is -- he is  -- so, Sundar Pichai is one of the world's most powerful people.  Google  knows absolutely everything about you.  And so, when he appears today,  there's obviously questions of privacy.  Google runs Gmail, somebody read  my Gmail, because I got a call from India about a Minor League's medical  problem that I have over the past couple of years.  The callers suggested,  oh, we can fix this.  How did that person get that information?  How  somebody read my Gmail, my personal Gmail.  And I'm not happy about it!   That's a gross invasion of my privacy.  Now, the deal is you get Gmail for  free, free communications, whoop-de-do, but they can sell that information,  and that information is available to third parties, and I don't like it.   And I want to know what they're going to do about it.  I don't know what  you can do about it, but I'm not happy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  And when it comes to censoring political views of conservatives  when it comes to building a search engine in China which is subject to  censorship and surveillance by the Chinese authorities, I think Google has  got a problem.  I think this is a very big deal.  We may get a hint of what  Congress might do to the Googles of this world later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree with you.  These are real issues, and these are  issues that everybody gets touched by, whether it's privacy or the -- or  the censoring of speech, so this is -- this is important.  You think we'll  see more regulation at some point?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, but I don't know what kind of regulation it's going to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we're trying to understand better.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean, the real answer would be real competition, but I don't see  how you get competition for a search engine which has got, what, 80 percent  of the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Google has 90 percent --</p><p>VARNEY:  90 percent.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- of the market for search.  Stu, I know you'll have a lot  more and we're going to come to you and see the hearing, live, happening at  10:00 a.m.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins at the top of the hour right after  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  So, join Stuart and his guests, coming up.  And then,  that is when you will see the hearing where Sundar Pichai is to speak at  10:00 a.m.</p><p>But first, the best places to work, we're revealing which company took the  top spot this year right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Apple hit with a sales ban in China.  Gerri  Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at that and  what's expected to be a strong rally this morning, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  A big turnaround in  sentiment playing off of what we saw yesterday here.  Apple shares also  enjoying, they're bumped up as well after a Chinese court ordered the  iPhone maker to stop selling older model iPhones including the X, the 8,  the 7, and the 6.  Apple saying this in response, \"Qualcomm's effort to ban  our products is another desperate move by a company whose illegal practices  are under investigation by regulators.  The significance of this first I.P.  court decision that seeks to curtail iPhone sales.\"  Meanwhile, Pegatron,  an iPhone assembler is exempted from this.  Interesting Taiwan-based  company.  </p><p>I want to get quickly here to the companies of the best places to work.   Starting with number five, Aflac, HubSpot, T-Mobile, number two, Google,  and this list put up by comparably.  It's a comp Web site.  Google number  two despite the fact that there was a walkout of employees over issues of  sexual harassment.  Numbers one on this list Costco, they say the benefits  for workers at Costco are very good, indeed.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.  So, Costco, the best place to work.  Costco,  followed by Google, T-Mobile, HubSpot, and Aflac.  Thank you so much,  Gerri.  Great list there.  We'll take a short break.  </p><p>Then, when we come back, Time Magazine's \"Person of the Year.\"  We'll  discuss who was the most influential in 2018.  Also, I went to see Bocelli  last night.  I want to tell you all about it.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Well, the list is out, Time  Magazine makes it official, the \"2018 Person of the Year\", the Guardians,  journalist who have been targeted for their work.  There are four covers,  one features Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered Washington Post columnist,  another highlights Maria Ressa, a Philippine journalist.  The third  features two Reuters journalists who were arrested a year ago for their  reporting on Muslims, and the final cover shows the staff of the Capital  Gazette.  Their office, you know, was the target of a shooting earlier this  year.  That is the Time Magazine Person of the Year.  Reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meaningful and it expresses American values.  And the value of  the first amendment, and how journalist to break news, put their lives on  the line very often.  So, I give -- I give kudos to Time for this very  much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, this was a great idea to do this, and they should be  heralded and cherished for their important work.</p><p>Meanwhile, what a night last night.  I know I've been telling you all about  what I did last night.  I went to see Italian songwriter and tenor Andrea  Bocelli perform in New York City.  It was a private concert at the Columbus  Citizens Foundation.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was such a memorable night.  I love Andrea Bocelli.  I took  my sister and next to me is the wife of Andrea Bocelli, Veronica.  The --  and there's Lidia Bastianich, as well, along with myself and my sister.  We  talked about the Andrea Bocelli Foundation which raises money for  underprivileged people.  As the Columbus Foundation brought together the  Andrea Bocelli Foundation.  Thank you to both.  It was fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jealous.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good morning,  ladies.  Thank you so much.  We will see you in a little bit.  Big day  today.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 11th.  Your top stories right now  just before 6:00 a.m. on the EAST COAST.  Stocks are extending gains right  now, we are at the highs of the morning with a big rally underway.  Dow  Industrials set to open up this morning better than a hundred points, the  S&amp;P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 38 points, that's two-thirds of one  percent higher this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a wild day yesterday on Wall Street, markets were volatile, climbing  from the lowest to the end of the day in positive territory.  Big rally  toward the end of the day, taking the market off of the lows.  The Dow had  been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May  delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Then, by the  close, as you can see, markets reversed course.  Up 34 points at the close  on the Dow.  </p><p>Global markets this morning are also seeing a bit of a bounce, take a look  at FT-100 up better than one percent, 69 points higher, CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 71 points, one and a half percent higher, and the DAX Index in  Germany also higher by one and a half percent, that's a hundred and fifty- seven points higher this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets with little  change, as you can see there, very fractional moves and mixed.  Trade talks  are moving forward.  The U.S. and China holding a new round of negotiations  last night.  We have the very latest on where that stands.  </p><p>And coming together, President Trump set to meet with House Minority  Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and funding the border wall among top items on the  agenda, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will go to the White House.   Democrats reportedly ready to offer to $1.3 billion for the wall, but that  is the short of the President's $5 billion request.  Google's turn on the  hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai's headed to Capitol Hill today.  He will  testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  FOX Business will bring you  that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a look at what to expect  from his testimony this morning. </p><p>Then Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit losing its crown as the most  streamed song from the 20th century.  We'll tell you what tune knocked it  off the top spot, all that coming up this morning.  All those stories  coming up.  Joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John Layfield.  It's great to see you  this morning.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BEYOND SPORT GLOBAL AMBASSADOR:   It's great to see you.  Going to be a crazy week.  With the Brexit, its  potential government shutdown, this is going to be nuts. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Nice to see the green though in  the market this morning, really.  Positive reaction to some of this trade  news and especially in Europe, all in the green after yesterday's Brexit. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see how it closes.  The market's volatility has  been just unreal. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  It's a market that's  trading off headlines, that's trading off commentary, from somebody,  anybody, everybody, coming out of the White House, and I think that that's  going to be the case.  Other than the Federal Reserve meeting in the month  of December, that's really the only, like, hardcore piece of news that we  have coming up that we -- that we know about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We talked yesterday about the fact that the President of  France, Macron, has not been seen in the face of all of these riots.  We  did hear from him yesterday, Dagen.  What did do you think? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is pledging tax cuts and minimum wage hikes to placate  protesters, but, again, I want to point out that the -- kind of the kickoff  to these yellow-vest protests was a gas tax hike to push his environmental  agenda, and I think that that is an actually -- it's an honest move because  that is what it does take if you want to broadly reduce emissions and push  an environmentalist agenda.  It's -- everybody bears the cost of it.  That  gas tax hike has completely gone away, but the protestors have still been  out four weekends in a row so I -- I'm curious to see if this really does  kind of soothe the unrest. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he's out of touch, which is the -- which is the criticism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  But I need to give Nile Gardiner credit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I used the phrase \"swanning about the globe while (INAUDIBLE)  capital city is burning.  Nile used that phrase over the weekend.  So,  credit to Nile on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he was great when he joined us to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- navigate all of this.  We got a big show this morning.   Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, Ohio Congressman and  House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan is here.  We're going to talk  with the Congressman about that Google hearing among other things.  Plus  Jim Comey, lots to talk about with Jim Jordan.  Michigan Congressman and  House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Debbie Dingell, is with us this  morning.  Congresswoman Dingell has a lot to say about General Motors.   Plus the Chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg Brown, is with us  this morning.  He's turned that company around.  </p><p>And Former British Parliament Member Euro Pacific Capital Senior Economic  Consultant, John Browne, is here as well.  Plus FOX News Senior Strategic  Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane joins us as well.  Don't  miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.  We kick it off  right here with this top story, and that is all of these swings in the  market.  Checking Futures right now, we're expecting a pretty strong  opening for today's trading.  Dow Industrials right now up a hundred and  twelve points, a half a percent higher after a wild day yesterday when the  Dow slid to session lows down better than 500 points after British Prime  Minister Theresa May announced a delay of the exit vote, Britain leaving  European Union.</p><p>But look at that chart, markets reverse in course, as the session wore on  and as you can see, after the lows hit at about 11:15 a.m. in the morning,  things slowly but surely came back only to end higher. When we were down at  11:15 market better than 500 points.  Market was briefly in correction  territory down 20 percent from the high, that means.  Joining us right now,  CIO, EventShares CIO Ben Phillips.  And Ben, it is good to have you on the  program this morning.  </p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CIO, EVENTSHARES:  Thanks for having me, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a market.  How are you doing with all this volatility?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, we've done some things in portfolio raise cash actually on  the Fed pop.  I guess that was a couple of Wednesdays ago.  So, we had a  big day up, markets were up about two percent.  We actually raised cash to  17 percent in portfolio. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.  Big number. </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  So, it was a meaningful move.  You know, I think the  thought was get a little more defensive.  We were pretty skeptical on  anything positive coming out of G20.  And so after we actually saw that  over the weekend, we started to look -- even get a little more defensive. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But longer term, has anything changed in terms of structural,  you know, performance for this market?  Look At the backdrop -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of growth expectations, higher rates, has anything  specifically changed that you really want to shift your allocation and hold  it in cash and just like -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, I think we have to realize that we are late cycle, and  there's going to be more late-cycle activity.  The Fed is pumping the  brakes and what that means is the rate-sensitive sectors are going to see  some of that, you know, giveback and that's what we're seeing.  I think  it's normal to see this type of activity towards the end of the cycle as  the Feds starts its heightening cycle.  So, you know, they said don't fight  the Fed for the past 10 years effectively, don't fight the Feds still, you  know.  They're tightening for a reason, that's going to have implications  on markets.  </p><p>BELL:  One trend that we've seen though on these days, these mornings when  you're up like this by a nice amount -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BELL:  -- we've seen that pop, initial pop, sold into the end of the day  and we end the day -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  -- at the lows, do you expect that today?  When can that trend turn  around? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes, you know, I hear the question.  It's tough to call it a  day-to-day move obviously.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  But I -- you know, I talked to people about a potential rally,  you know, a Santa rally, or even a January rally, which is somewhat  typical.  People are looking to fade, looking to sell into it.  So, I think  that's going to be a trend we're going to see here.  There's been a  rotation that's occurred at the hedge funds where they've derisked.   They've brought down leverage and now we're at a situation where they still  have a little bit more to go, I think.  They're still long tech, they're  still long momentum, so they still have some unwinding of that trade to do.   So, if they're actually thinking the cycle's over, or it's close to the  end, the -- that rotation's going to continue. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yesterday, we had all talks about Brexit, the week before, it  was all about G20.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  If you take out the geopolitical events and you trade only on  the market, what would the market be doing right now? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Well, that's tough.  It's tough.  I mean all we do is connect  the geopolitical events -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Right.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  -- to the market.  So, to say what would happen if there weren't  is -- I mean I think the market would be stronger.  I think, you know,  trade -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I guess my question is -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- are we headed for a recession, are we headed for a slowdown?   Would this market still be selling off even into a Christmas rally?  Which  looks to be a great Christmas retail season -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- but people wonder, is this is the last hurrah?  What's your  view?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I think if we remove the geopolitical, we could see a rally  here.  We -- I think we should see a rally here.  Growth -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not expecting a growth slowdown?  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  No.  What I think is causing it is the confidence crisis right  now.  We've seen China trade actually slowing some supply chains, causing  some drag on growth across the world.  So, that's happening.  Now, if there  is a true pause and we start seeing constructive discussions between U.S.  And China, we could see that actually, you know, reverse course in the  market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, we have a new round of trade talks that we are  reporting this morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade  Representative Robert Lighthizer, holding a call last night with their  Chinese counterparts, reportedly discussing agricultural purchases, changes  to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the Wall Street  Journal, and this comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei  CFO.  She's still waiting to find out whether she will be released on bail.   The decision could come today.  So, this is all intertwined.  </p><p>We did hear -- as soon as he came back from Argentina, Dagen, that the  President said China was going to buy all these agricultural products,  remember?  $1.3 trillion -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- was the number. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because of the trade fight that we've gotten into with China.   And it's a two-party fight, it's not a one-party fight, and it's really  hurt farmers.  Farmers have gotten multibillion dollar bailout from the  Federal government to help them out.  That will be good news.  But I would  caution that there needs to be one voice, while they -- while the U.S. goes  through these trade talks, there needs to be one voice on this, and I would  say it would be the President of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think investors have become accustomed to the way the  President communicates.  People can call it what they want, but that's who  he is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- as Donald Trump, President of the United States.  I think  that this is a moment where a lot of these talking heads in the WHITE HOUSE  need to stay off television.  And I said that yesterday about Peter  Navarro.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, there needs to be one voice and clearly there's been  fighting within the White House over time between Lighthizer, and Navarro,  and Mnuchin, and maybe even Larry Kudlow.  So, just let the President talk  about it.  That's it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apparently, they did have this call last night.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did that change opinions in your view on Wall Street in terms  of where we are in this negotiation? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  You know, I think it's positive to see that we're back at the  table.  Since July -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  -- really, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments weren't really  at the table at a senior level.  It was -- it was barely even junior  staffers having conversations.  So, it's positive to see that.  I think we  saw Trump and Xi go back home after the G20.  While there wasn't a joint  communication, they did go back home and they both tried to spend it  domestically.  \"Hey, we got some things done.  There is some progress.\"  We  took that as a positive cue.  If you look at one silver lining from the  G20, I think that's it, that they said \"We have to get something done  here.\"  They're looking at the markets, both of them.  Their respective  domestic markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you do think we're seeing this rally today because of this  new talk last night, right? </p><p>BELL:  Yes, I definitely think that the rally we're seeing -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what's pushing -- </p><p>BELL:  -- this morning is because of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right now.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  We also have another push for tax reform, Ben.  So what about that?   I mean House Ways and Means Committee Chairman -- </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I don't think that's what's driving markets today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Because Kevin Brady is retooling this tax cuts 2.0 right  now.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's trying to secure more Republican votes, the bill delayed  several healthcare taxes that allows expecting parents to create 529 plans  for their unborn children.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think that has an impact in any way, right? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  No, I think that the plan he released, I think it was the  Wednesday after Thanksgiving or the week after Thanksgiving was more  bipartisan-looking and I think that the revisions are more partisan.  And  so it seems pretty lame ducky some politicking at this point in time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And speaking of politics, I'll throw this in.  I'm hearing this  more and more from investors.  They're really waiting for the Mueller  report to come out, and they point to the two months before the Ken Starr  report came out in 1998, which was in September of that year, granted that  was the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management at that time as well, so  it's hard to separate the two, but in the two months, between mid-July and  the Starr report coming out in September, the S&amp;P fell almost 20 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  About -- more than 90 percent.  Granted the market made back all  that loss by the end of November, but this is -- people are standing back  and now waiting as more and more filings come out of the Mueller Team, out  of the U.S. Attorney in the -- for the Southern District of NEW YORK on  Friday, that's becoming a focus as well.  And I -- Gary B. talked about it  over the weekend. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's one of three really important things that will  probably give us a sense of what's going to happen in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Number one, who did the Democrats put out there to go against  President Trump?  Number two, how's the economy doing?  We'll see if we are  in a growth slowdown come 2020, and number three, the Mueller report. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What comes out of Mueller?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to add one more thing.  I think the markets -- and I know  you'll agree with me, are -- you're getting a little bit of a lift moving  into the week because we did get an inversion of the yield curve between  the two-year and the 10-year to where, you know, if the shorter rates are  higher, that indicates the recession it has for the last 50 years, we  didn't get that last week, and I think that there was a bit of relief among  investors (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because as it was coming close, the two-year -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and the 10-year markets were selling off. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  As narrow as it was since 2007, but we didn't get that  inversion and -- </p><p>BELL:  And the reporting on the Fed potentially walking back, maybe taking  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  -- more of a dovish tone obviously played well into that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Do you buy into that?  Fed's not going to raise as many  as people think right now? </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ray Dalio, by the way, told us he's not -- they're not going to  be able to do it three times next year.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  I don't think so.  I mean, we look at -- if trade continues like  this, that is a drag on growth, and even if it's just discussions, it is  dragging growth, it's dragging confidence, so if we see this continue, I  don't think the Fed's hiking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ben, it's good to have you on the show.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ben Phillips joining us there.  Coming up,  Macron gives in, the French President pledging tax cuts now, and a minimum  wage increase following weeks of dangerous protests where more than a  billion dollars of damage was done.  Then Google is on the hill today, CEO  Sundar Pichai set to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee on  alleged bias against conservatives.  We're going to cover that live and  we'll talk about it next.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More drama across the pond after the U.K.  Government postponed today's scheduled vote on its plan to leave the  European Union.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So many moving parts to this  story, Maria.  Good morning to you.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now in  Brussels after she postponed today's scheduled vote on Britain's plan to  leave the E.U.  May plans to meet with European leaders in order to signal  concessions on the deal, but the E.U. is already ruling out any further  negotiations.  And May could face a challenge to her leadership for rivals  in the Conservative party.  Well, Lord of the Rings actor, Andy Serkis,  reviving his old Gollum character to poke fun at U.K. Prime Minister  Theresa May and her precious Brexit deal, look. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDRY SERKIS:  They told us, precious, they hates the deal.  All of them  hates it.  They wants a People's vote.  People's vote.\" </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Sorry.  Serkis released the video over the weekend with the title  \"Leaked Footage from Inside Number 10 Downing Street.\"  The video has been  viewed, as you can imagine, more than a million times, it released ahead of  the planned parliamentary vote, which, again, is looking like it's going to  be pretty funny.  All right.  </p><p>Let's move to France.  Embattled President Emmanuel Macron promising to cut  taxes and increase the minimum wage as he addressed the nation last night.   His first public comments following four weeks of violent protests over his  economic agenda.  Macron admitting he is partially responsible for the  demonstrations led the by yellow-vest protestors who took to the streets to  oppose higher fuel taxes now they're government changes and been improving  the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator):  And I want to  see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries, and this is why I'm  ordering an end of year bonus for all employees without any tax. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  Last week, Macron suspended a hike in the fuel tax.   Maria, those are your headlines. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of drama coming out.  And I think, Dagen, you made  the point yesterday, \"Well, if you're in Britain, you could look across the  channel and thank God you're not in France right now.\"  What were -- what  were your thoughts of what we heard last night about -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which they think all the time.  I lived in Britain and they  don't really love the French.  They love the food, but not the people who  cook it because they -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think Europe's falling apart.  I've heard they've already got  the 48 letters signed and that they're really to be delivered at any point.   Nobody wants the Prime Minister role right now, but I think that the Brexit  ends up being probably a hard Brexit, which, if that happens, I think Italy  drops out of the E.U. as well, and the E.U. dissolves. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that -- this is a really important point that you're  making here.  I mean you said Europe is falling apart.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know what's going on in France, we know the situation in  Britain, then there's Italy.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the budget issues in Italy.  You're going to have an  election in Germany soon.  I mean -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And the big issue here is -- with -- I'm sorry to cut you off,  the big issue with Italy is if -- England has to -- U.K. has to stay in.   It will tell Italy they have to stay in as well.  If Italy -- if it sees  that England gets out, they could get out as well, which kills the E.U. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, there is something cultural going on that has always  been in place that Italy, they -- that they feel like it's important to  preserve their national culture and their national identity, and it's the  same in France, and it's the same in Britain not having a bunch of, quite  frankly, elitist snots in Brussels telling these countries what to do.  And  I think that it's been -- Macron said last night, this is this outrage by  the yellow-vest who's been 40 years in the making, he's trying to take some  responsibility for it.  But when you are one of those elitist snots, then  your people will turn against you.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  At least they're unelected elitist snots.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the problem, right?  That makes it better somehow?  </p><p>BELL:  This is also all happening when the economy over there is also  slowing down, too, but from lower Levels than we are seeing here, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Germany's contracting. </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was some (INAUDIBLE) yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think this eventually, you know, impacts the United  States though?  I mean, you know, we're talking about Europe falling apart.   This is a major story.  And it of course is going to impact how we see  growth in the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it already has.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Donald J. Trump is evidence of what was going on here  in the United States, the divide between the elitist in our cities, and our  coastal areas -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- and the rural -- and rural America.  People --  their politicians were not listening to people in the Hinterlands. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  All right.  We'll take a short break.   When we come back, there is real frustration at CBS.  Shareholders are  meeting today to talk about the possible legal risks over leaks associated  to the Les Moonves probe.  We've got those details.  And then we're  searching for answers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying today on  Capitol Hill over the search giant's alleged bias against Conservatives.   We'll take you there.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tech is taking the hill.  Google CEO Sundar  Pichai set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee later this  morning.  The Google CEO expected to answer questions on the company's  business practices, including its handling of user data, and potential  political bias.  Joining us right now to talk more about that.  First,  though, here's what House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told me on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FEATURES\" about this hearing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got the CEO of Google coming in to testify, what are you  looking to get out of that? </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, this is something  you have, too, that we've looked at this for quite some time because  technology affects so much of our life.  Two-thirds of every adult American  gets their news from the internet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Yes.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  But there -- there's no other company that has a greater control  over the internet on searches than Google, and Google has not been coming  to any of our hearing, whereas Twitter, Facebook, and others.  Ninety  percent of all internet searches goes through Google.  That's not news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see a regulation?  Are we going to see a bill  come to the floor about bigger power? </p><p>MCCARTHY:  This is why we're having the hearings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  What do we need to protect?  What do we need to stop the bias,  what do we need for competition. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Managing Director of Equity Research at  Wedbush Securities, Daniel Ives.  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you comes out of this?  And as an investor, what do we  need to focus on in terms of these technology companies? </p><p>IVES:  Well, because they're investors' regulation, and that continues to  be the sort of big threat for big tech.  You know, I think right here, you  know, Google's really been the last one to go in front of Congress.  So, I  think really in terms of how they navigate the data privacy, but I think  there's also a big focus on China because if you look at China, especially  with everything going on, you know, Google, how they're looking at  potentially getting into China from a search perspective, their view there,  as well as just the overall privacy, and that's really going to be front  and center here.  </p><p>But big techs' watching this, because, you know, this continues to be an  overhang on the space from a regulatory perspective. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Speaking about China, I mean Google decided to work with  China with its in A.I. and yet it said that it didn't want to work with the  Pentagon, it didn't want to be anywhere near the U.S. Government, and yet  tries to have this national score, individual scores for people where  they're watching you at all times, spying on you, and then at the end of  the year, you get a score and that may dictate if you can get on a plane,  get on a train, get a mortgage, I mean it's incredible.  And Google is  obviously enabling that. </p><p>IVES:  Well, because -- and that's why, like, they find themselves in the  crosshairs, because the thing about what's happening in broader with China,  you look at 5G, you look at this battle between U.S. and China across tech.   You're going to see more and more.  U.S. and tech are going to be battling,  you know, specifically on China when it comes to 5G, A.I., and Google is  sort of the center of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BELL:  And with regulation, regulation in the U.S. is very different from  China, very different from Europe, where they just passed the GDPR, General  Data Protection Regulation, this year.  How do these companies navigate  those waters?  What kind of expense does that cause and how do they get  from point A to being able to deal with all that? </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean with GDPR, I think that was when there was a big fear  going into that in May.  I think so far, you know, that's when it's been  pretty contained, and that's going to continue to be sort of a unicorn in  terms Of how much regulation you see overseas.  But, look, no doubt, I mean  look from an investor perspective, just given what we're seeing in the  market, the last thing you want to sort of come out of left field today --  and this also has given -- we saw yesterday with Apple getting Qualcomm and  China, you know, so that's the broader backdrop of tech where some of these  things were never factored into valuations.  Now you're seeing it.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  How do you trade Apple?  I've known Apple for years.  Obviously  got a big profit, it's had a great run-up, but right now, it's trading on  geopolitical news.  These, tariffs, as they kick in, could hurt the global  supply chain significantly.  Do you stay away from Apple completely here or  do you find some type of value here at a lower valuation?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And before you answer, let me just say that a Chinese court is  now ordering Apple to stop selling older iPhone models -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- after it found that the company violated two patents held by  Qualcomm. </p><p>IVES:  Yes, that was a major gut punch.  That really came out of left field  because if you go to Qualcomm-Apple situation, it's gone on for a long  time, you look what's happening in China, China is going to be 20, 25  percent of the incremental growth for Apple.  So, if you look at the  tariffs, you will get the situation right.  We continue to believe that  there's value in Apple here where it's trading, but no doubt, I mean if the  90-day period comes and tariffs get up to that 25 percent, and potentially  on iPhones, you know, that really could be a backbreaker for Apple. </p><p>But right here, we continue to be buying that name from a valuation just  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean the stocks now were at their lowest earnings  multiples in years because they've taken such a beating, so what are they  trading in now? </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean if you look right now, I mean look, $15.00 of earnings  for Apple?  OK.  You're talking about so that's now trading, you know, for  (INAUDIBLE) trade 12 to 16 times, trading below that historical range.  So,  you're are starting to get now down to trough levels where you're starting  to bake in some significant bad news into Apple.  OK, every day, the sun  comes up and there's bad news in Apple. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p>IVES:  So I think it's been just a massive string of bad news, if you've  seen the last six weeks, but ultimately a lot it's self-inflicted.  Because  you will get cooked.  Once they away took iPhone metric and transparency  decreased, that set off the storm here and you've continued seeing through  the suppliers. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  So do you not buy the services' idea?  That the service is going  from 10 billion to 50 billion, and Apple's now serves as company.  You  still think it's a hardware company that is dependent upon that sale of the  iPhones for the valuation.  </p><p>IVES:  Look, it's a services-led hardware company and we're talking about  the 50 billion in services -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Correct.  Yes.  </p><p>IVES:  -- in 2020.  That -- from sum of the parts, we believe that's worth  about 400 billion, that's service's business.</p><p>So, right here, you get in a core iPhone business, for 3 to 400 billion,  but, nonetheless, it's a hardware iPhone business in the near term, 60  percent that's where it comes from.  So, right now, that's going to rule  the day which is why right now, the disappointing we've seen with 10Rs  specifically added China, that's really been with the gut punch for Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you still like the stocks?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we -- look, we continue -- we're not waving the white flag on  Apple.  We are buyers of Apple here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about Google?</p><p>IVES:  Look, in our opinion right now, in large cap, we much rather own an  Apple versus some of these other names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>IVES:  You know, in large cap, just given the valuation and given we know  that there's a cycle there with regulatory risks with (INAUDIBLE) minimum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's Google on the hill today, so we'll see what happens with  the Alphabet parent of Google, Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>IVES:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Daniel Ives joining us.  Stay with FOX  Business, we're taking you live to Sundar Pichai's testimony, begins at  10:00 a.m. Eastern today, join us and we will roll on that for you.</p><p>First, though, a major meeting today between President Trump and top  Democrat leaders, with border wall funding at the Fore Front, Chuck Schumer  and Nancy Pelosi headed to the White House.</p><p>Then, Nirvana smells like teen spirit, losing its crown as the most  streamed song from 20th century, we'll tell you what tune knocked it off  from the top spot, coming up, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th,  your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Stocks are extending gains this morning.  Take a look at Futures,  indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning.  We are expecting  a big opening with the Dow Industrials up 160 points, that's two-thirds of  one percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ up almost one  percent, 60 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p>There is a run in technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major  comeback yesterday, check this out.  The Dow had been down 507 points, on  the news out of the U.K., and at the close, ended up 34 points.  Fractional  gain but it was a wild one and the market came all the way off of the lows.</p><p>The NASDAQ was up 51 points.  The market was initially hit as British Prime  Minister Theresa May cancelled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  Now, spokesperson for May is reportedly saying that the  government will bring the deal back for a vote by January 21st.  All right,  January 21.</p><p>In Europe this morning, rally there, as well, FT 100 up one and a quarter  percent, 85 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and two-thirds  percent, 78 points higher, DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 163  points higher right now, in Germany.  Small action in Asia, overnight, as  you can see, very fractional moves there, and it was a mixed story.</p><p>A new round of talks is underway.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talked to trade with China's  vice premier on the telephone, last night.  We are watching that.  And I  think that's one of the reasons this market has a firmer tone.</p><p>Then, America's farmers, in the spotlight, Congress is expected to pass a  five-year $867 billion-dollar farm bill, the compromise bill leaving out  (INAUDIBLE) work requirements for food stamps recipients.  We'll have all  the details, there.</p><p>Plus, the Moonves legacy, the CBS board meeting ahead of today's -- an  annual shareholders meeting, we'll tell you what members of the board are  reportedly concerned about on the Les Moonves exit.</p><p>And then, there's this, the Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, has lost  its crown as the most steamed song from the 20th century, the tune that  knocked it out, coming up, right here.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is a shutdown showdown, President Trump is  expected to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, today, at the White House.</p><p>They are trying to strike a deal on funding for the border wall.  The  Democratic leaders will reportedly offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall,  that is a stark difference from the $5 billion, the President is  requesting.  The meeting comes ahead of the looming December 21st deadline  to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>I spoke with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" Sunday.  He weighed in on advice for today's big meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  are going to be meeting with the President on Tuesday, to talk  about the spending bill and the border wall funding.  Why can't the Senate  get on board with the President's border wall funding, sir?</p><p>GRAHAM:  Look at the caravan, look at the charge against the border, look  at the caravans that are to come, look at the holes in our border security,  so here is the problem, you've got the Democratic leader to be in the  House, calling border security, a wall component, immoral.</p><p>If I'm President Trump, Tuesday, I would tell Nancy Pelosi and Chuck  Schumer that we're going to build a wall where it makes sense.  If I were  the President, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding.   I want the whole 5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.</p><p>1.6 is available to the President, he wants 5, and after the caravan, if  you don't see the need for additional border security, you're just not  paying much attention, so Mr. President, dig in, do not give in when it  comes to the law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it the Senate who's stopping this?  I mean, every  time we ask congressman, they say it's passed.  We've got the money in the  House.  It's the Senate.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, you've got to have the speaker of the house who will be in  charge next year, what about next year?  So here's what's happening in the  Senate, we need 60 votes to get 5 billion.  If I were the president, I  would tell the Democrats, I want $5 billion for wall security because for  border security, including a wall, because we need it from the threats  we're facing, this caravan and others to follow.</p><p>And I'd put DACA on the table.  There are 700,000 young people who came  here on the average age of 6, have got no place to go.  They're in the DACA  program, if I were the president, I'd say, I want two years of wall funding  and I'll give legal status to the DACA recipients.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GRAHAM:  That's good deal for the country.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst,  Retired General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Your reaction -- </p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see  you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to all of this, will the President get the money?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know, because I'm not good at testing the  temperature, you know, the Congress of the United States.  I think,  fundamentally, the wall is necessary.  Take the politics out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  The border and customs people have been telling us for years, we've  got 600 miles of border security right now, in terms of some kind of  fencing.  And as we have seen in recent television exposures -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  some of that is inadequate, so we've got to fix that.  And then,  we've got to build about 800 more miles of fencing or wall to provide some  degree of security.  And then, there's about -- you know, we've got about  2,500 miles of border, so we're not going to build it in all places, but we  need in certain places, the funnel people in other place where the border  control and customs people can be -- to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  I mean, it is fundamentally a sovereignty issue, Maria.  I think  the President -- the strength of the argument is on his side, given what we  have seen in the last few weeks, with people coming by the thousands, even  though most of them are motivated in terms of economic opportunity, some of  them are motivated because they're passing drugs and they're criminals, but  the overall majority just want a better life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, and we've got that.  But, you know, other people that are  standing in line by the thousands, in front of them, and they've got to get  behind that line, and we've got to get some kind of control.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's an important meeting today, because, you know, the  President has talked about striking deals with the Democrats on  infrastructure, but they've been pretty -- you know, they've been saying,  look, we're not giving you any more money for this wall beyond 1.3 billion.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how he can -- it's an early test of his  ability to work with the Democrats on anything.  But let's get to defense  budget, because this is something I know you care about so much, the  President has told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to submit a $750 billion  budget proposal for fiscal 2020.</p><p>I spoke with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday, he weighed in on the  border funding battle, as well as defense spending.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this all about getting the money for the President's border  wall?  Is that what this fight is about?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We need our borders, stronger, strong and secure, especially  with the caravan and others.  In the House version, we have five billion.   The Senate version has 1.6, and what the President is saying is, I want a  deal.</p><p>That's why Schumer has a process in this, but he's going to have Schumer  come in.  Now, Nancy Pelosi is in a different position.  She's having a  battle to become speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You have to have 218 votes on the floor, so that's January --  but we have to get this all done in the next two weeks.  You know the type  of new members she has, coming in.  They're much more socialist  progressive.  They don't go to her office to visit her.  They go to her  office to join in the protest, so she has a challenge that she doesn't want  to vote for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She doesn't want anything done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She wants to be speaker.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Exactly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there you go, General, she doesn't want to vote for  anything, she wants to be speaker.  She's not going to do anything  different to rock the boat on her speakership.  But the defense budget is  basically already funded, but now, what's your take on 2020?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, this is a huge thing that the President has done, because the  Director of OMB, Mulvaney, tasked every single department in our government  to take up five percent haircut cut to include defense -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  which would've stopped the Trump build-up, and what has happened  here is, the chairmans of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee and  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have met with the President and said, Mr.  President, if you do that, then the Trump build-up is going to stop and  we're going to go right back to where we were, before you became president.</p><p>And so, he has decided, we're going to increase the defense budget, which  is, I was on a commission for a year, the Commission on the Defense  National Strategy, looking at this.  And we believe that you need three to  five percent increase, to account for two percent inflation increase, so  you can grow the budget.</p><p>So, that is where we are, and that will be -- that will be argued with the  Democrats who are going to control the House Armed Services Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's even for 2020, right?  The $750 billion -- </p><p>KEANE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  for 2020?  General, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, shareholders shaken, a  big meeting today at CBS, to talk about potential leaks associated with the  Les Moonves scandal, we are on it, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Five Marines missing after a crash off of Japan.   They've now been declared dead.  Cheryl Casone with details and headlines  now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Those five Marines went missing after a mid- air collision off the coast of Japan, south of Muroto Cape.  There is the  map for you on your screen.  The U.S. Marine Corps has suspended its search  after a refueling plane collided with the F-18 Hornet fighter jet late last  week during regularly scheduled training.  The weapon's system officer in  that jet ejected, he survived; the pilot also ejected but was later  pronounced dead.  </p><p>Well, CBS board members are reportedly concerned about the legal  ramifications of the investigation into Les Moonves' alleged sexual  misconduct.  Wall Street Journal reports they are worried that leaks could  expose the networks to even more legal liability, some are calling for a  probe into the source of these leaks.  Amid all of this, folks, CBS  shareholders are holding annual their annual meeting today; protestors  expected outside to demand the company deny Moonves' $120 million severance  payout.  </p><p>Well, Universal Music Group has released its list of for the most streamed  songs from the pre-streaming era.  You know, the 70s, folks.  And only one  song reigns supreme.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FREDDIE MERCURY, VOCALIST, QUEEN:  Any way the wind blows doesn't really  matter to me, to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" the most streamed song from the 20th Century.   It is also seen as spiking popularity, obviously, since the release of the  Freddie Mercury biopic movie that came out last month, which was huge hit,  by the way at the box officer.  Here is the rest of top five: at number  five, \"Take on Me\" by A-ha -- remember that one?  Right?  I love that we're  all 80s kids here.  Guns 'n Roses, has the next two spots with \"November  Rain\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\"  Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has  been played more than 1.5 billion.  And yes, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" despite  being six minutes long, number one, 1.6 billion streams.  I love that we  all get each other in our musical taste. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love all of those songs.  </p><p>CASONE:  Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think I'm going to have \"Take on Me\" in my head all day,  though, now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A-ha, of all bands, to make the top five.  And \"November Rain,\"  really, kind of one of the bottom, like, five songs ever recorded by G&amp;R.   What about \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" or (INAUDIBLE), any of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, where was that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, take a break, when we come back, the finer  things; why more people are investing in their money in fine arts?  That's  straight ahead.  Wait until you see what we've got to show you next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, as we look at the stock market rallying  this morning, we're also looking at art as an investment as the number of  billionaires and wealthy individuals continues to grow.  More and more are  turn to fine art as a way to invest their money according to the 2017 Night  Frank Luxury Investment Index, art was the most popular luxury investment  ahead of assets like wine, coins and jewelry.  Joining us right now is Fine  Art Curator, Michael Witmer.  Michael, it's good to see you, thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>MICHAEL WITMER, FINE ART CURATOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us what's been happening over the last, what, couple  of years in number of the number of billionaires investing their money in  art?  </p><p>WITMER:  We're seeing more billionaires being created than ever before.   We're seeing them being created in far fun places where we haven't seen  billionaires before throughout Asia: China, India, and places like  Malaysia, the Philippines which didn't have many billionaires.  They're  building their own museums, they're pushing up the prices.  We will  continue to see blue chip prices go through the roof because that's what  they want for the walls of their museums.  So, we're seeing the supply go  down and demand go up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of art are they most interested in?  </p><p>WITMER:  They seems to be interested in real museum pieces for --  especially French impressionism, early modern artist like Picasso, Mone,  van Gogh.  We will probably see prices of the good old (INAUDIBLE) start to  go up again.  And once we see those go up, there's no stopping them.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  Is it (INAUDIBLE) independent.  (INAUDIBLE) American  billionaires buys different artist, a Da Vinci art or a Picasso for  instance, compared to, say, Asian billionaires?  </p><p>WITMER:  It used to be that way.  But now, we've seen a worldwide increase,  drastic increase in museum attendance, more people are studying art history  than ever before.  If you look 26 years ago with the Louvre, there were 2.5  million visitors and they thought they would never get that high.  Last  year and the year before, it was just barely shy of 10 million visitors.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>WITMER:  Most major museums are seeing that.  So, as a result, to answer  your question, we're seeing the museums throughout the world, the  billionaire collectors throughout the world now collecting the same thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this story.  I want to ask you about this mystery,  though, in the art world.  Last year, we saw the most expensive art sale on  record.  We talked about it on this program a lot, you came on the show to  discuss it.  This was Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi.  It was bought  by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $450 million.  Now,  the master piece has not been seen since its purchase last year.  Scholars  are worried about where it is, where is this painting, where do you think?  </p><p>WITMER:  At $450 million, that painting had its own armed guards and  escorts everywhere it went.  It was probably as safe as President Trump has  ever been.  It's not uncommon in the part of the world for the buyers to  hang something in the living room, enjoy it for a little while, and then  share it with the world.  Also, because they're building beautiful new  Louvre museum that is now opened, it's spectacular.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Saudi.  </p><p>WITMER:  Yes, and they're building more -- that's in Abu Dhabi, and they're  building more museums throughout that region.  So, they may be looking to  make more acquisitions before they show everything.  The idea that one 450  million-dollar Leonardo is not enough.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazing story.  Yes, maybe it is in MBS's home?  </p><p>WITMER:  Could be.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>WITMER:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We will be right back.  Google is in the  hot seat.  We're going to talk about a CEO Sundar Pichai headed to Capitol  Hill to testify, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, ladies. Thank you so much. We will see you in a little bit. Big day today. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 11th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the EAST COAST. Stocks are extending gains right now, we are at the highs of the morning with a big rally underway. Dow Industrials set to open up this morning better than a hundred points, the S&amp;P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 38 points, that's two-thirds of one percent higher this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a wild day yesterday on Wall Street, markets were volatile, climbing from the lowest to the end of the day in positive territory. Big rally toward the end of the day, taking the market off of the lows. The Dow had been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union. Then, by the close, as you can see, markets reversed course. Up 34 points at the close on the Dow.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also seeing a bit of a bounce, take a look at FT-100 up better than one percent, 69 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris is up 71 points, one and a half percent higher, and the DAX Index in Germany also higher by one and a half percent, that's a hundred and fifty- seven points higher this morning. In Asia overnight, markets with little change, as you can see there, very fractional moves and mixed. Trade talks are moving forward. The U.S. and China holding a new round of negotiations last night. We have the very latest on where that stands.</p><p>And coming together, President Trump set to meet with House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and funding the border wall among top items on the agenda, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will go to the White House. Democrats reportedly ready to offer to $1.3 billion for the wall, but that is the short of the President's $5 billion request. Google's turn on the hot seat today. CEO Sundar Pichai's headed to Capitol Hill today. He will testify before the House Judiciary Committee. FOX Business will bring you that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. We will take a look at what to expect from his testimony this morning.</p><p>Then Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit losing its crown as the most streamed song from the 20th century. We'll tell you what tune knocked it off the top spot, all that coming up this morning. All those stories coming up. Joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport Global Ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John Layfield. It's great to see you this morning.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BEYOND SPORT GLOBAL AMBASSADOR: It's great to see you. Going to be a crazy week. With the Brexit, its potential government shutdown, this is going to be nuts.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Nice to see the green though in the market this morning, really. Positive reaction to some of this trade news and especially in Europe, all in the green after yesterday's Brexit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see how it closes. The market's volatility has been just unreal.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. It's a market that's trading off headlines, that's trading off commentary, from somebody, anybody, everybody, coming out of the White House, and I think that that's going to be the case. Other than the Federal Reserve meeting in the month of December, that's really the only, like, hardcore piece of news that we have coming up that we -- that we know about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We talked yesterday about the fact that the President of France, Macron, has not been seen in the face of all of these riots. We did hear from him yesterday, Dagen. What did do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He is pledging tax cuts and minimum wage hikes to placate protesters, but, again, I want to point out that the -- kind of the kickoff to these yellow-vest protests was a gas tax hike to push his environmental agenda, and I think that that is an actually -- it's an honest move because that is what it does take if you want to broadly reduce emissions and push an environmentalist agenda. It's -- everybody bears the cost of it. That gas tax hike has completely gone away, but the protestors have still been out four weekends in a row so I -- I'm curious to see if this really does kind of soothe the unrest.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because they say --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- he's out of touch, which is the -- which is the criticism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. But I need to give Nile Gardiner credit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I used the phrase \"swanning about the globe while (INAUDIBLE) capital city is burning. Nile used that phrase over the weekend. So, credit to Nile on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he was great when he joined us to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- navigate all of this. We got a big show this morning. Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, Ohio Congressman and House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan is here. We're going to talk with the Congressman about that Google hearing among other things. Plus Jim Comey, lots to talk about with Jim Jordan. Michigan Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Debbie Dingell, is with us this morning. Congresswoman Dingell has a lot to say about General Motors. Plus the Chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg Brown, is with us this morning. He's turned that company around.</p><p>And Former British Parliament Member Euro Pacific Capital Senior Economic Consultant, John Browne, is here as well. Plus FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane joins us as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big three hours coming up. We kick it off right here with this top story, and that is all of these swings in the market. Checking Futures right now, we're expecting a pretty strong opening for today's trading. Dow Industrials right now up a hundred and twelve points, a half a percent higher after a wild day yesterday when the Dow slid to session lows down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a delay of the exit vote, Britain leaving European Union.</p><p>But look at that chart, markets reverse in course, as the session wore on and as you can see, after the lows hit at about 11:15 a.m. in the morning, things slowly but surely came back only to end higher. When we were down at 11:15 market better than 500 points. Market was briefly in correction territory down 20 percent from the high, that means. Joining us right now, CIO, EventShares CIO Ben Phillips. And Ben, it is good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CIO, EVENTSHARES: Thanks for having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a market. How are you doing with all this volatility?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, we've done some things in portfolio raise cash actually on the Fed pop. I guess that was a couple of Wednesdays ago. So, we had a big day up, markets were up about two percent. We actually raised cash to 17 percent in portfolio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, wow. Big number.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes. So, it was a meaningful move. You know, I think the thought was get a little more defensive. We were pretty skeptical on anything positive coming out of G20. And so after we actually saw that over the weekend, we started to look -- even get a little more defensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But longer term, has anything changed in terms of structural, you know, performance for this market? Look At the backdrop --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in terms of growth expectations, higher rates, has anything specifically changed that you really want to shift your allocation and hold it in cash and just like --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, I think we have to realize that we are late cycle, and there's going to be more late-cycle activity. The Fed is pumping the brakes and what that means is the rate-sensitive sectors are going to see some of that, you know, giveback and that's what we're seeing. I think it's normal to see this type of activity towards the end of the cycle as the Feds starts its heightening cycle. So, you know, they said don't fight the Fed for the past 10 years effectively, don't fight the Feds still, you know. They're tightening for a reason, that's going to have implications on markets.</p><p>BELL: One trend that we've seen though on these days, these mornings when you're up like this by a nice amount --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL: -- we've seen that pop, initial pop, sold into the end of the day and we end the day --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes.</p><p>BELL: -- at the lows, do you expect that today? When can that trend turn around?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, you know, I hear the question. It's tough to call it a day-to-day move obviously.</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>PHILLIPS: But I -- you know, I talked to people about a potential rally, you know, a Santa rally, or even a January rally, which is somewhat typical. People are looking to fade, looking to sell into it. So, I think that's going to be a trend we're going to see here. There's been a rotation that's occurred at the hedge funds where they've derisked. They've brought down leverage and now we're at a situation where they still have a little bit more to go, I think. They're still long tech, they're still long momentum, so they still have some unwinding of that trade to do. So, if they're actually thinking the cycle's over, or it's close to the end, the -- that rotation's going to continue.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yesterday, we had all talks about Brexit, the week before, it was all about G20.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>LAYFIELD: If you take out the geopolitical events and you trade only on the market, what would the market be doing right now?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, that's tough. It's tough. I mean all we do is connect the geopolitical events --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Right.</p><p>PHILLIPS: -- to the market. So, to say what would happen if there weren't is -- I mean I think the market would be stronger. I think, you know, trade --</p><p>LAYFIELD: I guess my question is --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- are we headed for a recession, are we headed for a slowdown? Would this market still be selling off even into a Christmas rally? Which looks to be a great Christmas retail season --</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- but people wonder, is this is the last hurrah? What's your view?</p><p>PHILLIPS: I think if we remove the geopolitical, we could see a rally here. We -- I think we should see a rally here. Growth --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're not expecting a growth slowdown?</p><p>PHILLIPS: No. What I think is causing it is the confidence crisis right now. We've seen China trade actually slowing some supply chains, causing some drag on growth across the world. So, that's happening. Now, if there is a true pause and we start seeing constructive discussions between U.S. And China, we could see that actually, you know, reverse course in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, we have a new round of trade talks that we are reporting this morning. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, holding a call last night with their Chinese counterparts, reportedly discussing agricultural purchases, changes to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the Wall Street Journal, and this comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei CFO. She's still waiting to find out whether she will be released on bail. The decision could come today. So, this is all intertwined.</p><p>We did hear -- as soon as he came back from Argentina, Dagen, that the President said China was going to buy all these agricultural products, remember? $1.3 trillion --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- was the number.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of the trade fight that we've gotten into with China. And it's a two-party fight, it's not a one-party fight, and it's really hurt farmers. Farmers have gotten multibillion dollar bailout from the Federal government to help them out. That will be good news. But I would caution that there needs to be one voice, while they -- while the U.S. goes through these trade talks, there needs to be one voice on this, and I would say it would be the President of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think investors have become accustomed to the way the President communicates. People can call it what they want, but that's who he is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- as Donald Trump, President of the United States. I think that this is a moment where a lot of these talking heads in the WHITE HOUSE need to stay off television. And I said that yesterday about Peter Navarro.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, there needs to be one voice and clearly there's been fighting within the White House over time between Lighthizer, and Navarro, and Mnuchin, and maybe even Larry Kudlow. So, just let the President talk about it. That's it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Apparently, they did have this call last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did that change opinions in your view on Wall Street in terms of where we are in this negotiation?</p><p>PHILLIPS: You know, I think it's positive to see that we're back at the table. Since July --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PHILLIPS: -- really, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments weren't really at the table at a senior level. It was -- it was barely even junior staffers having conversations. So, it's positive to see that. I think we saw Trump and Xi go back home after the G20. While there wasn't a joint communication, they did go back home and they both tried to spend it domestically. \"Hey, we got some things done. There is some progress.\" We took that as a positive cue. If you look at one silver lining from the G20, I think that's it, that they said \"We have to get something done here.\" They're looking at the markets, both of them. Their respective domestic markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you do think we're seeing this rally today because of this new talk last night, right?</p><p>BELL: Yes, I definitely think that the rally we're seeing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what's pushing --</p><p>BELL: -- this morning is because of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right now.</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>BELL: We also have another push for tax reform, Ben. So what about that? I mean House Ways and Means Committee Chairman --</p><p>PHILLIPS: I don't think that's what's driving markets today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Because Kevin Brady is retooling this tax cuts 2.0 right now.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's trying to secure more Republican votes, the bill delayed several healthcare taxes that allows expecting parents to create 529 plans for their unborn children.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you don't think that has an impact in any way, right?</p><p>PHILLIPS: No, I think that the plan he released, I think it was the Wednesday after Thanksgiving or the week after Thanksgiving was more bipartisan-looking and I think that the revisions are more partisan. And so it seems pretty lame ducky some politicking at this point in time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And speaking of politics, I'll throw this in. I'm hearing this more and more from investors. They're really waiting for the Mueller report to come out, and they point to the two months before the Ken Starr report came out in 1998, which was in September of that year, granted that was the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management at that time as well, so it's hard to separate the two, but in the two months, between mid-July and the Starr report coming out in September, the S&amp;P fell almost 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: About -- more than 90 percent. Granted the market made back all that loss by the end of November, but this is -- people are standing back and now waiting as more and more filings come out of the Mueller Team, out of the U.S. Attorney in the -- for the Southern District of NEW YORK on Friday, that's becoming a focus as well. And I -- Gary B. talked about it over the weekend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's one of three really important things that will probably give us a sense of what's going to happen in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Number one, who did the Democrats put out there to go against President Trump? Number two, how's the economy doing? We'll see if we are in a growth slowdown come 2020, and number three, the Mueller report.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What comes out of Mueller?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to add one more thing. I think the markets -- and I know you'll agree with me, are -- you're getting a little bit of a lift moving into the week because we did get an inversion of the yield curve between the two-year and the 10-year to where, you know, if the shorter rates are higher, that indicates the recession it has for the last 50 years, we didn't get that last week, and I think that there was a bit of relief among investors (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because as it was coming close, the two-year --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and the 10-year markets were selling off.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. As narrow as it was since 2007, but we didn't get that inversion and --</p><p>BELL: And the reporting on the Fed potentially walking back, maybe taking --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BELL: -- more of a dovish tone obviously played well into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Do you buy into that? Fed's not going to raise as many as people think right now?</p><p>PHILLIPS: I -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ray Dalio, by the way, told us he's not -- they're not going to be able to do it three times next year.</p><p>PHILLIPS: I don't think so. I mean, we look at -- if trade continues like this, that is a drag on growth, and even if it's just discussions, it is dragging growth, it's dragging confidence, so if we see this continue, I don't think the Fed's hiking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ben, it's good to have you on the show.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Ben Phillips joining us there. Coming up, Macron gives in, the French President pledging tax cuts now, and a minimum wage increase following weeks of dangerous protests where more than a billion dollars of damage was done. Then Google is on the hill today, CEO Sundar Pichai set to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee on alleged bias against conservatives. We're going to cover that live and we'll talk about it next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More drama across the pond after the U.K. Government postponed today's scheduled vote on its plan to leave the European Union. Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So many moving parts to this story, Maria. Good morning to you. Prime Minister Theresa May is now in Brussels after she postponed today's scheduled vote on Britain's plan to leave the E.U. May plans to meet with European leaders in order to signal concessions on the deal, but the E.U. is already ruling out any further negotiations. And May could face a challenge to her leadership for rivals in the Conservative party. Well, Lord of the Rings actor, Andy Serkis, reviving his old Gollum character to poke fun at U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and her precious Brexit deal, look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDRY SERKIS: They told us, precious, they hates the deal. All of them hates it. They wants a People's vote. People's vote.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Sorry. Serkis released the video over the weekend with the title \"Leaked Footage from Inside Number 10 Downing Street.\" The video has been viewed, as you can imagine, more than a million times, it released ahead of the planned parliamentary vote, which, again, is looking like it's going to be pretty funny. All right.</p><p>Let's move to France. Embattled President Emmanuel Macron promising to cut taxes and increase the minimum wage as he addressed the nation last night. His first public comments following four weeks of violent protests over his economic agenda. Macron admitting he is partially responsible for the demonstrations led the by yellow-vest protestors who took to the streets to oppose higher fuel taxes now they're government changes and been improving the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): And I want to see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries, and this is why I'm ordering an end of year bonus for all employees without any tax.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm. Last week, Macron suspended a hike in the fuel tax. Maria, those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot of drama coming out. And I think, Dagen, you made the point yesterday, \"Well, if you're in Britain, you could look across the channel and thank God you're not in France right now.\" What were -- what were your thoughts of what we heard last night about --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which they think all the time. I lived in Britain and they don't really love the French. They love the food, but not the people who cook it because they --</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think Europe's falling apart. I've heard they've already got the 48 letters signed and that they're really to be delivered at any point. Nobody wants the Prime Minister role right now, but I think that the Brexit ends up being probably a hard Brexit, which, if that happens, I think Italy drops out of the E.U. as well, and the E.U. dissolves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that -- this is a really important point that you're making here. I mean you said Europe is falling apart.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we know what's going on in France, we know the situation in Britain, then there's Italy.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the budget issues in Italy. You're going to have an election in Germany soon. I mean --</p><p>LAYFIELD: And the big issue here is -- with -- I'm sorry to cut you off, the big issue with Italy is if -- England has to -- U.K. has to stay in. It will tell Italy they have to stay in as well. If Italy -- if it sees that England gets out, they could get out as well, which kills the E.U.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, there is something cultural going on that has always been in place that Italy, they -- that they feel like it's important to preserve their national culture and their national identity, and it's the same in France, and it's the same in Britain not having a bunch of, quite frankly, elitist snots in Brussels telling these countries what to do. And I think that it's been -- Macron said last night, this is this outrage by the yellow-vest who's been 40 years in the making, he's trying to take some responsibility for it. But when you are one of those elitist snots, then your people will turn against you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: At least they're unelected elitist snots.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the problem, right? That makes it better somehow?</p><p>BELL: This is also all happening when the economy over there is also slowing down, too, but from lower Levels than we are seeing here, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Germany's contracting.</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was some (INAUDIBLE) yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't you think this eventually, you know, impacts the United States though? I mean, you know, we're talking about Europe falling apart. This is a major story. And it of course is going to impact how we see growth in the U.S.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it already has.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Donald J. Trump is evidence of what was going on here in the United States, the divide between the elitist in our cities, and our coastal areas --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and the -- and the rural -- and rural America. People -- their politicians were not listening to people in the Hinterlands.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. All right. We'll take a short break. When we come back, there is real frustration at CBS. Shareholders are meeting today to talk about the possible legal risks over leaks associated to the Les Moonves probe. We've got those details. And then we're searching for answers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying today on Capitol Hill over the search giant's alleged bias against Conservatives. We'll take you there. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tech is taking the hill. Google CEO Sundar Pichai set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee later this morning. The Google CEO expected to answer questions on the company's business practices, including its handling of user data, and potential political bias. Joining us right now to talk more about that. First, though, here's what House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told me on \"SUNDAY MORNING FEATURES\" about this hearing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got the CEO of Google coming in to testify, what are you looking to get out of that?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Well, this is something you have, too, that we've looked at this for quite some time because technology affects so much of our life. Two-thirds of every adult American gets their news from the internet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But there -- there's no other company that has a greater control over the internet on searches than Google, and Google has not been coming to any of our hearing, whereas Twitter, Facebook, and others. Ninety percent of all internet searches goes through Google. That's not news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are we going to see a regulation? Are we going to see a bill come to the floor about bigger power?</p><p>MCCARTHY: This is why we're having the hearings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCCARTHY: What do we need to protect? What do we need to stop the bias, what do we need for competition.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, Daniel Ives. Good to see you, Dan.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you comes out of this? And as an investor, what do we need to focus on in terms of these technology companies?</p><p>IVES: Well, because they're investors' regulation, and that continues to be the sort of big threat for big tech. You know, I think right here, you know, Google's really been the last one to go in front of Congress. So, I think really in terms of how they navigate the data privacy, but I think there's also a big focus on China because if you look at China, especially with everything going on, you know, Google, how they're looking at potentially getting into China from a search perspective, their view there, as well as just the overall privacy, and that's really going to be front and center here.</p><p>But big techs' watching this, because, you know, this continues to be an overhang on the space from a regulatory perspective.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Speaking about China, I mean Google decided to work with China with its in A.I. and yet it said that it didn't want to work with the Pentagon, it didn't want to be anywhere near the U.S. Government, and yet tries to have this national score, individual scores for people where they're watching you at all times, spying on you, and then at the end of the year, you get a score and that may dictate if you can get on a plane, get on a train, get a mortgage, I mean it's incredible. And Google is obviously enabling that.</p><p>IVES: Well, because -- and that's why, like, they find themselves in the crosshairs, because the thing about what's happening in broader with China, you look at 5G, you look at this battle between U.S. and China across tech. You're going to see more and more. U.S. and tech are going to be battling, you know, specifically on China when it comes to 5G, A.I., and Google is sort of the center of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BELL: And with regulation, regulation in the U.S. is very different from China, very different from Europe, where they just passed the GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, this year. How do these companies navigate those waters? What kind of expense does that cause and how do they get from point A to being able to deal with all that?</p><p>IVES: Yes. I mean with GDPR, I think that was when there was a big fear going into that in May. I think so far, you know, that's when it's been pretty contained, and that's going to continue to be sort of a unicorn in terms Of how much regulation you see overseas. But, look, no doubt, I mean look from an investor perspective, just given what we're seeing in the market, the last thing you want to sort of come out of left field today -- and this also has given -- we saw yesterday with Apple getting Qualcomm and China, you know, so that's the broader backdrop of tech where some of these things were never factored into valuations. Now you're seeing it.</p><p>LAYFIELD: How do you trade Apple? I've known Apple for years. Obviously got a big profit, it's had a great run-up, but right now, it's trading on geopolitical news. These, tariffs, as they kick in, could hurt the global supply chain significantly. Do you stay away from Apple completely here or do you find some type of value here at a lower valuation?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And before you answer, let me just say that a Chinese court is now ordering Apple to stop selling older iPhone models --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- after it found that the company violated two patents held by Qualcomm.</p><p>IVES: Yes, that was a major gut punch. That really came out of left field because if you go to Qualcomm-Apple situation, it's gone on for a long time, you look what's happening in China, China is going to be 20, 25 percent of the incremental growth for Apple. So, if you look at the tariffs, you will get the situation right. We continue to believe that there's value in Apple here where it's trading, but no doubt, I mean if the 90-day period comes and tariffs get up to that 25 percent, and potentially on iPhones, you know, that really could be a backbreaker for Apple.</p><p>But right here, we continue to be buying that name from a valuation just (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean the stocks now were at their lowest earnings multiples in years because they've taken such a beating, so what are they trading in now?</p><p>IVES: Yes. I mean if you look right now, I mean look, $15.00 of earnings for Apple? OK. You're talking about so that's now trading, you know, for (INAUDIBLE) trade 12 to 16 times, trading below that historical range. So, you're are starting to get now down to trough levels where you're starting to bake in some significant bad news into Apple. OK, every day, the sun comes up and there's bad news in Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm.</p><p>IVES: So I think it's been just a massive string of bad news, if you've seen the last six weeks, but ultimately a lot it's self-inflicted. Because you will get cooked. Once they away took iPhone metric and transparency decreased, that set off the storm here and you've continued seeing through the suppliers.</p><p>LAYFIELD: So do you not buy the services' idea? That the service is going from 10 billion to 50 billion, and Apple's now serves as company. You still think it's a hardware company that is dependent upon that sale of the iPhones for the valuation.</p><p>IVES: Look, it's a services-led hardware company and we're talking about the 50 billion in services --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Correct. Yes.</p><p>IVES: -- in 2020. That -- from sum of the parts, we believe that's worth about 400 billion, that's service's business.</p><p>So, right here, you get in a core iPhone business, for 3 to 400 billion, but, nonetheless, it's a hardware iPhone business in the near term, 60 percent that's where it comes from. So, right now, that's going to rule the day which is why right now, the disappointing we've seen with 10Rs specifically added China, that's really been with the gut punch for Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you still like the stocks?</p><p>IVES: Look, we -- look, we continue -- we're not waving the white flag on Apple. We are buyers of Apple here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about Google?</p><p>IVES: Look, in our opinion right now, in large cap, we much rather own an Apple versus some of these other names.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>IVES: You know, in large cap, just given the valuation and given we know that there's a cycle there with regulatory risks with (INAUDIBLE) minimum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's Google on the hill today, so we'll see what happens with the Alphabet parent of Google, Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>IVES: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Daniel Ives joining us. Stay with FOX Business, we're taking you live to Sundar Pichai's testimony, begins at 10:00 a.m. Eastern today, join us and we will roll on that for you.</p><p>First, though, a major meeting today between President Trump and top Democrat leaders, with border wall funding at the Fore Front, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi headed to the White House.</p><p>Then, Nirvana smells like teen spirit, losing its crown as the most streamed song from 20th century, we'll tell you what tune knocked it off from the top spot, coming up, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th, your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Stocks are extending gains this morning. Take a look at Futures, indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning. We are expecting a big opening with the Dow Industrials up 160 points, that's two-thirds of one percent. S&amp;P 500 is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ up almost one percent, 60 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p>There is a run in technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major comeback yesterday, check this out. The Dow had been down 507 points, on the news out of the U.K., and at the close, ended up 34 points. Fractional gain but it was a wild one and the market came all the way off of the lows.</p><p>The NASDAQ was up 51 points. The market was initially hit as British Prime Minister Theresa May cancelled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. Now, spokesperson for May is reportedly saying that the government will bring the deal back for a vote by January 21st. All right, January 21.</p><p>In Europe this morning, rally there, as well, FT 100 up one and a quarter percent, 85 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and two-thirds percent, 78 points higher, DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 163 points higher right now, in Germany. Small action in Asia, overnight, as you can see, very fractional moves there, and it was a mixed story.</p><p>A new round of talks is underway. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talked to trade with China's vice premier on the telephone, last night. We are watching that. And I think that's one of the reasons this market has a firmer tone.</p><p>Then, America's farmers, in the spotlight, Congress is expected to pass a five-year $867 billion-dollar farm bill, the compromise bill leaving out (INAUDIBLE) work requirements for food stamps recipients. We'll have all the details, there.</p><p>Plus, the Moonves legacy, the CBS board meeting ahead of today's -- an annual shareholders meeting, we'll tell you what members of the board are reportedly concerned about on the Les Moonves exit.</p><p>And then, there's this, the Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, has lost its crown as the most steamed song from the 20th century, the tune that knocked it out, coming up, right here.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, and that is a shutdown showdown, President Trump is expected to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, today, at the White House.</p><p>They are trying to strike a deal on funding for the border wall. The Democratic leaders will reportedly offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall, that is a stark difference from the $5 billion, the President is requesting. The meeting comes ahead of the looming December 21st deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>I spoke with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" Sunday. He weighed in on advice for today's big meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer --</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: are going to be meeting with the President on Tuesday, to talk about the spending bill and the border wall funding. Why can't the Senate get on board with the President's border wall funding, sir?</p><p>GRAHAM: Look at the caravan, look at the charge against the border, look at the caravans that are to come, look at the holes in our border security, so here is the problem, you've got the Democratic leader to be in the House, calling border security, a wall component, immoral.</p><p>If I'm President Trump, Tuesday, I would tell Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer that we're going to build a wall where it makes sense. If I were the President, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding. I want the whole 5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.</p><p>1.6 is available to the President, he wants 5, and after the caravan, if you don't see the need for additional border security, you're just not paying much attention, so Mr. President, dig in, do not give in when it comes to the law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But isn't it the Senate who's stopping this? I mean, every time we ask congressman, they say it's passed. We've got the money in the House. It's the Senate.</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, you've got to have the speaker of the house who will be in charge next year, what about next year? So here's what's happening in the Senate, we need 60 votes to get 5 billion. If I were the president, I would tell the Democrats, I want $5 billion for wall security because for border security, including a wall, because we need it from the threats we're facing, this caravan and others to follow.</p><p>And I'd put DACA on the table. There are 700,000 young people who came here on the average age of 6, have got no place to go. They're in the DACA program, if I were the president, I'd say, I want two years of wall funding and I'll give legal status to the DACA recipients.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GRAHAM: That's good deal for the country.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, Retired General Jack Keane. General, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Your reaction --</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: to all of this, will the President get the money?</p><p>KEANE: Well, I don't know, because I'm not good at testing the temperature, you know, the Congress of the United States. I think, fundamentally, the wall is necessary. Take the politics out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: The border and customs people have been telling us for years, we've got 600 miles of border security right now, in terms of some kind of fencing. And as we have seen in recent television exposures --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: some of that is inadequate, so we've got to fix that. And then, we've got to build about 800 more miles of fencing or wall to provide some degree of security. And then, there's about -- you know, we've got about 2,500 miles of border, so we're not going to build it in all places, but we need in certain places, the funnel people in other place where the border control and customs people can be -- to deal with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: I mean, it is fundamentally a sovereignty issue, Maria. I think the President -- the strength of the argument is on his side, given what we have seen in the last few weeks, with people coming by the thousands, even though most of them are motivated in terms of economic opportunity, some of them are motivated because they're passing drugs and they're criminals, but the overall majority just want a better life.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, and we've got that. But, you know, other people that are standing in line by the thousands, in front of them, and they've got to get behind that line, and we've got to get some kind of control.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's an important meeting today, because, you know, the President has talked about striking deals with the Democrats on infrastructure, but they've been pretty -- you know, they've been saying, look, we're not giving you any more money for this wall beyond 1.3 billion.</p><p>It's going to be interesting to see how he can -- it's an early test of his ability to work with the Democrats on anything. But let's get to defense budget, because this is something I know you care about so much, the President has told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to submit a $750 billion budget proposal for fiscal 2020.</p><p>I spoke with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday, he weighed in on the border funding battle, as well as defense spending. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this all about getting the money for the President's border wall? Is that what this fight is about?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We need our borders, stronger, strong and secure, especially with the caravan and others. In the House version, we have five billion. The Senate version has 1.6, and what the President is saying is, I want a deal.</p><p>That's why Schumer has a process in this, but he's going to have Schumer come in. Now, Nancy Pelosi is in a different position. She's having a battle to become speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You have to have 218 votes on the floor, so that's January -- but we have to get this all done in the next two weeks. You know the type of new members she has, coming in. They're much more socialist progressive. They don't go to her office to visit her. They go to her office to join in the protest, so she has a challenge that she doesn't want to vote for anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She doesn't want anything done.</p><p>MCCARTHY: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She wants to be speaker.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there you go, General, she doesn't want to vote for anything, she wants to be speaker. She's not going to do anything different to rock the boat on her speakership. But the defense budget is basically already funded, but now, what's your take on 2020?</p><p>KEANE: Well, this is a huge thing that the President has done, because the Director of OMB, Mulvaney, tasked every single department in our government to take up five percent haircut cut to include defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: which would've stopped the Trump build-up, and what has happened here is, the chairmans of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have met with the President and said, Mr. President, if you do that, then the Trump build-up is going to stop and we're going to go right back to where we were, before you became president.</p><p>And so, he has decided, we're going to increase the defense budget, which is, I was on a commission for a year, the Commission on the Defense National Strategy, looking at this. And we believe that you need three to five percent increase, to account for two percent inflation increase, so you can grow the budget.</p><p>So, that is where we are, and that will be -- that will be argued with the Democrats who are going to control the House Armed Services Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's even for 2020, right? The $750 billion --</p><p>KEANE: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: for 2020? General, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, there. Coming up, shareholders shaken, a big meeting today at CBS, to talk about potential leaks associated with the Les Moonves scandal, we are on it, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Five Marines missing after a crash off of Japan. They've now been declared dead. Cheryl Casone with details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. Those five Marines went missing after a mid- air collision off the coast of Japan, south of Muroto Cape. There is the map for you on your screen. The U.S. Marine Corps has suspended its search after a refueling plane collided with the F-18 Hornet fighter jet late last week during regularly scheduled training. The weapon's system officer in that jet ejected, he survived; the pilot also ejected but was later pronounced dead.</p><p>Well, CBS board members are reportedly concerned about the legal ramifications of the investigation into Les Moonves' alleged sexual misconduct. Wall Street Journal reports they are worried that leaks could expose the networks to even more legal liability, some are calling for a probe into the source of these leaks. Amid all of this, folks, CBS shareholders are holding annual their annual meeting today; protestors expected outside to demand the company deny Moonves' $120 million severance payout.</p><p>Well, Universal Music Group has released its list of for the most streamed songs from the pre-streaming era. You know, the 70s, folks. And only one song reigns supreme.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FREDDIE MERCURY, VOCALIST, QUEEN: Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" the most streamed song from the 20th Century. It is also seen as spiking popularity, obviously, since the release of the Freddie Mercury biopic movie that came out last month, which was huge hit, by the way at the box officer. Here is the rest of top five: at number five, \"Take on Me\" by A-ha -- remember that one? Right? I love that we're all 80s kids here. Guns 'n Roses, has the next two spots with \"November Rain\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\" Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has been played more than 1.5 billion. And yes, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" despite being six minutes long, number one, 1.6 billion streams. I love that we all get each other in our musical taste.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love all of those songs.</p><p>CASONE: Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think I'm going to have \"Take on Me\" in my head all day, though, now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A-ha, of all bands, to make the top five. And \"November Rain,\" really, kind of one of the bottom, like, five songs ever recorded by G&amp;R. What about \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" or (INAUDIBLE), any of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, where was that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, take a break, when we come back, the finer things; why more people are investing in their money in fine arts? That's straight ahead. Wait until you see what we've got to show you next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, as we look at the stock market rallying this morning, we're also looking at art as an investment as the number of billionaires and wealthy individuals continues to grow. More and more are turn to fine art as a way to invest their money according to the 2017 Night Frank Luxury Investment Index, art was the most popular luxury investment ahead of assets like wine, coins and jewelry. Joining us right now is Fine Art Curator, Michael Witmer. Michael, it's good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL WITMER, FINE ART CURATOR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell us what's been happening over the last, what, couple of years in number of the number of billionaires investing their money in art?</p><p>WITMER: We're seeing more billionaires being created than ever before. We're seeing them being created in far fun places where we haven't seen billionaires before throughout Asia: China, India, and places like Malaysia, the Philippines which didn't have many billionaires. They're building their own museums, they're pushing up the prices. We will continue to see blue chip prices go through the roof because that's what they want for the walls of their museums. So, we're seeing the supply go down and demand go up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What kind of art are they most interested in?</p><p>WITMER: They seems to be interested in real museum pieces for -- especially French impressionism, early modern artist like Picasso, Mone, van Gogh. We will probably see prices of the good old (INAUDIBLE) start to go up again. And once we see those go up, there's no stopping them.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Is it (INAUDIBLE) independent. (INAUDIBLE) American billionaires buys different artist, a Da Vinci art or a Picasso for instance, compared to, say, Asian billionaires?</p><p>WITMER: It used to be that way. But now, we've seen a worldwide increase, drastic increase in museum attendance, more people are studying art history than ever before. If you look 26 years ago with the Louvre, there were 2.5 million visitors and they thought they would never get that high. Last year and the year before, it was just barely shy of 10 million visitors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>WITMER: Most major museums are seeing that. So, as a result, to answer your question, we're seeing the museums throughout the world, the billionaire collectors throughout the world now collecting the same thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love this story. I want to ask you about this mystery, though, in the art world. Last year, we saw the most expensive art sale on record. We talked about it on this program a lot, you came on the show to discuss it. This was Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi. It was bought by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $450 million. Now, the master piece has not been seen since its purchase last year. Scholars are worried about where it is, where is this painting, where do you think?</p><p>WITMER: At $450 million, that painting had its own armed guards and escorts everywhere it went. It was probably as safe as President Trump has ever been. It's not uncommon in the part of the world for the buyers to hang something in the living room, enjoy it for a little while, and then share it with the world. Also, because they're building beautiful new Louvre museum that is now opened, it's spectacular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In Saudi.</p><p>WITMER: Yes, and they're building more -- that's in Abu Dhabi, and they're building more museums throughout that region. So, they may be looking to make more acquisitions before they show everything. The idea that one 450 million-dollar Leonardo is not enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazing story. Yes, maybe it is in MBS's home?</p><p>WITMER: Could be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael, good to see you.</p><p>WITMER: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We will be right back. Google is in the hot seat. We're going to talk about a CEO Sundar Pichai headed to Capitol Hill to testify, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018121101cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY1-XH71-DXH2-600S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 11, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good morning,  ladies.  Thank you so much.  We will see you in a little bit.  Big day  today.  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 11th.  Your top stories right now  just before 6:00 a.m. on the EAST COAST.  Stocks are extending gains right  now, we are at the highs of the morning with a big rally underway.  Dow  Industrials set to open up this morning better than a hundred points, the  S&amp;P 500 is up 10, and the NASDAQ up 38 points, that's two-thirds of one  percent higher this morning.  </p><p> After a wild day yesterday on Wall Street, markets were volatile, climbing  from the lowest to the end of the day in positive territory.  Big rally  toward the end of the day, taking the market off of the lows.  The Dow had  been down better than 500 points after British Prime Minister Theresa May  delayed the vote on the deal to leave the European Union.  Then, by the  close, as you can see, markets reversed course.  Up 34 points at the close  on the Dow.  </p><p> Global markets this morning are also seeing a bit of a bounce, take a look  at FT-100 up better than one percent, 69 points higher, CAC Quarante in  Paris is up 71 points, one and a half percent higher, and the DAX Index in  Germany also higher by one and a half percent, that's a hundred and fifty- seven points higher this morning.  In Asia overnight, markets with little  change, as you can see there, very fractional moves and mixed.  Trade talks  are moving forward.  The U.S. and China holding a new round of negotiations  last night.  We have the very latest on where that stands.  </p><p> And coming together, President Trump set to meet with House Minority  Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and funding the border wall among top items on the  agenda, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will go to the White House.   Democrats reportedly ready to offer to $1.3 billion for the wall, but that  is the short of the President's $5 billion request.  Google's turn on the  hot seat today.  CEO Sundar Pichai's headed to Capitol Hill today.  He will  testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  FOX Business will bring you  that live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will take a look at what to expect  from his testimony this morning. </p><p> Then Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit losing its crown as the most  streamed song from the 20th century.  We'll tell you what tune knocked it  off the top spot, all that coming up this morning.  All those stories  coming up.  Joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, and Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John Layfield.  It's great to see you  this morning.  </p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND BEYOND SPORT GLOBAL AMBASSADOR:   It's great to see you.  Going to be a crazy week.  With the Brexit, its  potential government shutdown, this is going to be nuts. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Nice to see the green though in  the market this morning, really.  Positive reaction to some of this trade  news and especially in Europe, all in the green after yesterday's Brexit. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see how it closes.  The market's volatility has  been just unreal. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  It's a market that's  trading off headlines, that's trading off commentary, from somebody,  anybody, everybody, coming out of the White House, and I think that that's  going to be the case.  Other than the Federal Reserve meeting in the month  of December, that's really the only, like, hardcore piece of news that we  have coming up that we -- that we know about. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We talked yesterday about the fact that the President of  France, Macron, has not been seen in the face of all of these riots.  We  did hear from him yesterday, Dagen.  What did do you think? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He is pledging tax cuts and minimum wage hikes to placate  protesters, but, again, I want to point out that the -- kind of the kickoff  to these yellow-vest protests was a gas tax hike to push his environmental  agenda, and I think that that is an actually -- it's an honest move because  that is what it does take if you want to broadly reduce emissions and push  an environmentalist agenda.  It's -- everybody bears the cost of it.  That  gas tax hike has completely gone away, but the protestors have still been  out four weekends in a row so I -- I'm curious to see if this really does  kind of soothe the unrest. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they say -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- he's out of touch, which is the -- which is the criticism.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  But I need to give Nile Gardiner credit.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I used the phrase \"swanning about the globe while (INAUDIBLE)  capital city is burning.  Nile used that phrase over the weekend.  So,  credit to Nile on that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he was great when he joined us to -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- navigate all of this.  We got a big show this morning.   Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, Ohio Congressman and  House Judiciary Committee Member, Jim Jordan is here.  We're going to talk  with the Congressman about that Google hearing among other things.  Plus  Jim Comey, lots to talk about with Jim Jordan.  Michigan Congressman and  House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Debbie Dingell, is with us this  morning.  Congresswoman Dingell has a lot to say about General Motors.   Plus the Chairman and CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg Brown, is with us  this morning.  He's turned that company around.  </p><p> And Former British Parliament Member Euro Pacific Capital Senior Economic  Consultant, John Browne, is here as well.  Plus FOX News Senior Strategic  Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane joins us as well.  Don't  miss a moment of it.  We got a big three hours coming up.  We kick it off  right here with this top story, and that is all of these swings in the  market.  Checking Futures right now, we're expecting a pretty strong  opening for today's trading.  Dow Industrials right now up a hundred and  twelve points, a half a percent higher after a wild day yesterday when the  Dow slid to session lows down better than 500 points after British Prime  Minister Theresa May announced a delay of the exit vote, Britain leaving  European Union.</p><p> But look at that chart, markets reverse in course, as the session wore on  and as you can see, after the lows hit at about 11:15 a.m. in the morning,  things slowly but surely came back only to end higher. When we were down at  11:15 market better than 500 points.  Market was briefly in correction  territory down 20 percent from the high, that means.  Joining us right now,  CIO, EventShares CIO Ben Phillips.  And Ben, it is good to have you on the  program this morning.  </p><p> BEN PHILLIPS, CIO, EVENTSHARES:  Thanks for having me, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What a market.  How are you doing with all this volatility?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, we've done some things in portfolio raise cash actually on  the Fed pop.  I guess that was a couple of Wednesdays ago.  So, we had a  big day up, markets were up about two percent.  We actually raised cash to  17 percent in portfolio. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.  Big number. </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  So, it was a meaningful move.  You know, I think the  thought was get a little more defensive.  We were pretty skeptical on  anything positive coming out of G20.  And so after we actually saw that  over the weekend, we started to look -- even get a little more defensive. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But longer term, has anything changed in terms of structural,  you know, performance for this market?  Look At the backdrop -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of growth expectations, higher rates, has anything  specifically changed that you really want to shift your allocation and hold  it in cash and just like -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, I think we have to realize that we are late cycle, and  there's going to be more late-cycle activity.  The Fed is pumping the  brakes and what that means is the rate-sensitive sectors are going to see  some of that, you know, giveback and that's what we're seeing.  I think  it's normal to see this type of activity towards the end of the cycle as  the Feds starts its heightening cycle.  So, you know, they said don't fight  the Fed for the past 10 years effectively, don't fight the Feds still, you  know.  They're tightening for a reason, that's going to have implications  on markets.  </p><p> BELL:  One trend that we've seen though on these days, these mornings when  you're up like this by a nice amount -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BELL:  -- we've seen that pop, initial pop, sold into the end of the day  and we end the day -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  -- at the lows, do you expect that today?  When can that trend turn  around? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes, you know, I hear the question.  It's tough to call it a  day-to-day move obviously.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  But I -- you know, I talked to people about a potential rally,  you know, a Santa rally, or even a January rally, which is somewhat  typical.  People are looking to fade, looking to sell into it.  So, I think  that's going to be a trend we're going to see here.  There's been a  rotation that's occurred at the hedge funds where they've derisked.   They've brought down leverage and now we're at a situation where they still  have a little bit more to go, I think.  They're still long tech, they're  still long momentum, so they still have some unwinding of that trade to do.   So, if they're actually thinking the cycle's over, or it's close to the  end, the -- that rotation's going to continue. </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yesterday, we had all talks about Brexit, the week before, it  was all about G20.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  If you take out the geopolitical events and you trade only on  the market, what would the market be doing right now? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Well, that's tough.  It's tough.  I mean all we do is connect  the geopolitical events -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Right.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  -- to the market.  So, to say what would happen if there weren't  is -- I mean I think the market would be stronger.  I think, you know,  trade -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I guess my question is -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- are we headed for a recession, are we headed for a slowdown?   Would this market still be selling off even into a Christmas rally?  Which  looks to be a great Christmas retail season -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Yes.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  -- but people wonder, is this is the last hurrah?  What's your  view?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I think if we remove the geopolitical, we could see a rally  here.  We -- I think we should see a rally here.  Growth -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you're not expecting a growth slowdown?  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  No.  What I think is causing it is the confidence crisis right  now.  We've seen China trade actually slowing some supply chains, causing  some drag on growth across the world.  So, that's happening.  Now, if there  is a true pause and we start seeing constructive discussions between U.S.  And China, we could see that actually, you know, reverse course in the  market. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In fact, we have a new round of trade talks that we are  reporting this morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade  Representative Robert Lighthizer, holding a call last night with their  Chinese counterparts, reportedly discussing agricultural purchases, changes  to China's fundamental economic policies, according to the Wall Street  Journal, and this comes amid heightened tensions over the arrest of Huawei  CFO.  She's still waiting to find out whether she will be released on bail.   The decision could come today.  So, this is all intertwined.  </p><p> We did hear -- as soon as he came back from Argentina, Dagen, that the  President said China was going to buy all these agricultural products,  remember?  $1.3 trillion -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- was the number. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because of the trade fight that we've gotten into with China.   And it's a two-party fight, it's not a one-party fight, and it's really  hurt farmers.  Farmers have gotten multibillion dollar bailout from the  Federal government to help them out.  That will be good news.  But I would  caution that there needs to be one voice, while they -- while the U.S. goes  through these trade talks, there needs to be one voice on this, and I would  say it would be the President of the United States.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think investors have become accustomed to the way the  President communicates.  People can call it what they want, but that's who  he is -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- as Donald Trump, President of the United States.  I think  that this is a moment where a lot of these talking heads in the WHITE HOUSE  need to stay off television.  And I said that yesterday about Peter  Navarro.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, again, there needs to be one voice and clearly there's been  fighting within the White House over time between Lighthizer, and Navarro,  and Mnuchin, and maybe even Larry Kudlow.  So, just let the President talk  about it.  That's it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apparently, they did have this call last night.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did that change opinions in your view on Wall Street in terms  of where we are in this negotiation? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  You know, I think it's positive to see that we're back at the  table.  Since July -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  -- really, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments weren't really  at the table at a senior level.  It was -- it was barely even junior  staffers having conversations.  So, it's positive to see that.  I think we  saw Trump and Xi go back home after the G20.  While there wasn't a joint  communication, they did go back home and they both tried to spend it  domestically.  \"Hey, we got some things done.  There is some progress.\"  We  took that as a positive cue.  If you look at one silver lining from the  G20, I think that's it, that they said \"We have to get something done  here.\"  They're looking at the markets, both of them.  Their respective  domestic markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you do think we're seeing this rally today because of this  new talk last night, right? </p><p> BELL:  Yes, I definitely think that the rally we're seeing -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what's pushing -- </p><p> BELL:  -- this morning is because of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right now.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  We also have another push for tax reform, Ben.  So what about that?   I mean House Ways and Means Committee Chairman -- </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I don't think that's what's driving markets today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Because Kevin Brady is retooling this tax cuts 2.0 right  now.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's trying to secure more Republican votes, the bill delayed  several healthcare taxes that allows expecting parents to create 529 plans  for their unborn children.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think that has an impact in any way, right? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  No, I think that the plan he released, I think it was the  Wednesday after Thanksgiving or the week after Thanksgiving was more  bipartisan-looking and I think that the revisions are more partisan.  And  so it seems pretty lame ducky some politicking at this point in time.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And speaking of politics, I'll throw this in.  I'm hearing this  more and more from investors.  They're really waiting for the Mueller  report to come out, and they point to the two months before the Ken Starr  report came out in 1998, which was in September of that year, granted that  was the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management at that time as well, so  it's hard to separate the two, but in the two months, between mid-July and  the Starr report coming out in September, the S&amp;P fell almost 20 percent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  About -- more than 90 percent.  Granted the market made back all  that loss by the end of November, but this is -- people are standing back  and now waiting as more and more filings come out of the Mueller Team, out  of the U.S. Attorney in the -- for the Southern District of NEW YORK on  Friday, that's becoming a focus as well.  And I -- Gary B. talked about it  over the weekend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's one of three really important things that will  probably give us a sense of what's going to happen in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Number one, who did the Democrats put out there to go against  President Trump?  Number two, how's the economy doing?  We'll see if we are  in a growth slowdown come 2020, and number three, the Mueller report. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What comes out of Mueller?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to add one more thing.  I think the markets -- and I know  you'll agree with me, are -- you're getting a little bit of a lift moving  into the week because we did get an inversion of the yield curve between  the two-year and the 10-year to where, you know, if the shorter rates are  higher, that indicates the recession it has for the last 50 years, we  didn't get that last week, and I think that there was a bit of relief among  investors (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because as it was coming close, the two-year -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- and the 10-year markets were selling off. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  As narrow as it was since 2007, but we didn't get that  inversion and -- </p><p> BELL:  And the reporting on the Fed potentially walking back, maybe taking  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BELL:  -- more of a dovish tone obviously played well into that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Do you buy into that?  Fed's not going to raise as many  as people think right now? </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I -- yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ray Dalio, by the way, told us he's not -- they're not going to  be able to do it three times next year.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  I don't think so.  I mean, we look at -- if trade continues like  this, that is a drag on growth, and even if it's just discussions, it is  dragging growth, it's dragging confidence, so if we see this continue, I  don't think the Fed's hiking.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ben, it's good to have you on the show.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ben Phillips joining us there.  Coming up,  Macron gives in, the French President pledging tax cuts now, and a minimum  wage increase following weeks of dangerous protests where more than a  billion dollars of damage was done.  Then Google is on the hill today, CEO  Sundar Pichai set to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee on  alleged bias against conservatives.  We're going to cover that live and  we'll talk about it next.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More drama across the pond after the U.K.  Government postponed today's scheduled vote on its plan to leave the  European Union.  Cheryl Casone with the headlines right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So many moving parts to this  story, Maria.  Good morning to you.  Prime Minister Theresa May is now in  Brussels after she postponed today's scheduled vote on Britain's plan to  leave the E.U.  May plans to meet with European leaders in order to signal  concessions on the deal, but the E.U. is already ruling out any further  negotiations.  And May could face a challenge to her leadership for rivals  in the Conservative party.  Well, Lord of the Rings actor, Andy Serkis,  reviving his old Gollum character to poke fun at U.K. Prime Minister  Theresa May and her precious Brexit deal, look. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDRY SERKIS:  They told us, precious, they hates the deal.  All of them  hates it.  They wants a People's vote.  People's vote.\" </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Sorry.  Serkis released the video over the weekend with the title  \"Leaked Footage from Inside Number 10 Downing Street.\"  The video has been  viewed, as you can imagine, more than a million times, it released ahead of  the planned parliamentary vote, which, again, is looking like it's going to  be pretty funny.  All right.  </p><p> Let's move to France.  Embattled President Emmanuel Macron promising to cut  taxes and increase the minimum wage as he addressed the nation last night.   His first public comments following four weeks of violent protests over his  economic agenda.  Macron admitting he is partially responsible for the  demonstrations led the by yellow-vest protestors who took to the streets to  oppose higher fuel taxes now they're government changes and been improving  the economy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator):  And I want to  see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries, and this is why I'm  ordering an end of year bonus for all employees without any tax. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  Last week, Macron suspended a hike in the fuel tax.   Maria, those are your headlines. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot of drama coming out.  And I think, Dagen, you made  the point yesterday, \"Well, if you're in Britain, you could look across the  channel and thank God you're not in France right now.\"  What were -- what  were your thoughts of what we heard last night about -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which they think all the time.  I lived in Britain and they  don't really love the French.  They love the food, but not the people who  cook it because they -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I think Europe's falling apart.  I've heard they've already got  the 48 letters signed and that they're really to be delivered at any point.   Nobody wants the Prime Minister role right now, but I think that the Brexit  ends up being probably a hard Brexit, which, if that happens, I think Italy  drops out of the E.U. as well, and the E.U. dissolves. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that -- this is a really important point that you're  making here.  I mean you said Europe is falling apart.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we know what's going on in France, we know the situation in  Britain, then there's Italy.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  That's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the budget issues in Italy.  You're going to have an  election in Germany soon.  I mean -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  And the big issue here is -- with -- I'm sorry to cut you off,  the big issue with Italy is if -- England has to -- U.K. has to stay in.   It will tell Italy they have to stay in as well.  If Italy -- if it sees  that England gets out, they could get out as well, which kills the E.U. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  By the way, there is something cultural going on that has always  been in place that Italy, they -- that they feel like it's important to  preserve their national culture and their national identity, and it's the  same in France, and it's the same in Britain not having a bunch of, quite  frankly, elitist snots in Brussels telling these countries what to do.  And  I think that it's been -- Macron said last night, this is this outrage by  the yellow-vest who's been 40 years in the making, he's trying to take some  responsibility for it.  But when you are one of those elitist snots, then  your people will turn against you.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  At least they're unelected elitist snots.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's the problem, right?  That makes it better somehow?  </p><p> BELL:  This is also all happening when the economy over there is also  slowing down, too, but from lower Levels than we are seeing here, so -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Germany's contracting. </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was some (INAUDIBLE) yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't you think this eventually, you know, impacts the United  States though?  I mean, you know, we're talking about Europe falling apart.   This is a major story.  And it of course is going to impact how we see  growth in the U.S.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, it already has.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Donald J. Trump is evidence of what was going on here  in the United States, the divide between the elitist in our cities, and our  coastal areas -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and the -- and the rural -- and rural America.  People --  their politicians were not listening to people in the Hinterlands. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  All right.  We'll take a short break.   When we come back, there is real frustration at CBS.  Shareholders are  meeting today to talk about the possible legal risks over leaks associated  to the Les Moonves probe.  We've got those details.  And then we're  searching for answers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is testifying today on  Capitol Hill over the search giant's alleged bias against Conservatives.   We'll take you there.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tech is taking the hill.  Google CEO Sundar  Pichai set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee later this  morning.  The Google CEO expected to answer questions on the company's  business practices, including its handling of user data, and potential  political bias.  Joining us right now to talk more about that.  First,  though, here's what House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told me on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FEATURES\" about this hearing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got the CEO of Google coming in to testify, what are you  looking to get out of that? </p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, this is something  you have, too, that we've looked at this for quite some time because  technology affects so much of our life.  Two-thirds of every adult American  gets their news from the internet. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Yes.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  But there -- there's no other company that has a greater control  over the internet on searches than Google, and Google has not been coming  to any of our hearing, whereas Twitter, Facebook, and others.  Ninety  percent of all internet searches goes through Google.  That's not news.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we going to see a regulation?  Are we going to see a bill  come to the floor about bigger power? </p><p> MCCARTHY:  This is why we're having the hearings.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  What do we need to protect?  What do we need to stop the bias,  what do we need for competition. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Managing Director of Equity Research at  Wedbush Securities, Daniel Ives.  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p> DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you comes out of this?  And as an investor, what do we  need to focus on in terms of these technology companies? </p><p> IVES:  Well, because they're investors' regulation, and that continues to  be the sort of big threat for big tech.  You know, I think right here, you  know, Google's really been the last one to go in front of Congress.  So, I  think really in terms of how they navigate the data privacy, but I think  there's also a big focus on China because if you look at China, especially  with everything going on, you know, Google, how they're looking at  potentially getting into China from a search perspective, their view there,  as well as just the overall privacy, and that's really going to be front  and center here.  </p><p> But big techs' watching this, because, you know, this continues to be an  overhang on the space from a regulatory perspective. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Speaking about China, I mean Google decided to work with  China with its in A.I. and yet it said that it didn't want to work with the  Pentagon, it didn't want to be anywhere near the U.S. Government, and yet  tries to have this national score, individual scores for people where  they're watching you at all times, spying on you, and then at the end of  the year, you get a score and that may dictate if you can get on a plane,  get on a train, get a mortgage, I mean it's incredible.  And Google is  obviously enabling that. </p><p> IVES:  Well, because -- and that's why, like, they find themselves in the  crosshairs, because the thing about what's happening in broader with China,  you look at 5G, you look at this battle between U.S. and China across tech.   You're going to see more and more.  U.S. and tech are going to be battling,  you know, specifically on China when it comes to 5G, A.I., and Google is  sort of the center of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> BELL:  And with regulation, regulation in the U.S. is very different from  China, very different from Europe, where they just passed the GDPR, General  Data Protection Regulation, this year.  How do these companies navigate  those waters?  What kind of expense does that cause and how do they get  from point A to being able to deal with all that? </p><p> IVES:  Yes.  I mean with GDPR, I think that was when there was a big fear  going into that in May.  I think so far, you know, that's when it's been  pretty contained, and that's going to continue to be sort of a unicorn in  terms Of how much regulation you see overseas.  But, look, no doubt, I mean  look from an investor perspective, just given what we're seeing in the  market, the last thing you want to sort of come out of left field today --  and this also has given -- we saw yesterday with Apple getting Qualcomm and  China, you know, so that's the broader backdrop of tech where some of these  things were never factored into valuations.  Now you're seeing it.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  How do you trade Apple?  I've known Apple for years.  Obviously  got a big profit, it's had a great run-up, but right now, it's trading on  geopolitical news.  These, tariffs, as they kick in, could hurt the global  supply chain significantly.  Do you stay away from Apple completely here or  do you find some type of value here at a lower valuation?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And before you answer, let me just say that a Chinese court is  now ordering Apple to stop selling older iPhone models -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- after it found that the company violated two patents held by  Qualcomm. </p><p> IVES:  Yes, that was a major gut punch.  That really came out of left field  because if you go to Qualcomm-Apple situation, it's gone on for a long  time, you look what's happening in China, China is going to be 20, 25  percent of the incremental growth for Apple.  So, if you look at the  tariffs, you will get the situation right.  We continue to believe that  there's value in Apple here where it's trading, but no doubt, I mean if the  90-day period comes and tariffs get up to that 25 percent, and potentially  on iPhones, you know, that really could be a backbreaker for Apple. </p><p> But right here, we continue to be buying that name from a valuation just  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean the stocks now were at their lowest earnings  multiples in years because they've taken such a beating, so what are they  trading in now? </p><p> IVES:  Yes.  I mean if you look right now, I mean look, $15.00 of earnings  for Apple?  OK.  You're talking about so that's now trading, you know, for  (INAUDIBLE) trade 12 to 16 times, trading below that historical range.  So,  you're are starting to get now down to trough levels where you're starting  to bake in some significant bad news into Apple.  OK, every day, the sun  comes up and there's bad news in Apple. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p> IVES:  So I think it's been just a massive string of bad news, if you've  seen the last six weeks, but ultimately a lot it's self-inflicted.  Because  you will get cooked.  Once they away took iPhone metric and transparency  decreased, that set off the storm here and you've continued seeing through  the suppliers. </p><p> LAYFIELD:  So do you not buy the services' idea?  That the service is going  from 10 billion to 50 billion, and Apple's now serves as company.  You  still think it's a hardware company that is dependent upon that sale of the  iPhones for the valuation.  </p><p> IVES:  Look, it's a services-led hardware company and we're talking about  the 50 billion in services -- </p><p> LAYFIELD:  Correct.  Yes.  </p><p> IVES:  -- in 2020.  That -- from sum of the parts, we believe that's worth  about 400 billion, that's service's business.</p><p> So, right here, you get in a core iPhone business, for 3 to 400 billion,  but, nonetheless, it's a hardware iPhone business in the near term, 60  percent that's where it comes from.  So, right now, that's going to rule  the day which is why right now, the disappointing we've seen with 10Rs  specifically added China, that's really been with the gut punch for Apple.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you still like the stocks?</p><p> IVES:  Look, we -- look, we continue -- we're not waving the white flag on  Apple.  We are buyers of Apple here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about Google?</p><p> IVES:  Look, in our opinion right now, in large cap, we much rather own an  Apple versus some of these other names.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> IVES:  You know, in large cap, just given the valuation and given we know  that there's a cycle there with regulatory risks with (INAUDIBLE) minimum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's Google on the hill today, so we'll see what happens with  the Alphabet parent of Google, Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p> IVES:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Daniel Ives joining us.  Stay with FOX  Business, we're taking you live to Sundar Pichai's testimony, begins at  10:00 a.m. Eastern today, join us and we will roll on that for you.</p><p> First, though, a major meeting today between President Trump and top  Democrat leaders, with border wall funding at the Fore Front, Chuck Schumer  and Nancy Pelosi headed to the White House.</p><p> Then, Nirvana smells like teen spirit, losing its crown as the most  streamed song from 20th century, we'll tell you what tune knocked it off  from the top spot, coming up, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 11th,  your top stories right now, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Stocks are extending gains this morning.  Take a look at Futures,  indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning.  We are expecting  a big opening with the Dow Industrials up 160 points, that's two-thirds of  one percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ up almost one  percent, 60 points higher on the NASDAQ.</p><p> There is a run in technology stocks helping the major indices stage a major  comeback yesterday, check this out.  The Dow had been down 507 points, on  the news out of the U.K., and at the close, ended up 34 points.  Fractional  gain but it was a wild one and the market came all the way off of the lows.</p><p> The NASDAQ was up 51 points.  The market was initially hit as British Prime  Minister Theresa May cancelled the vote on the U.K.'s exit from the  European Union.  Now, spokesperson for May is reportedly saying that the  government will bring the deal back for a vote by January 21st.  All right,  January 21.</p><p> In Europe this morning, rally there, as well, FT 100 up one and a quarter  percent, 85 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and two-thirds  percent, 78 points higher, DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent, 163  points higher right now, in Germany.  Small action in Asia, overnight, as  you can see, very fractional moves there, and it was a mixed story.</p><p> A new round of talks is underway.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer talked to trade with China's  vice premier on the telephone, last night.  We are watching that.  And I  think that's one of the reasons this market has a firmer tone.</p><p> Then, America's farmers, in the spotlight, Congress is expected to pass a  five-year $867 billion-dollar farm bill, the compromise bill leaving out  (INAUDIBLE) work requirements for food stamps recipients.  We'll have all  the details, there.</p><p> Plus, the Moonves legacy, the CBS board meeting ahead of today's -- an  annual shareholders meeting, we'll tell you what members of the board are  reportedly concerned about on the Les Moonves exit.</p><p> And then, there's this, the Nirvana song, Smells Like Teen Spirit, has lost  its crown as the most steamed song from the 20th century, the tune that  knocked it out, coming up, right here.</p><p> All those stories coming up, this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story  this half an hour, and that is a shutdown showdown, President Trump is  expected to meet with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, today, at the White House.</p><p> They are trying to strike a deal on funding for the border wall.  The  Democratic leaders will reportedly offer $1.3 billion to fund the wall,  that is a stark difference from the $5 billion, the President is  requesting.  The meeting comes ahead of the looming December 21st deadline  to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p> I spoke with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" Sunday.  He weighed in on advice for today's big meeting.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  are going to be meeting with the President on Tuesday, to talk  about the spending bill and the border wall funding.  Why can't the Senate  get on board with the President's border wall funding, sir?</p><p> GRAHAM:  Look at the caravan, look at the charge against the border, look  at the caravans that are to come, look at the holes in our border security,  so here is the problem, you've got the Democratic leader to be in the  House, calling border security, a wall component, immoral.</p><p> If I'm President Trump, Tuesday, I would tell Nancy Pelosi and Chuck  Schumer that we're going to build a wall where it makes sense.  If I were  the President, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding.   I want the whole 5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer.</p><p> 1.6 is available to the President, he wants 5, and after the caravan, if  you don't see the need for additional border security, you're just not  paying much attention, so Mr. President, dig in, do not give in when it  comes to the law.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But isn't it the Senate who's stopping this?  I mean, every  time we ask congressman, they say it's passed.  We've got the money in the  House.  It's the Senate.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, you've got to have the speaker of the house who will be in  charge next year, what about next year?  So here's what's happening in the  Senate, we need 60 votes to get 5 billion.  If I were the president, I  would tell the Democrats, I want $5 billion for wall security because for  border security, including a wall, because we need it from the threats  we're facing, this caravan and others to follow.</p><p> And I'd put DACA on the table.  There are 700,000 young people who came  here on the average age of 6, have got no place to go.  They're in the DACA  program, if I were the president, I'd say, I want two years of wall funding  and I'll give legal status to the DACA recipients.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> GRAHAM:  That's good deal for the country.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst,  Retired General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see you this morning.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Your reaction -- </p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see  you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  to all of this, will the President get the money?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know, because I'm not good at testing the  temperature, you know, the Congress of the United States.  I think,  fundamentally, the wall is necessary.  Take the politics out of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  The border and customs people have been telling us for years, we've  got 600 miles of border security right now, in terms of some kind of  fencing.  And as we have seen in recent television exposures -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  some of that is inadequate, so we've got to fix that.  And then,  we've got to build about 800 more miles of fencing or wall to provide some  degree of security.  And then, there's about -- you know, we've got about  2,500 miles of border, so we're not going to build it in all places, but we  need in certain places, the funnel people in other place where the border  control and customs people can be -- to deal with this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  I mean, it is fundamentally a sovereignty issue, Maria.  I think  the President -- the strength of the argument is on his side, given what we  have seen in the last few weeks, with people coming by the thousands, even  though most of them are motivated in terms of economic opportunity, some of  them are motivated because they're passing drugs and they're criminals, but  the overall majority just want a better life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, and we've got that.  But, you know, other people that are  standing in line by the thousands, in front of them, and they've got to get  behind that line, and we've got to get some kind of control.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's an important meeting today, because, you know, the  President has talked about striking deals with the Democrats on  infrastructure, but they've been pretty -- you know, they've been saying,  look, we're not giving you any more money for this wall beyond 1.3 billion.</p><p> It's going to be interesting to see how he can -- it's an early test of his  ability to work with the Democrats on anything.  But let's get to defense  budget, because this is something I know you care about so much, the  President has told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to submit a $750 billion  budget proposal for fiscal 2020.</p><p> I spoke with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday, he weighed in on the  border funding battle, as well as defense spending.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this all about getting the money for the President's border  wall?  Is that what this fight is about?</p><p> MCCARTHY:  We need our borders, stronger, strong and secure, especially  with the caravan and others.  In the House version, we have five billion.   The Senate version has 1.6, and what the President is saying is, I want a  deal.</p><p> That's why Schumer has a process in this, but he's going to have Schumer  come in.  Now, Nancy Pelosi is in a different position.  She's having a  battle to become speaker.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  You have to have 218 votes on the floor, so that's January --  but we have to get this all done in the next two weeks.  You know the type  of new members she has, coming in.  They're much more socialist  progressive.  They don't go to her office to visit her.  They go to her  office to join in the protest, so she has a challenge that she doesn't want  to vote for anything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  She doesn't want anything done.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  She wants to be speaker.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  Exactly.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there you go, General, she doesn't want to vote for  anything, she wants to be speaker.  She's not going to do anything  different to rock the boat on her speakership.  But the defense budget is  basically already funded, but now, what's your take on 2020?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, this is a huge thing that the President has done, because the  Director of OMB, Mulvaney, tasked every single department in our government  to take up five percent haircut cut to include defense -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  which would've stopped the Trump build-up, and what has happened  here is, the chairmans of the House and Senate Armed Services Committee and  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have met with the President and said, Mr.  President, if you do that, then the Trump build-up is going to stop and  we're going to go right back to where we were, before you became president.</p><p> And so, he has decided, we're going to increase the defense budget, which  is, I was on a commission for a year, the Commission on the Defense  National Strategy, looking at this.  And we believe that you need three to  five percent increase, to account for two percent inflation increase, so  you can grow the budget.</p><p> So, that is where we are, and that will be -- that will be argued with the  Democrats who are going to control the House Armed Services Committee.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's even for 2020, right?  The $750 billion -- </p><p> KEANE:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  for 2020?  General, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks  so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, shareholders shaken, a  big meeting today at CBS, to talk about potential leaks associated with the  Les Moonves scandal, we are on it, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Five Marines missing after a crash off of Japan.   They've now been declared dead.  Cheryl Casone with details and headlines  now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Those five Marines went missing after a mid- air collision off the coast of Japan, south of Muroto Cape.  There is the  map for you on your screen.  The U.S. Marine Corps has suspended its search  after a refueling plane collided with the F-18 Hornet fighter jet late last  week during regularly scheduled training.  The weapon's system officer in  that jet ejected, he survived; the pilot also ejected but was later  pronounced dead.  </p><p> Well, CBS board members are reportedly concerned about the legal  ramifications of the investigation into Les Moonves' alleged sexual  misconduct.  Wall Street Journal reports they are worried that leaks could  expose the networks to even more legal liability, some are calling for a  probe into the source of these leaks.  Amid all of this, folks, CBS  shareholders are holding annual their annual meeting today; protestors  expected outside to demand the company deny Moonves' $120 million severance  payout.  </p><p> Well, Universal Music Group has released its list of for the most streamed  songs from the pre-streaming era.  You know, the 70s, folks.  And only one  song reigns supreme.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> FREDDIE MERCURY, VOCALIST, QUEEN:  Any way the wind blows doesn't really  matter to me, to me.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" the most streamed song from the 20th Century.   It is also seen as spiking popularity, obviously, since the release of the  Freddie Mercury biopic movie that came out last month, which was huge hit,  by the way at the box officer.  Here is the rest of top five: at number  five, \"Take on Me\" by A-ha -- remember that one?  Right?  I love that we're  all 80s kids here.  Guns 'n Roses, has the next two spots with \"November  Rain\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\"  Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has  been played more than 1.5 billion.  And yes, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" despite  being six minutes long, number one, 1.6 billion streams.  I love that we  all get each other in our musical taste. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love all of those songs.  </p><p> CASONE:  Me too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think I'm going to have \"Take on Me\" in my head all day,  though, now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A-ha, of all bands, to make the top five.  And \"November Rain,\"  really, kind of one of the bottom, like, five songs ever recorded by G&amp;R.   What about \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" or (INAUDIBLE), any of that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, where was that?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, take a break, when we come back, the finer  things; why more people are investing in their money in fine arts?  That's  straight ahead.  Wait until you see what we've got to show you next up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, as we look at the stock market rallying  this morning, we're also looking at art as an investment as the number of  billionaires and wealthy individuals continues to grow.  More and more are  turn to fine art as a way to invest their money according to the 2017 Night  Frank Luxury Investment Index, art was the most popular luxury investment  ahead of assets like wine, coins and jewelry.  Joining us right now is Fine  Art Curator, Michael Witmer.  Michael, it's good to see you, thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> MICHAEL WITMER, FINE ART CURATOR:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, tell us what's been happening over the last, what, couple  of years in number of the number of billionaires investing their money in  art?  </p><p> WITMER:  We're seeing more billionaires being created than ever before.   We're seeing them being created in far fun places where we haven't seen  billionaires before throughout Asia: China, India, and places like  Malaysia, the Philippines which didn't have many billionaires.  They're  building their own museums, they're pushing up the prices.  We will  continue to see blue chip prices go through the roof because that's what  they want for the walls of their museums.  So, we're seeing the supply go  down and demand go up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What kind of art are they most interested in?  </p><p> WITMER:  They seems to be interested in real museum pieces for --  especially French impressionism, early modern artist like Picasso, Mone,  van Gogh.  We will probably see prices of the good old (INAUDIBLE) start to  go up again.  And once we see those go up, there's no stopping them.  </p><p> PHILLIPS:  Is it (INAUDIBLE) independent.  (INAUDIBLE) American  billionaires buys different artist, a Da Vinci art or a Picasso for  instance, compared to, say, Asian billionaires?  </p><p> WITMER:  It used to be that way.  But now, we've seen a worldwide increase,  drastic increase in museum attendance, more people are studying art history  than ever before.  If you look 26 years ago with the Louvre, there were 2.5  million visitors and they thought they would never get that high.  Last  year and the year before, it was just barely shy of 10 million visitors.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> WITMER:  Most major museums are seeing that.  So, as a result, to answer  your question, we're seeing the museums throughout the world, the  billionaire collectors throughout the world now collecting the same thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love this story.  I want to ask you about this mystery,  though, in the art world.  Last year, we saw the most expensive art sale on  record.  We talked about it on this program a lot, you came on the show to  discuss it.  This was Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi.  It was bought  by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $450 million.  Now,  the master piece has not been seen since its purchase last year.  Scholars  are worried about where it is, where is this painting, where do you think?  </p><p> WITMER:  At $450 million, that painting had its own armed guards and  escorts everywhere it went.  It was probably as safe as President Trump has  ever been.  It's not uncommon in the part of the world for the buyers to  hang something in the living room, enjoy it for a little while, and then  share it with the world.  Also, because they're building beautiful new  Louvre museum that is now opened, it's spectacular.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In Saudi.  </p><p> WITMER:  Yes, and they're building more -- that's in Abu Dhabi, and they're  building more museums throughout that region.  So, they may be looking to  make more acquisitions before they show everything.  The idea that one 450  million-dollar Leonardo is not enough.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amazing story.  Yes, maybe it is in MBS's home?  </p><p> WITMER:  Could be.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael, good to see you.</p><p> WITMER:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We will be right back.  Google is in the  hot seat.  We're going to talk about a CEO Sundar Pichai headed to Capitol  Hill to testify, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's as if the FBI or the Internal Revenue Service had to give an advanced heads-up to entities they were investigating, the DoL employees say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A longtime DoL employee not authorized to speak publicly described the policy as a \"giveaway to government contractors\", adding that \"transparency\" was a misnomer: \"The objective of this directive is to try to weaken [DoL] enforcement.\"</p><p>The policy was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">announced</url> in September 2018 by DoL's contract compliance director, Craig Leen, and the acting assistant secretary for policy, Jonathan Berry - both Trump appointees - but prompted opposition from some in the agency. It is one of many examples of the DoL's new leadership eroding existing regulations meant to support workers' rights, said Laura Padin, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. The Trump administration       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">suspended</url> an equal pay initiative, moved to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">roll back</url> a child labor rule, and has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">dismantled</url> anti-discrimination protections for LGBT workers.</p><p>\"You have an agency that's supposed to be the watchdog, and they are not doing their job,\" said Patricia Shiu, who served as the DoL's director of federal contract compliance under Obama. \"This is what federal contractors want.\"</p><p>Industry groups have long pushed for these kinds of changes that would make it harder for the government to scrutinize their labor practices, said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center.</p><p>The changes could be particularly beneficial for Silicon Valley firms, which make hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars each yearby providing a range of software products and other services to federal agencies. The new directive effectively helps those tech corporations avoid scrutiny, labor experts warn, despite growing recognition that white men in tech make <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">higher salaries</url> than       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">women</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">minorities</url> doing equivalent work - in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">violation</url> of equal pay       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">laws</url>.</p><p>Under the Obama administration, the DoL repeatedly reported findings of pay gaps and other forms of systemic discrimination in Silicon Valley. A number of Silicon Valley companies have faced DoL investigations.</p><p>In the department's long-running case against Google, the DoL announced this week that in line with the \"transparency\" directive, it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">dropping</url> an appeal that could have forced Google to hand over specific employee salary data. The DoL in 2017       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">accused Google</url> of \"extreme\" discrimination against women across the company. Google denies the allegations. </p><p>Leen, the DoL compliance director , defended the decision to dismiss the appeal in the Google case, saying it was \"the most effective means of reaching final resolution with Google\". Because the DoL had already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">obtained a trove of records</url>, the case continues and it is unclear how the directive will affect the outcome. </p><p>But DoL insiders and former agency leaders say they fearthe \"transparency\" directive will be most detrimental to new investigations.</p><p>The directive is \"limiting the tools available to the agency to fulfill its mission\", said Janette Wipper, former regional director of the DoL contract compliance division. \"This directive doesn't address the interest of employees who work for federal contractors. It's transparency in one direction.\"</p><p>Under federal law, companies that do business with the US government agree to meet specific non-discrimination standards, enact proactive affirmative action plans, and allow the DoL to access salary records. The DoL's compliance investigations are a significant opportunity for regulators to push for pay equality on a large scale. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/Dir2018-08-ESQA508c.pdf\">estimated</url> 25% of US employees work for federal contractors.</p><p>The directive is ostensibly aimed at helping government contractors comply with the DoL's anti-discrimination audits by directing investigators to work more \"collaboratively\" with companies. But it in effect limits the scope of information the DoL can request during an investigation and creates new time constraints for those investigations. Most notably, when the DoL wants to access additional data during its inquiry, the directive stipulates that labor investigators must provide a \"summary of any preliminary indicators of discrimination\" to the company under investigation.</p><p>\"I don't see how you can perform a competent investigation about whether there are problems with the pay gap if you don't have the data,\" said Wendy Musell, a civil rights lawyer and chair of the California Employment Lawyers Association. \"This is one of the only mechanisms where we can ensure that our federal taxpayer dollars are not funding discriminatory employment practices.\"</p><p>\"The overall message is, 'We know that you're discriminating, and we are content to prevent regulators from catching you,'\" said one longtime DoL employee, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the directive.</p><p>\"It would tell the target of the investigation very early on the theory of the case,\" said the DoL employee added. \"They will be able to game the system.\" </p><p>A national DoL spokesperson said the agency remained \"committed to increasing compliance with the law\" for contractors, adding: \"The transparency directive ensures that contractors are made aware of [DoL]'s indicators of discrimination promptly in order to ensure that such discrimination is remedied sooner ... so that America's workers receive relief as quickly as possible when there are violations.\"</p><p>Since 2017, the DoL's contract compliance program recovered more than $44m from contractors with back pay and other awards for victims of discrimination, the spokesperson added. That includes financial relief for more than 22,000 workers and job applicants, she added.  </p><p>But Shiu, the former DoL director, said it appeared the department was taking credit for cases launched under the previous administration, and that she expected the new directive would prevent these kinds of payouts moving forward.</p><p>The department was misleading the public about the intent of the new policy, she added: \"If you don't want to enforce the law, don't enforce the law. But don't pretend you are doing it under the guise of 'transparency'.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51570689</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCJ-K0C1-F021-6022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1104\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, January 10th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jobs in America today. We are 90 minutes away from the December jobs report. Here's what we are expecting, 164,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of December. The unemployment rate holding steady at 3.5 percent. We have full coverage of this all-important read on the American economy. We will identify where the jobs are today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are higher this morning, pushing toward yet another record as we await the December report. Dow futures up 64, S&amp;P futures up nine, Nasdaq futures up 40.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow looking to cross the 29,000 threshold for the first time ever. Look at that, we're at 28,994 right now on the Dow. Yesterday, the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 all hit record high closes. Uncharted territory.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices this morning are higher. As you can see, fractional moves, Brexit, another step closer to reality. Britain's House of Commons approving a bill authorizing the country's departure from the European Union. This puts the U.K. on course for a January 31st exit from the European Union. DAX index in Germany is the best performer this morning in Europe, up 21 points, a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. Take a look. As you can see, the best performer there was Korea. The Kospi index up almost 1 percent.</p><p>2020 in focus.

Iran reportedly inviting Boeing to help investigate this week's deadly Ukrainian International Airways crash that killed 176 people aboard. And now Iran is denying shooting down that passenger jet after the U.S. said that intelligence supports the scenario that they, in fact, did shoot it down. At least 62 victims were from Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in on the investigation yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: This may well have been unintentional. This new information reinforces the need for a thorough investigation into this matter.</p><p>Canadians have questions and they deserve answers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is former National Security Council chief of staff, former CIA officer and Center for Security Policy president and CEO Fred Fleitz.</p><p>Fred, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>FRED FLEITZ, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL CHIEF OF STAFF: Hey, Maria. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think happened here?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, Maria, it's a terrible tragedy and I think it simply is a sign that when you use terrorism as part of state craft, terrible things are going to happen. This is something that Iran brought upon itself. It was apparently something done by miscalculation. And the Iranian government's going to have to own up for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But, I mean, they're denying it. Are we ever going to get to the bottom of it, Fred?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, I mean, this is just the way regimes like this go. They never tell the truth. They'll probably always deny it. But I think the evidence on what happened here is fairly apparent. There's actually video that's out right now of a missile apparently hitting this plane and you can see the explosion in the air. So the Iranian government can deny it as much as it wants. The facts are facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- go ahead, John, did you want to jump in?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, you know, my question here would be, the Iranian economy is performing horribly. It's one of the worst economies in the world right now. Supposedly it shrank by nearly 10 percent in 2019, expected to shrink yet again in 2020.</p><p>I mean there's got to be some threshold at which the Iranian government has no choice but to try to improve its standing with the international community, hoping to get these very restrictive sanctions eased somehow.</p><p>Do you think we're moving close to that point?</p><p>FLEITZ: That's an excellent point. President Trump's maximum pressure policy has put enormous pressure on the Iranian economy. And it's not just undermining support for their regime because of economic problems, it's led to anti-Iran protests in Lebanon, in Iraq and even in Syria. And the president's waiting for the time when the Iranian government is ready to do the right thing and start negotiations to end these sanctions, but in the meantime, he's going to keep the pressure up.</p><p>SMITH: Hey, Rob Smith here. I have a question.</p><p>So, do you think Iran is buying time, making this invitation for others to come help them sort of investigate what's going on here when all of the intelligence tells us what happened.</p><p>FLEITZ: I think the Iranian government is in denial. It's playing political games. It never tells the truth. It's always making idle threats against the United States and others. It continues to say it's complying with this nuclear deal, even though there's plenty of evidence it's been cheating on the agreement from the start.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FLEITZ: We just can't believe anything it said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this came up last night. The president holding a rally in Ohio, speaking out about the killing of Iran General Soleimani.</p><p>Listen to this. Got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As the leader of Iran's terrorist Quds force, Soleimani spread death, destruction and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad. And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi. We got there very, very quickly.</p><p>Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies. And not just the embassy in Baghdad. But we stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet, Fred, the -- Nancy Pelosi with her resolution vote last night in terms of limiting the president's powers in terms of dealing with such provocations.</p><p>FLEITZ: It's really a shame. I mean politics is supposed to end at water's edge and the president said he did not notify Congress about this sensitive military operation because he was worried about leaks. We have to face the reality that the national security debate has become poisoned by Trump derangement syndrome and, frankly, the real possibility of leaks. And I hate to say that. I know members and staff on the House Intelligence Committee. They really believe that Adam Schiff has been leaking. It's really a sad commentary that the president cannot get congressional buy-in for situations like this, operations like this in advance, but he has to keep the lives of American soldiers in mind. If he thinks Congress is going to leak, they simply don't deserve advanced notification of these operations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is extraordinary. I mean this is a moment in time when we've got serious situations unfolding and the president cannot trust the Congress not to leak. And they don't trust each other. They're not talking about it.</p><p>And, by the way, we haven't even had -- I don't think the Intel Committee has had a meeting, a hearing on Iran at all in the last year. I mean I don't know how many months it's been, but it's all about impeachment.</p><p>SMITH: You know, this is very unfortunate, and I think that we're at a moment here where, look, American security and operations and things of this nature, these are things that should be bipartisan. And we're in a point right now where it seems like everything is about political games --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>SMITH: Especially when it comes from the left. And I do not blame them at all for keeping the information about this attack away from the left because I do believe that they would have leaked it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were nodding when the president was talking just a minute ago --</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: About the anti-Benghazi.</p><p>SMITH: It is the anti-Benghazi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're an Iraq War veteran, Rob.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me why you were nodding.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I was nodding because it was just absolutely right. This is the anti-Benghazi. When you look at how quickly and how forcefully America reacted to this attack on the U.S. embassy, which was predicated also by the killing of an American contractor, which was also predicated before that by the killing of hundreds of American soldiers. And when you look at how quick and forceful the response was, it was the anti-Benghazi. We lost not a single American soldier during this entire process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So where does this go, Fred? What happens now?</p><p>FLEITZ: Well, I think the president took the right approach on Soleimani. I believe he's just simply going to stay the course concerning Iran. We have to see what's going to happen in Iraq, because the Iraqi prime minister asked the U.S. overnight to send a delegation to Iraq to discuss the withdrawal of American troops. I don't think that's going to happen. But, frankly, if the Iraqi government doesn't want us there, we should leave. I mean it's an enormous expenditure for our country and we're there to help the people of Iraq. But I don't think that that question has been settled yet.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: However, Fred, that -- because the narrative out of the left was immediately with the killing of a known terrorist, Soleimani, who had killed Americans, 608 American troops just in Iraq alone, the narrative was this is World War III. This is the -- we're going to lead to the loss of life with blood on President Trump's hands.</p><p>But, in fact, there's at least an equal likelihood that troops come home, rather than more troops going into the region, right?</p><p>FLEITZ: I think that's right. And it's really important to notice that this missile attack conducted by Iran, either it failed because the Iranians fired missiles that were not capable of hitting their targets or they were very accurate missiles that they designed not to hit the targets. And the reason for that is that they did not want to provoke a war and they were worried about how President Trump would respond.</p><p>He's a credible leader. He does not want to get into a war. But he will respond overwhelmingly if Americans are killed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, Fred, we will leave it there.</p><p>By the way, just to be clear, the Iranian investigation team says it will first seek to analyze the black boxes but it is willing to hand over the so-called black boxes to another country for analysis. They're talking about U.K., U.S., Ukraine, France, and Canada, to probe the -- what's behind the crash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There are Ukrainian -- there are Ukrainian individuals on the ground going to help with the investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fred, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you.</p><p>FLEITZ: Good to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fred Fleitz joining us there.</p><p>A quick break and then we are awaiting the December jobs reporting out in just under an hour and a half. We will have special coverage starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. We're identifying where the jobs are, where the wages are moving up the most.</p><p>And then production bonanza. Streaming taking content to a whole new level. We have the shocking number of shows produced, created in 2019. It's a big number.</p><p>And then watching your wallet. Tips to keep and improve your credit score ahead. Don't miss it. Back in a minute.</p><p>But first, border arrests falling. The Trump administration tackling illegal immigration. We are taking a look at that.</p><p>Plus, this guy could be arresting you.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. The man behind the Incredible Hulk headed into law enforcement. Details when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Another border wall gets the go-ahead.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on headlines now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, not without some controversy, Maria. A federal judge ruled in favor of the privately funded wall. Fisher Industries is going to build the barrier on land along the Rio Grande River in Texas. You may remember that Texas sued to stop construction over environment concerns.</p><p>And arrests at the border are actually on the decline we've just learned. Customs and Border Protection says more than 40,000 people were taken into custody last month, but that's down 72 percent from the height of the crisis back in May of 2019.</p><p>Well, Target's looking to take on Lululemon with a new activewear brand. It's called All In Motion. It's expected to bring in $1 billion in its first year. All In Motion emphasizes sustainably sourced clothing. This (INAUDIBLE) is going to be available on Target's website. That starts next Friday and in stores later this month. The Athleisure (ph) movement. We've talked about it.</p><p>And criminals beware, this could be the guy coming for you.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: I can't -- sorry.</p><p>That's the original Incredible Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno. Well, guess what, he's going to become a sheriff's deputy in Socorro County, New Mexico, in a special ceremony next week. The 68-year-old actor is no novice. He's previously served as a reserve deputy in Los Angeles. He was also, Maria, a volunteer over in Arizona.</p><p>I want to see Mark Ruffalo try to pull that one day, right? That's a real hulky man, that video.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He is also an icon for the hearing disabled because he lost most of his hearing when he was a child from an ear infection. And so he is -- he's really achieved a lot and is a great shining example for people who suffer from hearing loss.</p><p>SMITH: Wow, I didn't know that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific. Yes.</p><p>All right, we will take a break. We are waiting on jobs in America this morning. The December jobs report is out in just over an hour. We are previewing it when we come back. Where the jobs are coming up.</p><p>Then, banning cell phones. One state looks to take some drastic steps. That story just ahead.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>It is jobs Friday today. We are awaiting the December jobs report. The latest expectations show 164,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of December. The unemployment rate sticking to its 50-year low of 3.5 percent.</p><p>Joining us right now is Mahoney asset management CEO Ken Mahoney.</p><p>And, Ken, it is good to see you this morning.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Good to see you. Happy Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's priced into the market right now? Is it about 160,000? Do you think if we have a number much different than that markets move on this?</p><p>MAHONEY: I don't know. You know, the last couple of times I've been fortunate to be here on set and I took the over, OK? So I'm going to take the over -- I'm not going to jinx myself. I'm going to take the over 164,000 again because this is a job creation economy machine going on right now. If you look at business services, you look at healthcare, I mean just a number of jobs that are created, it's unbelievable. So I think it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but look at this market. What's priced in? I mean we hit more record highs yesterday.</p><p>MAHONEY: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're in unchartered territory. Dow Industrials about to hit 29,000.</p><p>MAHONEY: I think it all has to do with the Fed. Think about a year ago, right, the balance sheet was contracting about $60 billion a month. And here we are, a year later, expanding their balance sheet by about $100 billion per month. The last four months, $400 billion. That's a lot of liquidity sloshing around. So I think that's what's driving the markets right now. It's kind of a stealth QE so to speak, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that.</p><p>LONSKI: You know, that's what I think. You know, when you look at 2019, the market benefited enormously from this unexpected drop by interest rates. Short term rates, corporate bond yields, whatever.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: And this year, I don't think you're going to see a repeat of that decline by interest rates. If anything, there's a possibility they may be edging higher towards year's end. So we're leaning heavily on a recovery by profits growth.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: Where is that recovery going to come from?</p><p>MAHONEY: I don't know. I think it's also just, you know, kind of catching up with performance. I mean it's kind of being fear of left out of this market is one of the things that happens. So, you know, you look at human behavior, it's not emotional -- you know, it's emotional. It doesn't always set to logic and say, hey, you know what, here's our ratios, here's our future PEs and here are the numbers. When it starts going like this and you get behind the eight ball, the money's got to slosh into the market to keep up with the Joneses.</p><p>LONSKI: But I think it's imperative, you know, looking ahead to 2020, that you avoid a material decline by profits. If you get that, you're going to be in a lot of trouble, especially since the market's so richly valued. The higher your PE ratio, the more downside risk you have in case you run into some bad news.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right. And I think it's really interesting, the jobs report that we have here today, you know, it used to be this kind of tug of war, push and pull defense, like we were rooting for a good number now, but a few months ago we're not rooting for good numbers in the unemployment report because, what, here comes Fed Chair Powell with a bucket of cold water to throw on top of the markets, right? So here we have this kind of thing that we've got to root for a good number, a job creation number above 164,000, hopefully.</p><p>LONSKI: And the Fed has indicated that it's willing to tolerate --</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: A slightly faster rate of price inflation in order to compensate for the low inflation of the past.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: On the other hand, the bond market may not think the same way the Fed does. The bond market may become frightened if they see the Fed becoming more tolerant of faster price growth. And you could see a steepening of the yield curve, the 10-year trade yield could move up and --</p><p>MAHONEY: Right. That would definitely take money out of the market. Right. So the 10 year -- well, 180, 190. So if that were to lift and cause more competition in stocks, you're right, I mean we start having a ten year, two and a half, 3 percent. Yes, money's going to start sloshing back into bonds out of stocks. So that's probably the biggest risk this year is higher interest rates, especially in the 10 year (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fourteen -- 14 months ago the 10 year yield was at almost 3.25 percent.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right. Yes. Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So there's not any money -- money continued even this year to flood into fixed income. If anything, people are probably under allocated to stocks and over allocated to Treasuries, which look very -- look like that they have price risk in -- if you're buying at 1.85 percent on the 10 year.</p><p>SMITH: So you had noted that there were a lot of job gains in the healthcare sector last year. So what do you think some of those conversation that we're having about healthcare, coming from both sides actually, but mainly coming from the left, how do you think that that could affect the amount of jobs that we have in that sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to need a million new nurses coming up. I mean we're living longer. Wellness is a big --</p><p>MAHONEY: I mean the living (ph) demographics. There's someone turning 64 every 10 seconds basically, you know.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY: And, you're right, so the demographics are shifting. We really need healthcare. And the problem you're finding from employers is they can't get enough employees. So while this is a great job market, the pendulum swung almost too much the other way in saying, hey, we need more people. We need more people to hire.</p><p>SMITH: So they just don't have enough qualified people.</p><p>MAHONEY: By this point, yes. Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Interesting.</p><p>LONSKI: And you're going to have to keep people in the workforce longer.</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: I mean de facto the retirement age might become something like 72 years, looking into the future, if you're going to have a shortage of younger workers.</p><p>I think over the next 10 years, Americans age 65 and older growing by 1.8 million per year. On the other hand, Americans age 20 to 64 will be growing by roughly 400,000 people per year.</p><p>MAHONEY: Who's going to take care of us? Self-care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bottom line.</p><p>LONSKI: You have to take care of yourself. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bottom line. You went into work this morning, you want to buy stocks here or you want to hold off?</p><p>MAHONEY: Oh, yes, yes. Look, we like little pullbacks here. We are definitely extended. But, again, we're not really clearly -- we're not really over bought. (INAUDIBLE) that we use. My go-to all of last year being on set was XLK. Now, granted, that's Apple centric, that's Microsoft centric but it's worked very well. Again, we still like technology. We still like growth. We do believe money keeps going to the higher beta (ph) names as long as the Fed stays away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>LONSKI: And I think one thing to consider is that the rest of the world has lagged behind the United States. Maybe we'll get lucky in 2020 and the rest of the world is going to wake up and these companies you were speaking about, that have a lot of global exposure, will exceed expectations.</p><p>MAHONEY: That would be nice. We'd like to see some profit growth and not having the heavy lifting done by multiple expansions, like we saw last year. I'd like to see some earnings growth as well to support these prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, look, the fourth quarter earnings season kicks off next week, so --</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes, it's great. Right to the banks and -- yes, exactly, go right into it. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The banks reporting their fourth quarter next week.</p><p>John, later I want to get your expectations in terms of profit growth for the fourth quarter and all of 2020, by the way.</p><p>Ken, it's good to see you.</p><p>MAHONEY: OK, great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>Ken Mahoney joining us.</p><p>Be sure to join us in the 8:00 a.m. hour this morning. We've got all hands on deck. We're covering the December jobs report all hour long as we identify where the jobs are coming up.</p><p>But first, next week right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Monday, China's ready to sign on the dotted line.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, January 10th. Your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the button.</p><p>Jobs in America, the December jobs report out this morning, economists are looking for 164,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of December with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.5 percent.</p><p>Markets are higher this morning, pushing yet toward another record high as we await the jobs report. Take a look, we're in unchartered territory with the Dow Industrials up 50 points, headed toward 29,000. The S&amp;P is up seven and the NASDAQ this morning up 37. The Dow will be -- if it does rally, hitting 29,000 for the first time ever.</p><p>Yesterday the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 hit record high territory, all record highs closes as you can see there with that 211 point rally in the Dow yesterday and 74 points higher on the NASDAQ at 9,203. All-time high there. The S&amp;P posted its 117th record close under President Trump.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices have turned mixed the FT-100 is down six now, the CAC Quarante is up just one -- two points and the DAX Index in Germany is higher by 29, a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Brexit is another step closer to reality. Britain's House of Commons approving a bill authorizing the country's departure from the European Union. This puts the U.K. on course for a January 31st exit from the E.U.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. Take a look, best performer, Korea up almost one percent.</p><p>UAW president, Rory Gamble facing a corruption investigation just one month into his term. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. So Federal investigators are looking into financial dealings between Gamble and one of the UAW's highest paid vendors, specifically whether Gamble and an associate received kickbacks in exchange for contracts. Gamble calling the charges scurrilous and false.</p><p>Well, your genetic information from one DNA test is being used to develop drugs. 23andMe has licensed an antibody that it developed to treat inflammatory diseases to a Spanish drug maker. About 80 percent of the 10 million people who use their service consented to having their genetic material used for drug discovery, that's according to 23andMe.</p><p>And finally, cigarettes, alcohol and texting, yes. One lawmaker in Vermont is proposing a ban on cell phones for people under the age of get this, 21. Violators could face up to a year in jail, $1,000 fine or both.</p><p>State Senator John Rogers wrote the bill, he says cell phones are behind teenage driving deaths, bullying and radicalization. He says he doesn't expect the bill to pass.</p><p>Maria, you might want to point out here, you can be 18 years old to go fight for your country but no, you can't have a cell phone. Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point.</p><p>CASONE: Makes tons of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very good point, Cheryl.</p><p>All right, we want to turn to 2020, new Fox News polls this morning show that the Democratic advantage over President Trump has actually narrowed in potential head to head matchups according to Wisconsin voters.</p><p>Another poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden holding a large lead in South Carolina. He is ahead by 21 points as new comer Tom Steyer jumps into second place.</p><p>Joining me right now is Friess Associates founder, former Wall Street executive and multimillionaire, Foster Friess. And it's good to see you this morning, Foster. Happy New Year to you, sir.</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, FOUNDER, FRIESS ASSOCIATES: Well, I'm glad to be here but you know, I'm heading for 80 in a few months so I'm glad to be anywhere. So, good to have me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for you. What's your take on where we are in terms of the political story? You've got the Democrat getting ready for another debate, their last debate coming up before Iowa. What's your take in terms of where we are going into that?</p><p>FRIESS: Well, I think the big issue going forward is the issue of socialism versus capitalism. I think we have to define those terms a little bit better and not use those terms but instead say government control versus free markets.</p><p>And it's so easy to sell these young people who have been indoctrinated about the wonders of socialism by letting them know in Denmark which is a market economy. They have a 50-60 percent income tax, 25 percent sales tax and 180 percent excise tax on new cars.</p><p>And the trick is how do we let them see that our current government is so overextended it's almost Greece like? We want to -- go on the debt clock, and take off eight zeros off the government numbers, Maria and you'll see a household earning 35,000, spending 47,000 with a $230,000 credit card tab.</p><p>And then Elizabeth Warren wants to take all the private doctors, and private hospital. M.D. Anderson Sloan-Kettering those private dollars and dump it on top of that. So I think we're going to look forward to a real -- a real landslide come 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Elizabeth Warren also wants to have a wealth tax, right? I mean, let's talk about that because there's a new Reuters/Ipsos poll this morning that shows 64 percent of Americans are actually in favor of putting a wealth tax on the very rich.</p><p>FRIESS: Well, naturally, that would be -- if 64 percent of the people aren't wealthy, why not tax somebody else? And you know, someone has said, you know, Jesus was really a socialist, but it's anything but that.</p><p>If you remember the story about the talents where they're getting various talents and one guy went and hid in the bush and he got chastised for not being productive. So, I believe we must encourage our productive people.</p><p>And on my website, in FosterFriess.com, there's a wonderful cartoon about a minute long that shows an island where someone goes out with a fishing boat, starts getting more fish. And now the island prospers because of the entrepreneurial spirit of creating more productivity even though the disparity in incomes went up to five-fold.</p><p>Income inequality is what we cherish in America, it's the American dream. And I'm sort an example of that, I started out with $200 of accumulate pay from the army. And now I've been blessed, been able to give away $200 million and still have a few bucks left.</p><p>So I think you want to look to more Foster Friess' in the world and why tap -- why take my money away, you want to encourage people like me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right and you want to believe in the American dream that you could come from nothing and achieve great success and our audience really, we want people to understand what this wealth tax is. We've been calling it confiscation on this program because you can work your whole life, you know, save as much money as possible and then, if you get to a certain point, well, it will be confiscated because there is a wealth tax.</p><p>So, it's important to understand what a wealth tax is and that -- and that's a tax on everything. It could be your art, it could be your home, whatever it is that you have or you've accumulated over your -- over your life.</p><p>Another thing we say on this program is that money is mobile. So what are the implications of this? Because more business leaders are fleeing to places that are either no state tax or low taxes, states like Florida, Texas, for the warm weather and the tax relief.</p><p>Foster, you're coming to us this morning from Texas where there's no state income tax. We've got a graphic on screen showing all the states that have no state income tax. That's where you're seeing population growth.</p><p>FRIESS: Yes and I'm actually a resident of Wyoming which also doesn't have any tax.</p><p>And to your point, Maria, in Scandinavia when people are taxed based on their wealth, some of them don't have any income anymore and people have had to sell antiques and sell dishes and China in order to pay their tax. So, I just think it's part of the nastiness that's a crept into our society.</p><p>And let's look at the people who believe in free markets versus the people who believe in government control. And it lines up with Christianity Judeo- Christian values and with secularism. Most of people that don't want to have these kinds of government control are pretty much secular in spirit.</p><p>And Dennis Prager warned when some of his Jewish friends were concerned about Christmas celebrations in government run schools. He says, look, don't discourage that. The biggest threat that we have to America is secularism and that's the fastest growing religion probably in America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes but Foster, look, Michael Bloomberg is a billionaire, 2020 Democratic candidate and he wants to raise taxes. You know, yesterday he rolled out his economic plan, this week rather, promising to raise the minimum wage and steer more kids to college.</p><p>Your reaction to what you're hearing from Michael Bloomberg. Does he have a shot in this -- in this election to take down Donald Trump?</p><p>FRIESS: He does not have a prayer. And they're going to play his tape where he decides we can tax people for drinking big sodas and that hits the little guys. I don't care if the little guy has to pay more taxes, as long as we get him from -- get him more healthy and he has the classy government, I'm better than the rest of you because I'm successful and I'm going to tell you how to lead your life.</p><p>And I think what's exciting about America is you and I decide how we're going to lead our lives. And we have to fight for that, because truly the young people at these colleges have just been mesmerized.</p><p>In fact, I encourage you to see a film called \"No Safe Spaces\", it's doing extremely well, one of the highest producing documentaries. And Dennis Prager and his friend Carolla I believe his name, as they go around and showing what is happening with the lack of freedom of speech from campus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I heard that's terrific. I actually did hear a lot about that.</p><p>Foster, real quick, because you are so knowledgeable about policy. Are you considering getting into politics? Are you going to run for Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi's open seat in the Senate?</p><p>FRIESS: Well, you know, Maria, I was late getting into the Governor's race, there are 119 days ahead of time and I wound up winning the most Republican votes before the Democratic crossovers which are possible in Wyoming, wiped me out. So I'm a late starter. I'm going to hold my cards close to my vest. And one day I might just pop into it and another time I'm not because we have Cynthia Lummis and Liz Cheney were a remarkable women. Wyoming is a state that loves women. We are the first state to have women suffrage women voting well before we became a state. So there's going to be some good representation, whoever it is, but I'll let you know a little later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, that sounds like a yes but we're going to watching you, Foster. And I like that about women. It's good to see you this morning, sir. Thank you.</p><p>FRIESS: Love you, Maria. Keep up your good work. You're a real national treasure. God bless you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I so appreciate it. Right back at you, Foster Friess joining us. We so appreciate you Foster Friess joining us.</p><p>Meanwhile, T.V. producers making more shows than ever. Some are calling it peak T.V.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton has more on what this means for the future of the entertainment industry. Deirdre, these numbers are incredible.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: They are incredible. U.S. T.V. industry producing a 532 shows in 2019, that's seven percent more than in 2018. There is more to come.</p><p>Now, the man who is known as the mayor of T.V., F.X.'s CEO, John Landgraf, he spoke yesterday at an event. He said basically there's too much content being produced and, quote, the danger is that everything becomes junk food.</p><p>He was particularly critical of tech companies that back shows financially without really needing to make money on them. Those in the room heard that as a shot against Netflix.</p><p>He pointed out that over the past decade, 18 sees HBO has released 19 percent of the shows on critics' top 10 list, F.X. second at 18 percent, Netflix he pointed out came in fifth place with 10 percent worth noting though. Then Netflix only started producing original content with \"House of Cards\", if you count that as the launch in 2013, so even less than a decade ago.</p><p>But new streaming competitors coming online this year, Comcast, NBC Universal's Peacock, AT&amp;T's HBO Max, so that's going to have originals from the namesake channel. Also Warner Bros. Studios, Looney Tunes, Cartoon Network, Peacock including back episodes of \"The Office\" and \"Cheers\" as well as originals. There's going to be ads on that service that will say there will also be an ad-free paid service to launch concurrently.</p><p>Bottom line is this, Maria, industry execs are spending on content, money is flowing and most say the numbers are higher because the stakes are higher.</p><p>If you look at the 52-week returns for these stocks, you can see Apple well outperforming perhaps an unfair comparison because Apple T.V. Plus is obviously far from being its only business or even its top five revenue producers. But what's clear is it will be a few years before we know which bets paid off. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, Apple up 100 percent, maybe more than just T.V., right, up 101 percent on Apple.</p><p>BOLTON: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. I don't know how this can continue or sustain all those shows and all the billions that Netflix and all are spending.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, that's exactly his point. And it's going to take a few years before we really see which bets paid off. So probably a lot of smiles when the score card comes in and a lot of tears, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point. Deirdre, great to see you. Thanks so much. Deirdre Bolton joining us.</p><p>Coming up, watching your wallet, Americans' credit scores are rising, how yours can too. We're going to take a look.</p><p>And then asking anyone for a buck? Millennials having no shame asking for random wedding handouts, the new trend coming up. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching your wallet, credit scores are soaring, America's average credit score in 2019 reached an all-time high of 706 according to FICO.</p><p>Our next guest knows how to keep those scores climbing. Joining us right now is CreditCards.com industry analyst, Ted Rossman. Ted, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TED ROSSMAN, INDUSTRY ANALYST, CREDITCARDS.COM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us some of the best ways to accumulate credit and why you need to get a good score.</p><p>ROSSMAN: The number one factor is paying your bills on time. So do that every time. That part is more of a marathon. Something you can do quickly is to lower your credit utilization ratio. This is part of the second biggest factor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Explain what that is.</p><p>ROSSMAN: So that is how much credit you're using divided by your total credit limits.</p><p>So what people don't realize is that even if you pay your credit cards in full every month and you should, you may still have a high ratio which is hurting your score. Let's say you make $4,000 of charges throughout the month. You have a $5,000 limit. That's an 80 percent ratio. That's really high. We want you to keep it below 30 percent if you can, below 10 percent would be even better.</p><p>So the solution, regardless of where you are on the credit or income spectrum, make an extra payment mid-month, knock that ratio down before the statement generates. That's going to help your score.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: So if I came to you and I said Ted, what is the number one thing that I can do to get my score up right now, what's the first thing you'd tell me to do?</p><p>ROSSMAN: That's what I would do is lower your credit utilization ratio, that's very actionable. Some of these other things like paying your bills on time, great habit. You should do it. It's going to take time. The utilization ratio, lowering that will help you immediately.</p><p>Another one, sign up for Experian Boost. This is a new experimental program. It's really geared towards people that have low credit, maybe no credit. That's a big deal with young adults these days. Establishing credit is hard.</p><p>So Experian Boost looks at things that don't traditionally count as credit. Cell phone payments, utility payments. With your permission, they're going to look at your bank account. If you're making those payments on time, that can help your score. They say the average improvement is 13 points.</p><p>SMITH: Does that cost any money?</p><p>ROSSMAN: It does not and it's instant. So I would say look into that if your score is below 700, let's say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are some of the popular credit card offers in 2020? Because most people don't realize, I mean, that credit card rates are so high. I mean, you've got rock bottom rates elsewhere and yet a credit card company can charge, what, 19 percent?</p><p>ROSSMAN: Yes, the average is about 17 percent if you have good credit, about 25 percent if you have bad credit.</p><p>A very popular card is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. And this one's been in the news this week because they just raised their annual fee from $450 to $550. I know it sounds steep, but this card is really beloved by many, especially millennial young professional urban types.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why?</p><p>ROSSMAN: It appeals to travelers. So they give you a $300 a year travel credit. You get into a lot of airport lounges for free. There's other perks. Some of the new ones they introduced this week to go along with the higher fee are a $60.00 door dash credit, free Lyft Pink membership which gives you discounts and priority access at airports.</p><p>It's all about the experience these days. Some of the best credit cards are really tapping into people's love of travel, dining, ongoing value.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS GROUP: Ted, what I want to know is you're in the consumer credit card industry. Do you have any feeling as to whether or not consumer credit quality is getting better, worse or holding the same?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good question. Real quick.</p><p>ROSSMAN: We see credit scores going up. People are keeping up with their bills. Delinquencies are low. They're not getting ahead though. Two thirds of credit card debtors owe at least as much now as they have over the past decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good sign for the economy by the way.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ted, it's great to get your insights.</p><p>ROSSMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ted Rossman. We'll be right back. Jobs Friday coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now the buzz stories, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making a buzz, creating some controversy as well this morning. Animal rights group PETA blasting AOC for apparently buying a purebred French bulldog instead of rescuing a dog from a shelter. AOC introduced the pet to her Twitter followers. Just a sweet dog but we know, Dagen that we like rescue dogs.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Rescuing an animal and adopting one rather than buying one is completely nonpartisan. That I don't -- I like tweets all the time from Keith Olbermann because he is a huge advocate for rescuing animals. All day long every day, he post dogs that are in shelters that are on 24 hour kill list. And I will like them over and over again.</p><p>Every day in this country, 2,000 cats and dogs that would make perfect family pets are euthanized. 2,000 every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an unbelievable number.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Please do not go out and buy a dog, particularly one from a pet store. I walk by a pet store and I literally sounded like Yosemite Sam yesterday, grumbling expletives under my breath, because those are animals that are raised in puppy mills. And it's just -- it's tragic what these animals go through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why you have two rescues, Charlie and Ramon and I have a rescue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dusty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's Charlie and Ramon, your dogs. And there's my Dusty girl. Dusty is --</p><p>And you know what? She's so sweet, my Dusty, she knows that I rescued her. The rescue dogs, I think they know and they're so grateful and I love her.</p><p>SMITH: You guys -- I mean, am I the only one that think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Baby Dusty.</p><p>SMITH: Am I the only one that thinks that this is maybe a case of Woke Olympics gone wild here? Because it's like -- I mean, when AOC isn't woke enough, I mean it kind of -- you know, gives -- it gives you a little pause.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'm the furthest thing from woke. And I just -- at every turn, I will advocate for rescuing an animal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And not going out and buying one. It's not about shame, it's just about, she's in a position where she could really turn the tide and get more people out there in shelters. I wish she'd done that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. And a big thank you to Petco Foundation. That's where I found my Dusty and she's wonderful.</p><p>OK, how about this? Something old, something new, something borrowed and some charity to pay for it? Millennials are looking to pay for their weddings, seeking random cash donations, according to a survey by jeweler Jean Dousset.</p><p>In addition, one in five couples ask for donations to their honeymoon funds instead of actual gifts. What do you think?</p><p>SMITH: I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't buy the engagement ring and then you can pay for the wedding.</p><p>SMITH: I think it's the tackiest thing I've ever heard of. I got married about 2-1/2 years ago, I would not even think about asking people to pay for the wedding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you have a big wedding?</p><p>SMITH: 50 people, so pretty small.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just small.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then we get the jobs numbers coming out next hour, all hands on deck. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020011002cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-2WG1-JB20-G0B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

View original post here[2]. Shortly before Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin held his crypto-fearmongering press conference, CoinTelegraph's Kollen Post reports [3]that a drafted bill entitled 'Keep Big Tech out of Finance' has surfaced online, allegedly deriving from within the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The document's metadata dates it July 12. Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act Discussion Draft[4] The bill's provenance is unconfirmed, but crypto news site The Blockquotes[5]an inside source as saying it is with the Financial Services Committee. The document reads:'A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.'The alleged bill goes on to define 'a large platform utility' as a tech company that earns annual global revenues in excess of $25 billion. Given that Libra is scheduled for hearings before the Senate Banking Committee onJuly 16and with the House Financial Services Committee onJuly 17, this bill seems designed to preempt congressional authority to take decisive action on the issue of Libra. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2019-07-15_6-28-41.jpg?itok=pMa6YqMCimage\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2019-07-15_6-28-41.jpg?itok=pMa6YqMCimage</url> courtesy of CoinTelegraph[6] In fact, as Reuters reports[7], the legislation proposes to impose a $1 million fine daily upon any firm that violates its proposed rules.  Libra has attracted commentary and criticism from many corners. Chair of the Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters initiated the congressional hearings on Libra on June 18 by calling for a moratorium on the project. As Cointelegraphreported[8]at the time, Representative Waters wrote:'Given the company's troubled past, I am requesting that Facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action'The night of July 11, US President Donald Trumptweeted[9]similar concerns about the lawfulness of crypto usage, expressing opposition to Libra, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole, instead promoting the continued dominance of the U.S. dollar. Reuters [10]nonetheless anticipates that 'pro-innovation' Republicans will put their muscle behind blocking such a move, and that the bill could face yet steeper resistance should it pass the lower chamber and be debated in the U.S. Senate.

Lots to get to today, including new battles in the stay-at-home tech wars, as I mentioned there, the Slack CEO, Stewart Butterfield will discuss the fight for supremacy in your home office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is also a slack in the stocks premarket, too. We're taking back some of yesterday's gains. Actually, look, we've flipped in the last 20 or 30 minutes or so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NASDAQ staging a dramatic bounce from correction territory to close-up some 2.7 percent yesterday, led by Apple, Microsoft and Tesla. It's certainly a correction deflection otherwise known as buying on dips, as we discussed yesterday.</p><p>The index gains masking the full blow in economically sensitive sectors, recovery stocks like airlines. It's just another illustration that the sheer dominance of these indices by the tech names, but also, I think, too, the ongoing uncertainties and challenges ahead.</p><p>On that note as I mentioned, too, data today showing a further 884,000 Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits last week. It's the second straight week though below one million people, but there is a caveat and we'll explain why in a moment.</p><p>It's also small comfort. We are more than six months into this crisis with no agreement in U.S. Congress to provide additional help. The Senate voting on its so-called skinny stimulus bill today. There's no chance that it passes.</p><p>We'll also be asking whether businesses themselves can do more to help workers like paying a living wage, for example. The CEO of Gravity Payments tried it. He'll join later to discuss some surprising results.</p><p>Lots coming up. Let's get to the drivers.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us now. Paul, it is tough not to get a bit glazed eyes when we see these numbers every week, but it's millions and millions of Americans, 29 million plus by the latest count two weeks ago, still claiming some form of support.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, when you look at the numbers in aggregate, Julia, it is continuing to be frightening. Obviously, you point out the 29 million number. There's obviously well more than 10 million still filing for continuing jobless claims.</p><p>So even though that 880,000 or so number that we had for just this past week is below the somewhat magical one million number of people filing claims, it's hard to get too excited. And as you alluded to, there's also the revisions in the numbers, people are now looking at the non-seasonally adjusted numbers for jobless claims and that makes it a little more difficult to compare apples to apples to some of the previous numbers that we had seen in the past couple of weeks and months, because of this change that's been made to the dataset.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And I was just looking through some of the details there, too, the continuing claims, the numbers where people who are still getting benefits actually rose rather than fell in the data, what? A week and a half ago.</p><p>So there's a warning sign in there perhaps, too. But I do want to bring it back to what we're seeing for stock markets, in particular exactly what we were discussing yesterday, the broader shifts in the overall market is determined by the tech names.</p><p>You don't really get a sense when you look at the aggregate what's going on for those so-called recovery stocks and we saw that again yesterday.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it is pretty astonishing, Julia, that some of the quote- unquote \"recovery stocks\" have fallen back again because investors are still infatuated with tech after the brief dip. I have a story that's going to be going up on CNN Business later today that talks about how the market cap weighting on the S&amp;P because it is so heavily concentrated in those big tech names, the broader market is up about five percent this year, which is a pretty good year, all things notwithstanding. But that's when you factor in the market cap weighting.</p><p>If you look at the individual companies in the S&amp;P 500 and you do it equally weighted, the index is down nearly five percent for the year and nearly 300 of the companies in the index are in the red for the year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow.</p><p>LA MONICA: So it's really accurate to say that this whole market is rallying, it's a case, again, of the haves and the have have-nots and the haves continue to be Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's so funny, you and I always say the stock market is not the economy, but in terms of the haves and the have-nots, that's a great illustration of what's going on for the underlying economy as well and the widening effect of the wealthiest and the poorest here.</p><p>Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, to a stunning admission directly from President Trump that he purposely downplayed the threat from coronavirus, which has now killed more than 190,000. That admission came in a recorded interview with legendary journalist Bob Woodward for his latest book. And as Joe Johns reports, the White House is struggling to manage the fallout.</p><p>[09:05:16]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Trump, in his own words, admitting on tape that he understood just how dangerous the coronavirus could be. The revelation from a series of recorded interviews for journalist, Bob Woodward's new book, \"Rage.\"</p><p>In early February, Trump privately told Woodward the disease was deadlier than the flu, weeks before the first confirmed coronavirus- related death in the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, the touch -- you don't have to touch things, right? But the air, you just breathe the air, and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than your - you know, even your strenuous flus.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): But even 19 days later, here is what the President said to the public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP (on camera): That's a little bit like the flu. It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for, and we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): By mid-March, Trump admitted privately he was downplaying the coronavirus.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down.</p><p>BOB WOODWARD, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Yes, sir.</p><p>TRUMP: Because I don't want to create a panic.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS: And despite the President's repeated claims, like this one last month about the effects of the disease on children --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If you look at children, I mean, they're able to throw it off very easily. Their immune systems are very, very strong. They're very powerful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): Trump told Woodward months earlier that the coronavirus wasn't only harmful to the elderly.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Now it's turning out, it's not just old people, Bob. Just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It's not just old -- older people.</p><p>WOODWARD: Yes, exactly.</p><p>TRUMP: Young people, too. Plenty of young people.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): The White House denied the allegations from the book, even after the recordings were released.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president has never lied to the American public on COVID. The President has been very -- the President was expressing calm and his actions reflect that.</p><p>The President never downplayed the virus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): Hours later, the President responded to Woodward's book himself and defended his handling of the pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, the fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don't want people to be frightened. I don't want to create panic, as you say. And certainly, I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): Trump's defense, the same day the United States confirmed COVID-19 death toll topped 190,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, a grim milestone the President says he prevented from being even worse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: So I think if we didn't do what we did, we would have had millions of people die.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): In an interview with CNN, Joe Biden slammed Trump's leadership during the pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's disgusting. We learned this on a day that 100 -- we turned 190,000 Americans dead, and he knew this?</p><p>He waved a white flag. He walked away. He didn't do a damn thing. Think about it. Think about what he did not do. And it's almost criminal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): The book reports some of Trump's top officials also questioned his abilities. Woodward writing former Defense Secretary, James Mattis called the President \"dangerous\" and \"unfit for office.\"</p><p>And Dr. Anthony Fauci said Trump's \"attention span is like a minus number\" and \"his sole purpose is to get re-elected.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I don't really want to get involved in the kind of stuff -- that is very distracting to the kind of things that I'm trying to do and that we're all trying to do with this outbreak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): And as racial injustice has fueled protests and unrest across the country and is taking center stage as an election issue, Trump dismissed concerns about black Americans' frustration.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOODWARD: Do you have any sense that that privilege has isolated and put you in a cave, to a certain extent, as it put me, and I think, lots of white, privileged people in a cave, and that we have to work our way out of that to understand the anger and the pain, particularly black people feel in this country? Do you --</p><p>TRUMP: No. You -- you really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you, wow. No, I don't feel that at all!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, let's move on. Little appetite for Yum China in Hong Kong today as the shares had their debut. They ended down more than five percent, following a $2 billion cash raise for the fast food giant. Selina Wang is in Hong Kong.</p><p>Selina, what do we think happened here? I mean, it was a tough session overall in the Asia session, a bit of IPO here or indigestion or was this story specific? There's plenty of challenges for them with the COVID virus going around clearly?</p><p>SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Julia, it certainly bucks this trend of those recent secondary listings in Hong Kong, but these Chinese companies really popping on that first day of trade.</p><p>As you mentioned, Yum China actually dropping as much as 6.3 percent on its first day of trade. This is the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in China. Compare that in sharp contrast to NetEase and jd.com, which recently listed in Hong Kong and sharply bounced on the first day of trade.</p><p>[09:10:23]</p><p>WANG: Now, there are a number of factors at play here. I spoke to the Managing Director at China Renaissance and he said that timing is a big reason why this happened.</p><p>Hong Kong Exchange has this rule where there's a five-day waiting period between when you set the price of the shares and the day when they actually trade. Unfortunately, for Yum, the markets turned negative during that time period.</p><p>Another reason is the business model, which you alluded to earlier. Unlike jd.com and NetEase, which are these fast-growing technology companies, Yum is a restaurant operator and it was hit very hard by the coronavirus pandemic. It operates some 10,000 restaurants across China, and at one point, they had to close more than one-third of those stores.</p><p>Even though they are pretty much all back, nearly all back up and running at this point, the profit and sales are still under pressure as restaurants around the world grapple with these social distancing measures. But Yum does have the benefit of being located in China, which is the first major economy to reopen.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, you make some great points there. The timing is so important when you have five days of market moves in either direction, then you would expect an adjustment when they guys start trading.</p><p>Selina, we have to leave it there, but thank you so much for that. Some smart analysis, Selina Wang.</p><p>All right, these are some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>A massive fire raging at the Port of Beirut. The Lebanese Army says it is happening at an oil and tires warehouse. It comes, of course, just one month after a devastating explosion at the port killed nearly 200 people and injured thousands of others.</p><p>CNN's Arwa Damon joins us live. Arwa, any idea how this fire started?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, Julia. At this stage we don't know and there's nothing official that's being said. Bearing in mind, too, that they're still trying to get those flames under control.</p><p>But one thing without a doubt is that this fire caused mass widespread panic. I mean, people haven't even begun to psychologically recover, never mind, you know, physically or be able to return to their homes from that first massive explosion that took place just over a month ago.</p><p>And I was talking to some of the team members of my charity who were on the ground in the destroyed neighborhoods still running our medical tent, and they were describing sheer terror, because when people down there began seeing the smoke rising, it caused them to start to flee just as quickly as possible.</p><p>They were saying that the Army that was down there, people that were down there, NGOs that were down there, workers on buildings were jumping down off of them just trying to get out of the area because their initial reaction was, this is going to be another similar explosion that's going to be taking place. I mean, it re-traumatized them incredibly severely, and understandably so.</p><p>And now there is a lot of still ongoing widespread anger. And once again, the government is nowhere to be seen. You're not hearing government officials coming out and reassuring people that, you know, this is not going to lead to another explosion similar to the one that we saw in the beginning of August.</p><p>There's no one out there who is really reassuring a population that, as I was saying, is already very severely traumatized. And also remember that just a few days ago, it was announced that another four tons of ammonium nitrate were found at the Beirut Port.</p><p>So, again, people's fears are very, very understandable. There is little to no faith in the government at this stage. People really feel as if they have been left to their own devices. A lot of people who lost their homes, who you will talk to when you ask them, as I've been asking a number of people who I know, how they feel about what's happening, they will tell you that they have a sense of complete and total, utter despair.</p><p>They are at a loss as to how it is that they can even begin to move on with their lives. And now you have something like this, again, the cause of these fires raging right now in the Beirut Port are as of yet unknown.</p><p>But something like this, it just re-traumatizes the population. It re- ignites that already deep seated anger toward the government and it feeds into these ongoing feelings, as I was saying, of despair.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I think you paint the picture there incredibly well, Arwa. Just traumatic things to see, and on top of a terrible period that they've already faced over the last few weeks, not to mention the broader challenges going on.</p><p>[09:15:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you for that, Arwa. Arwa Damon there.</p><p>All right, new fires burning in California, Wednesday, as the West Coast battles unforgiving wildfires that have left at least seven people dead. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling nearly 30 fires in California. Wildfires are also devastating Oregon and Washington State, too.</p><p>The E.U. warning Britain not to alter its Brexit Withdrawal Deal. Proposed new legislation facing the British Parliament would allow the U.K. to change parts of the agreement signed by London and Brussels late last year.</p><p>U.K. Ministers admit that would be a breach of international law, but argue the change is only a minor clarification. The Irish Prime Minister told CNN this is no time to play games over Brexit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEAL MARTIN, IRISH TAOISEACH: This moving away from the norms of diplomacy and conduct between nations and between countries, and it's serious from that perspective, and I was very, very taken back by it.</p><p>And also annoyed and angry at the fact that there was no heads up. That was not the normal engagement that one would expect from countries involved in a negotiation process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, office managing platform Slack looks set to be a work from home winner, but the results on the lockdown quarter tell a bit of a different story. We'll get the scoop from the CEO.</p><p>And paying off, the CEO who took a salary cut for his staff finds them willing to return the favor. Gravity Payment, CEO joins FIRST MOVE later on in the show.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Workplace messaging app Slack closed down some 14 percent, Wednesday. Second quarter results suggested its struggled to capture the COVID-19 boost experienced by other work from home stocks.</p><p>Billing growth slowed even as the number of paying customers using the messaging platform rose. Here to explain, Stewart Butterfield, the CEO of Slack. Stewart, always great to have you on the show.</p><p>You know, I have to feel some sympathy when you see annualized levels of revenue growth in a quarter of 50 percent and people are complaining that you didn't do so well, but I guess the obvious comparison is the whopping growth of Zoom. Talk us through what happened.</p><p>[09:20:26]</p><p>STEWART BUTTERFIELD, CEO, SLACK: Sure. Zoom is obviously a tough one for anyone to compare to. But I think what you see is a demonstration of the size of the market and obviously that's good for us in the long run.</p><p>I think you're right, there's expectations that may be unrealistically related to that, but I think there's another thing going on here.</p><p>We talk about our wins in the enterprise and this quarter, it was a focus on financial services, companies like HSBC and LPL, Northwestern Mutual. Last quarter, it was Amazon and Verizon. We had record growth in the number of million dollar plus customers, but we had 8,000 net new paid customers this quarter. That's all kinds of businesses that are all over the world that brings the total to 130,000 businesses.</p><p>Obviously with that many, there's an enormous number of small and medium businesses and they're much less resilient in the face of this kind of economic condition. You see things like hiring freezes and layoffs.</p><p>We charge on a per seed basis, so that kind of -- the impact of that mutes what's going on underneath. The fundamental trends are phenomenal, that 60 percent increase in the rate of new customer acquisition is what drives billions in revenue growth in the future. So we're well set up, and I think it is a little bit hard for people to interpret that because they're not used to enterprise companies that have big success with the largest companies in the world, and also have an enormous pool of self-serve and small and medium businesses.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So are you saying you offered pricing concessions to some of those smaller and medium-size businesses simply because they were struggling because of the environment? Because even with that -- go on.</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: Well, yes, we did do some of that. But I mean more -- there's a kind of predictable rate of expansion, and when people are hiring less, then they expand less. We charge on a per user basis, and same thing with contraction.</p><p>When someone lays off 30 percent of their staff, it means, we get 30 percent less revenue from that customer. The impact of that, or the worst of that certainly happened in this quarter.</p><p>Expansion may be somewhat muted, but I think you'll start to see the net number reflect the positive contributions as opposed to like netting out to a more muted response because of the contraction.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, there will be people listening to this going, hang on a second. In a work from home shift in the COVID environment that we've been through, if Slack can't monopolize on that now in some dramatic way as a replacement for e-mail and in some way to make people's lives easier, then they never will. What is your response to that?</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: I think that we have. I mean, I can't remember the number off the top of my head, but something like 70 percent growth in the number of million dollar customers, enormous growth at the high end of the market and huge success, four out of six largest telecommunication providers in North America now use Slack, and I just mentioned all the financial services.</p><p>But the market leader in more or less every single category, whether that's travel, badly affected; media, positively affected; retail, hardware, technology, they all use Slack.</p><p>And that growth for us is accelerating. There is going to be an environment where there's 30 percent annualized GDP decline in a single quarter and record unemployment numbers, and that will also be reflected in our numbers because we serve such a broad range of businesses.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. The other thing obviously, the big decision that you've made and you and I have talked about the impact of Microsoft Teams as a competitor in the past, is that you've filed a competition complaint, you say simply the fact that it's a part of Microsoft Office, it's embedded, you never really get a look in at Slack because they've already got that option.</p><p>What difference would that make to your business? What have you lost, do you think, in terms of scale as a result of that?</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: Yes, I think there's no question that it has some impact or produces some friction. Despite that, we've been competing with Microsoft for 14 straight quarters and have continued to demonstrate real success there in the Enterprise, where of course most of our customers are, Office 365 users.</p><p>And the complaint that we filed, you know, that's not a strategy for the company. That's a tactic. And I think it would have been irresponsible for me not to pursue that when we genuinely believe that there is illegal anti- competitive behavior going on and we're pretty sure that the Commission will find the same and choose to pursue an investigation.</p><p>I don't put a lot of time and energy into that, but it's not just for us. That's on behalf of the whole ecosystem and competition more broadly, which ultimately benefits consumers. And this is just something that businesses do.</p><p>I mean, this is no different than AWS disputing the award of the JEDI contract with Azure a little while ago. It is no different than Spotify, the leader in subscription services filing a complaint against Apple.</p><p>Whatever perpetually goes on between Apple and Qualcomm, Salesforce complaining to the same Commission about Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn. It's just something that goes on in businesses.</p><p>So that's years in the making and I wouldn't read anything into that related on what's going on today.</p><p>[09:25:20]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So it's not a distraction or a distraction technique?</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: Not for me. For the lawyers and regulators.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. What is the message to investors, Stewart, at this moment? Because I think the message from the markets here and what we've seen this week is, there's a real concern. You're explaining it and you're saying look, good things are happening and we're talking to the right people and the people that are investing are making a shift.</p><p>What is your message to investors about what the future of Slack is and how you lift that growth going forward?</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: That's a wonderful question to get to answer, and the message is look at the growth in net paid customers. So a lot of these investors we have known for many years and they've made big bets on the company and we appreciate them as shareholders and kind of partners in this.</p><p>They have heard me say over and over again that the highest priority for the company is accelerating the rate of net new customer acquisition because that is the fundamental driver of the entire business.</p><p>So that's great, you know, 60 percent increase year-on-year, but what's even more encouraging for me is the reason why it is happening, and some of that is due to the increased importance and relevancy in the category in this environment where there's work from home, and all of that disruption, but a lot of it is due to just real momentum with product changes we're making that's improving the user experience for teams that are just signing up for Slack for the first time.</p><p>And more than anything else, it is Slack Connect, which is a new system that allows two Slack using organizations to communicate across organizational boundaries. That's been a real driver of the business.</p><p>Growth there is accelerating. You look back to Q4, it was 140 percent annualized growth, Q1 of this year, it rose to 160 percent and the most recent quarter over 200 percent and that's a network effect that will continue to propel the business forward.</p><p>This quarter, of the 8,000 new paid customers, a thousand came from Slack Connect and that was in half the quarter. We expect that number to rise. More and more people are docked in Slack Connect, and the message to Enterprise customers there, I think is a huge win because it's not just an improvement to the way that you collaborate and you get all the benefits of Slack and channels and higher engagement and all of that, but you also get a massive step forward in security and compliance and that's incredibly compelling.</p><p>Because what it is replacing is messaging and communication that's largely out of band with respect to the company. It is things like text messages and WhatsApp where the company has no visibility and all of that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Stewart, come back and talk to us next quarter. We'll see how you're doing. Stewart Butterfield.</p><p>BUTTERFIELD: I would love to. Looking forward to it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The CEO of Slack there. Thank you.</p><p>All right, the market opens next.</p><p>[09:30:58]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: U.S. stock markets up and running this Thursday and a major banking announcement to bring to you. Citigroup is making history by naming Jane Fraser as its next CEO. She will become the first woman to lead a major U.S. bank. Congratulations to her.</p><p>Now, just in the last week, more than 850,000 Americans filing fresh claims for jobless benefits. The pain goes on. Economist, Megan Greene is Senior Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and also for Chatham House in London, too.</p><p>Megan, fantastic to have you on the show with us. I have to say it's the 29.5 million Americans claiming benefits of some form in the latest check that stands out to me every week. These are enormous numbers.</p><p>MEGAN GREENE, SENIOR FELLOW, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL: Yes, they are huge, and you have to consider that at the same time, the unemployment insurance enhancement that was offered, the $600.00 a week that was passed under a previous fiscal stimulus bill has now expired and it's been replaced by a federally-funded $300.00 a week that's only actually being disbursed in six states and is already almost out of money.</p><p>So, all of these people are claiming benefits and actually the benefits have decreased quite a lot, which means that consumption will inevitably suffer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it is interesting. You have used the best illustration, I think out there among the alphabet soup options of what the recovery looks like here. A cartoon character for where we've been and where we are now. Wyle E. Coyote. Just explain what you see here for the economic recovery.</p><p>GREENE: Well, I think like Wyle E. Coyote, the U.S. economy has run off a cash cliff and it's suspended in midair and it hasn't really realized its predicament or fallen down into the chiasm yet, but without a safety net, I think that's inevitable.</p><p>So, in addition to the unemployment insurance enhancement that I mentioned, the PPP loans, the Paycheck Protection Program, which allowed companies, small companies to get loans which turn into grants that they kept people employed, those have already expired as well.</p><p>And as a result, we're going to face a bunch of small business bankruptcies and that will result in more unemployment. And again, unemployment insurance isn't what it used to be, and so I think we're about to face this huge headwind to the recovery unless we get some kind of new fiscal bill, and that's looking, actually, less likely today than it did even yesterday.</p><p>There's a chance in September that Congress will pass something. But if they don't, I think the U.S. will go back into recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When does that gravity point for Wyle E. Coyote actually hit? Because we're always behind the curve when we're collecting the data and seeing what's happening, and if you look at auto sales, you look at home sales, you look at the unemployment reading, if you believe it, that we got last Friday, it looks like we're on pace for a better recovery.</p><p>We could even see a great positive number for Q3. It sort of masks the underlying damage that's going on and the weakening.</p><p>GREENE: That's right, so traditionally economic indicators are all coming out with such a lag that they don't really mean anything anymore. So retail sales, durable goods, they all look pretty good still.</p><p>If you look at some of the higher frequency alternative data though, things like restaurant bookings, T.S.A. travel data, it actually shows that we're still recovering very slowly. So the bottom hasn't dropped out yet. But like I said, that's inevitable unless we come up with more support for workers and for small businesses in particular.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Your argument, and we need to take more time to discuss this, we have to reset as we rebuild for the labor market and part of that involves the challenges of a greater concentration of industry, a weakening of power of workers.</p><p>How do you give workers power back to fight for higher wages?</p><p>GREENE: So one way is to encourage unionization or stop discouraging it, at the very least. Another way is to address misclassification of workers. Lots of workers are being classified as consultants, so they don't get any benefits and so that they are on short-term contracts, rather than making them full-time employees, which they're really doing the job as, just without any of the frills.</p><p>So that's something else you can do, and then you can also address this market concentration issue. It's driven primarily by a lack of competition, so campaign finance lobbying gets to that.</p><p>And so if you could limit campaign finance, limit some lobbying efforts that might help address market concentration and sort of antitrust efforts to prove competition. That could help increase worker power a little bit as well.</p><p>[09:35:40]</p><p>GREENE: I mean, I think if you're looking for a really quick fix to this, though, it would be figuring out how to create good jobs, high wage, high hour jobs for lots of Americans. And there's a real opportunity in infrastructure spending, and particularly infrastructure spending to retool the economy for sustainability and climate change.</p><p>So that should be coming down the line. That was an absolute no-brainer before this crisis even happened, given how low borrowing costs already were. Now, they're even lower, so I think there's no excuse for not doing that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We need you advising the next administration, whichever one they are. Megan, we will continue this conversation. Thank you. Megan Greene, Senior Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. Thank you for that.</p><p>Now exactly on this point, leading by example, the CEO -- this CEO made waves when he offered all his employees a minimum wage of $70,000.00 and cut his own pay to fund it. We'll see how his business is doing and how his workers are doing, too, next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Meet the $70K CEO. In 2015, Dan Price was a millionaire running his own company, Gravity Payments, which is an interesting story in itself. But that was when he made a decision that's being studied and discussed to this day.</p><p>Price gave all of his 120 employees a big raise. Everyone would earn at least $70,000.00 a year. To fund it, he realized a different kind of gravity would have to apply to his own salary. He cut it from around a million to $70,000.00 as well.</p><p>[09:40:21]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Dan Price, the founder and CEO of Gravity Payments, joins us now. Dan, it's a huge pleasure to have you on the show. Where do we start? Let's talk about the day you woke up and were like, you know what, I know what I am going to do. I'm going to pay all my workers a living wage and I'm going to take a whopping pay cut myself. Talk me through that.</p><p>DAN PRICE, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRAVITY PAYMENTS: Well, Julia, you know, I've been studying business pretty much my whole life because I started my company when I was 17 and I had heard all of these things about measuring costs, but, you know, and kind of treating employees like cost centers. But I started to realize maybe that wasn't true and there was a little bit of propaganda being applied to what I was being taught every day.</p><p>And since 2011, we had been working on increasing wages for our bottom employees little by little. And it was going well, we were seeing a lot of success. But one of my friends who didn't work at Gravity, she was explaining to me how a $200.00 rent increase was throwing her life into chaos, and here, there are 120 employees of Gravity Payments that are doing all the actual work to build all the value from this company. I'm getting way too much from it. I'm getting way too much credit.</p><p>And it just hits me that I'm not okay with that anymore. And so, I was on a hike with my friend, Valerie and I decided that I was going to implement the $70,000.00 minimum wage, but was difficult and I decided I needed to just go for it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You basically realized that $200.00 could make all the difference to somebody and have little impact, actually, if somebody else loses it.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, and it's different because we are taught so strongly to look at employees as cost centers. We're taught to basically do everything we can to put our balance sheet first, and for all the companies out there that publicly say they put their employees first, we've seen in this crisis that they just quickly lay off their employees when things get tough and they kind of are babies at the top, to be honest.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You were laughed at. You were called a socialist. You were told that the business would fail, that this would be a study at Harvard Business School in how not to operate a business, and actually now, you're being studied as an example of something that worked for you and clearly worked for these workers.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, I mean, it is tough running a business. But it's not so tough, you know what I mean? And like the really hard work that people do -- I mean, I get way too much credit in this.</p><p>The fact that people are still talking about this five and a half years later, I think it says more negative about the system than anything positive about me. Because the reality is, we know that the people actually working at these companies, the people that work at Gravity Payments and all the small businesses that we're helping to reopen and support and make sure to keep safe during COVID-19, those are the ones that create the value.</p><p>I just manage it and kind of orchestrate it all, why should I be getting all the credit and all the money from that when the workers get left behind?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: COVID is an interesting one because your revenues dropped I believe 50 percent overnight and you looked at it and said we're just not sustainable like this. We're going to have to cut 10 percent of the workforce, and you told your employees and they made an interesting choice. Talk us through that.</p><p>PRICE: Yes, so I have a lot of great mentors in my industry that are more on the traditional business side and they share their views with me and I like to listen to everybody, regardless what their views are. And people basically told me two things. Number one, there's companies in our industry that are implementing $100.00 per month extra charges to small businesses. If you do that, you'll solve your fiscal deficit.</p><p>We were losing $1.5 million a month and we had three months before we were going to go out of business. Alternatively, the other option is you could lay off up to 30 percent of your staff and that would also solve it.</p><p>And I just was honest with my team about how I didn't know how we were going to get through this. And those doubters that you brought up, the people that said I was going to fail, you know, I honestly had to look at it and say maybe they're right, because I don't know how we're going to get through this.</p><p>But this is the magic of this type of business model and how I think most business people in the United States and around the world get it wrong right now, which is our employees came together. They formed kind of like a reverse union to rally around the company, and they volunteered on an individual anonymous basis to give pay cuts.</p><p>They wanted it to be anonymous because they didn't want anybody to feel pressure and they didn't want somebody who maybe just had a partner lose their job or a spouse lose their job to feel pressured to contribute.</p><p>So that team orientation, you're not going to get that in the traditional company that is slashing and burning and laying off people right now or a bigger company like Amazon that maybe, yes, is growing and hiring, but they're paying slave labor wages while the CEO makes many times over what all of the warehouse workers combined are making.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you prevented a Hunger Games scenario where people have to fight for themselves because they were on the bread line and fighting for survival, too.</p><p>Okay, because this is how you caught my notice. You don't hold back when you're criticizing bigger companies. You're pretty punchy about Amazon. You're pretty punchy about the scale and growth of CEO pay relative to individual workers.</p><p>There will be people watching this going, this may have worked for your business. One, are you profitable and is this really scalable as a business model for bigger companies to be able to stay in business, but also pay their workers more. Your response?</p><p>PRICE: My response is quit being such a big baby. I mean, people in the business were better getting all of that money, that are getting all of that success. Whenever the going gets tough, they sell out their workers. They sell out their customers and they get extra big bonuses.</p><p>You see that, you know, with AT&amp;T, the former CEO, leaves after getting $30 million working there and gets $60 million. You see it with Hertz. You see it with so many of these big companies. And we were taught that capitalism and running a business is about taking risks.</p><p>So actually take a risk for something that's good and stick up for your workers, and actually in the end, if you do that, it will pay off. But you have to be willing to not, you know, kind of coddle your CEO, coddle your shareholders. Take them through and actually give them a chance to help.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I was going to say that, because there's other stakeholders here and there's also customers. There is also investors. Do we not also, as customers, have to choose businesses that are fairer to their workers and as investors accept that better businesses pay their workers more?</p><p>PRICE: Well, there's a huge desire out there to do that. I mean, I get literally thousands of people reaching out to me every week saying I want to support businesses like yours.</p><p>But the big companies know that, and so they create monopoly power. They smoke out competition. They buy out competition. I mean, I myself, through the pandemic it's been stressful. You know, I've had days, weeks where I've been working 16 to 18 hours a day, triaging all these different emergencies that are happening, and at the same time I'm getting e-mails, hey, Dan, walk away and we'll give you more money than you could ever imagine that you could spend the rest of your life.</p><p>And so we're setting up this system where the people on top get such big rewards that they just walk away and then it preserves that monopoly power. The upshot on that on all of us is that when monopolies rule, the services that we receive are worse and so we get nickeled and dimed. We get all of these unfair processes and procedures, and that further incentivizes companies to lay off employees.</p><p>Because if the customer can't hold the company accountable, even for good service, let alone good behavior, then the company is going to act with impunity, and we're seeing that all over the economy, not just today, but really for the last 40 years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I agree with you. Dan, very quickly, just to answer the point you said about getting better offers and significantly better offers, any chance you would leave Gravity?</p><p>PRICE: I've been doing this since I was 17 years old and I've never been happier than I am right now, because our team knows we can make a bigger difference saving small businesses during the pandemic, giving them all the apps they need for social distancing and payments, than we have for the last 16 to 17 years combined.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I have a very soft spot for payments and I have strong beliefs about this. So, come back in a few weeks, please, and talk to me about your business specifically. We've talked about very important social issues, but I want to hear about the business, too. Dan, a pleasure.</p><p>Dan Price, CEO of Gravity Payments. Thank you.</p><p>PRICE: Always a pleasure, Julia. Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right, coming up, how plummeting oil prices are driving hundreds of companies out of business in the U.S. shale industry. A spot check. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:51:25]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: BP investing $1.1 billion in U.S. offshore wind power, a sign on the pressure on bigger oil to find new sources of income as crude demand and prices remain subdued. John Defterios looks at how the collapse of the U.S. shale industry is affecting lives in Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR (voice over): Midland, Texas, the beating heart of U.S. shale production. But this part of America, they know all too well what boom and bust feels like.</p><p>Oil service company, CEO, Bobby Bounds was all smiles during the boom. He and a dozen employees did industrial painting on storage tanks, pipes, valves, anything related to oil and gas in the giant Permian Basin.</p><p>Then COVID-19 hit, striking first on Wall Street and in no time, Main Street Midland felt the pain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOBBY BOUNDS, OWNER, HEAVY DUTY INDUSTRIAL: And so I woke up, I think it was on a Monday and the Dow Jones had dropped 2,300 or something and it wasn't 12-hours later I'm getting phone calls from my big customers telling me to stop all work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): An oil price war then broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia and prices went below zero for the first time in history, and so, too, did Bobby's business. All told, he lost a half million dollars of work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOUNDS: I'm the entrepreneur risk taker. I put resources at risk in hopes of a gain. And if I don't -- and if I get some gain, but then it goes bad, well, that's bad for me. But I see it's almost a gamble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: And in this high-stakes game of oil, he was forced to fold his hand, pack his bags for New Mexico, where he started a new business. The economic fate of the Permian is closely linked to what's called the active oil rig count.</p><p>Last autumn, when I was on the ground in Midland, it was listed on a sign downtown, 860 nationally, 414 locally. Today, as of early September, it's 256 nationwide and only 125 in the Permian.</p><p>Even the big boys feel the pain. As an independent player, Pioneer Natural Resources sits on the largest shale assets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICH DEALY, CFO, PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES: The world doesn't need a million barrels a day of growth coming from the U.S., we'll have to adjust our staffing levels down to -- right size it to our activity levels.</p><p>And so we are in the middle of that process right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): That's reflected in the local unemployment rate, rising nearing five-fold in a year, from just over two percent to 9.4 percent. Next door in Odessa, it's the highest in Texas.</p><p>Other oil producers and service companies did not survive, with three downturns in five years, 492 of them have gone bankrupt with a debt of nearly $300 billion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (on camera): How do you batten down the hatches? And for what length of time?</p><p>DEALY: It's really unknown at this point. It's really dependent on when we get a vaccine and see what happens to demand. So I would say, kind of the earliest is second half of '21, but it could roll into '22 or '23 time period, where we really see demand for oil get back over a hundred million barrels a day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): Meaning the shale shakeout for players big and small is far from over.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And John is with us. John, clearly devastating here. What has it meant for production and what hope for government support for these guys going forward?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: There are two key points here raised in there, Julia. This has been a perfect storm. Let's call it like it is, right?</p><p>We have this energy transition taking place. We talked about the BP investment. Money has been moving into wind and solar, battery storage already, so that's one trend.</p><p>The second trend is those investors who are staying in want higher dividends, so it's holding back production. And then you're clobbered by COVID-19. So we've lost from the peak in U.S. production in February, 13 million barrels a day, we lost three million barrels. It is like taking UAE out of the market because we are down in August at 10 million.</p><p>It started to stabilize, but that doesn't take into account the second wave. And originally, we heard Donald Trump wanting to bail out the shale producers, so proud of the 13 million barrels a day. I think they looked at the debt numbers, Julia, and said, wow, nearly $300 billion of debt accumulated over the last five years. We've had what -- nearly 500 companies go bankrupt over that period of time.</p><p>It would be good money chasing the bad money. So even if Donald Trump wants the votes in the shale basins, wants to support this group, they could not muster up a bailout and there's no talk about it right now.</p><p>It was a cleaning out, I think, Julia, that was overdue, and now just stabilizing after a nine-month washout. That's what it has been.</p><p>[09:55:58]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a struggle for the industry though, and lost jobs and potentially lost votes, too.</p><p>John, great analysis. Thank you so much as always.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Oh, big time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, that just about wraps it up for FIRST MOVE. Richard will be here with you tomorrow. I'll see you on Monday.</p><p>That's it for the show. Stay safe and have a good weekend.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020091001cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TF-M1Y1-DXH2-63MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DLP0</classCode><className>YUM CHINA HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS722513 LIMITED-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>YUMC(NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Labor and Employment, Food and Beverage, Hong Jong, Beirut, Fire, Slack, Litigation, Microsoft, Oil Industry, Bob Woodward, Donald Trump, Government, Politics, Health and Medicine, Coronavirus, Yum Brands, Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000982</classCode><className>JOBLESS CLAIMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RMA</classCode><className>RESTAURANT FOOD &amp;

According to a draft of the bill, companies would be required by law to provide an economic assessment every 90 days to each person that details data usage in a \u201cclear and conspicuous manner.\u201d</p><p>The legislation would apply to companies with more than 100 million monthly active users and force the companies to file annual reports on the total value of user data, along with a list of third-party contracts that benefit from the data that\u2019s collected. It would also give more power to the Securities and Exchange Commission by letting financial regulators develop ways of calculating the value of data in a way that\u2019s relevant to each company\u2019s platform and business model. (Some social media companies, including Facebook, already provide a total revenue-per-use estimate in their quarterly earnings, but it doesn\u2019t show how that number is calculated.)</p><p>In a statement, Sen. Mark Warner, D-V.A., who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Josh Hawley, R-M.O., said there\u2019s been an \u201coverall lack of transparency and disclosure\u201d when it comes to explaining to users how their data is collected and shared.</p><p>\u201cFor years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user,\u201d Warner said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true\u2014you are paying with your data instead of your wallet.\u201d</p><p>The Dashboard Act is the latest attempt by lawmakers to regulate the largest data-driven advertising companies\u2014including the likes of Twitter, Snapchat and Amazon\u2014which have come under increased scrutiny in the past year. Meanwhile, a number of legislative bodies at the state level around the U.S. have been working to pass their own versions of online privacy regulations.</p><p>Trade groups representing the nation\u2019s largest advertisers have said they would rather have national legislation passed than to deal with the issue state-by-state. This spring, the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A\u2019s), Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and others created a coalition called Privacy For America,\u00a0which pledged to work with Congress to address the issue.</p><p>Other trade groups are already preparing their members to deal with a tougher regulatory climate. For example, the Mobile Marketing Association and the Network Advertising Initiative have begun educating their members about how to comply with laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (which goes into effect in 2010) or the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect a little over a year ago.</p><p>The Dashboard Act is the second privacy-related bill that the pair of senators have co-sponsored this year. Last month, Hawley and Warner co-sponsored legislation along with fellow Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-C.A., that if passed would let users opt out of having their \u201cnon-essential data\u201d collected by enabling it at the device level.</p><p>In addition to giving more power to regulators, the Dashboard Act would also give more control to users by letting them delete all or some of the data that\u2019s collected about them by each company. However, there would be some exceptions. The drafted legislation includes provisions that would prevent companies from deleting data, such as any data related to ongoing legal claims or anything that might be needed for issues related to detecting security incidents or fraudulent activity.</p><p>In a statement, Hawley accused tech companies of hiding the value of consumer data and failing to explain how it\u2019s sold. He said the Dashboard Act will give users more control over their online experience.</p><p>\u201cWhen a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\u201d Hawley said in a statement about the Dashboard Act. \u201cThese \u2018free\u2019 products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1059502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDP-NRS1-DYRK-H25F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

There is, however, one exception: the new agreement says the U.S., Mexico and Canada can enact \"measures necessary to protect public morals\" and hold tech companies liable for content that facilitates sex trafficking, child trafficking and prostitution.</p><p>The agreement mimics Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which several libertarian experts have praised for protecting tech companies from liabilities and lawsuits related to the content curated on their sites. The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls the CDA's Section 230 the \"most important law protecting internet speech.\"</p><p>That protection ends when it comes to sex trafficking. The new USMCA specifically references the U.S.' amendment to the Communications Act of 1934, passed earlier this year, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (commonly referred to as FOSTA), which Silicon Valley lobbied against.</p><p>FOSTA was the result of an 18-month Senate investigation into Backpage.com, a website notorious for facilitating online sex trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. Thanks to FOSTA, tech companies can be held liable for knowingly running ads for sex trafficking and child sex.</p><p>Lisa Thompson, vice president of research and education at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said neglecting to hold tech companies liable for this in the new NAFTA agreement would encourage cross-border sex trafficking, which has increased rapidly over the past 10 years, especially at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>Simply copy-and-pasting Section 230 language into the new NAFTA agreement, she wrote in an op-ed for The Hill, would \"be nothing short of a sex-trafficking apocalypse.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley -- including many tech publications and libertarian voices -- decried FOSTA for restricting internet freedom, and Google lobbied earnestly against its passage. The tech industry also lobbied for the new NAFTA agreement to include Section 230 language without caveats. According to a Quartz report, internet and tech companies and associations spent $38 million on lobbying through August this year.</p><p>According to two lawyers in an analysis published by Bloomberg, \"The safe harbor [of Section 230] has always been a double-edged sword. For platforms, the task of monitoring user content and responding to demands to remove defamatory or otherwise unlawful third-party content could easily become so onerous as to be infeasible. On the other hand, for parties aggrieved by unlawful postings, it can be immensely difficult to cause an unresponsive platform to remove even obviously wrongful -- even demonstrably illegal -- content or speech.\"</p><p>In an August 2017 letter to congressional staffers, Google lobbyist Stewart Jeffries wrote that FOSTA \"has the potential to seriously jeopardize the internet ecosystem\" and \"undercut[s] one of the foundational statutes for the Internet: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\"</p><p>During Google's Q2 2018, Jeffries lobbied the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on behalf of Google on a number of issues related to the NAFTA (now USMCA) renegotiation, like \"freedom of expression and free flow of information,\" as well as lobbying Congress over \"anti-human trafficking\" and FOSTA.</p><p>Aware of the tech industry's push, rescued victims of sex trafficking sent a letter to Congress in September asking for the \"Section 230-like language\" in the new NAFTA agreement to be modified to hold internet and tech companies liable for \"knowingly facilitating\" sex trafficking.</p><p>Beyond Borders ECPAT Canada, a national advocacy organization seeking to end exploitation of children, said Canadian representatives in the NAFTA renegotiation responded to concerns \"that the agreement might include a blanket prohibition which would prevent Canada from imposing liability on internet providers for content. We are pleased to see that the agreement would allow Canada to hold internet providers liable for online sexual exploitation of children.\"</p><p>Beyond Borders ECPAT Canada also applauded FOSTA earlier this year.</p><p>While the USMCA is still a huge win for Silicon Valley, the tech industry's resistance to anti-sex trafficking efforts may only strengthen anti-Big Tech sentiments in Washington as scrutiny of some of the major players -- like Google, Facebook and Twitter -- intensifies.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Largely, it's the cost of buying and laying out fibre, together with the rental of another company's (Eir's) poles. Worse, it's fibre cable - which costs more to maintain and run in rural areas than cities because of the spread-out locations it's in.</p><p>So the network 'asset' that either reverts to the bidder or the State is now confirmed as being nothing like a (EURO)3bn prize. According to Communications Minister Richard Bruton, it will be more like (EURO)350m.</p><p>Even still, that's a hefty sum of money. How can the State justify leaving that in the hands of a private operator when it could construct the NBP contract in a way that sees the fibre cable reverting to its own control? Mr Bruton's main answer to this is that if the management company knows the cable will fall out of its ownership in a few years, it will be \"incentivised\" to let it run down in quality and service. By being allowed to keep it, it may be motivated in the opposite way: to invest more in it so that it remains a modern service in the long run.</p><p>But wouldn't it be possible to counteract this effect with a carefully-constructed publicprivate partnership contract outlining strict quality thresholds that needed to be maintained on pain of penalties? Maybe, Mr Bruton says. (For more on this, listen to The Big Tech Podcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.independent.ie\">www.independent.ie</url>/ podcasts.) There remains a lot to be desired about some details being withheld in this procurement process. It's understandable that a certain set of financial contractual details are considered commercially sensitive. This is mainly because if the bidder publishes its expected costs for each of the 1,000 or 2,000 things it has to procure itself, subcontractors and suppliers may simply jack the price up. That will cost us all, either through higher subsidies or worse service levels.</p><p>But other secrets are less easy to justify. For example, there is significant and legitimate public interest in the profit and return level which NBI is allowed to make before clawbacks start kicking in. The Government says that this is all commercially sensitive, but that it has set a level that reflects our best interests.</p><p>But we know the equivalent levels that other regulated telecoms entities are afforded.

It was the world we sought three decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nostalgia wells up as I remember the Berlin Wall being breached 30 years ago, a significant event in world history that changed the way I looked at the global order. I was awestruck and inspired by the emotion of a borderless world where restrictions would be lifted and inhibitions would be gone in a blaze of openness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was in my impressionable early teens back then as I watched the Wall crumble on national television on a show called The World This Week, produced by an Indian private channel, one of the few that existed in those days.</p><p>Cable television hadn't arrived in India (it took another three years for the country to throw open its socialist economy to Western influences). People switched channels on state-run Doordarshan television in search of liberation from the boredom that was peddled in the name of entertainment and news. They were left disappointed, yet never feared to dream.</p><p>I think of those days as being fenced-in as the government monopolised what people got to see on screen, what they ate, how much they ate (rations and subsidies were still the norm). It was an era of systemic regulation mania and bureaucratic incompetence known as Licence Raj that ruled all walks of life, where mediocrity was accepted and considered normal, even revered because one didn't have to try hard to climb the ladder. Red tape was rampant and India, a country with great potential that looked small in the comity of nations with governance coming to a standstill and corruption hugging the country and its economic potential in a deathly embrace.</p><p>The only time people let their hair down was when they indulged in some navel-gazing, watching song and dance clips from movies on Wednesdays and Fridays, in Hindi and in a regional language respectively.</p><p>Media, like I said before, was controlled in India, but the sight of people running into West Berlin from the East looked like the freedom run for all ages. The joyous expressions of those (now erstwhile) East Berliners were priceless. Some scaled the Wall; others were sitting astride it; they jumped and crossed the barricades in the chill of the night on a lap to victory. I still play it over and over in my mind.</p><p>Freedom looked hep and cool, without the communist ideology to constrict it; my limited, juvenile worldview opened to new influences and an attitude that wondered: if they can break through the Wall, so can we in India, a third world nation (now an unacceptable expression).</p><p>The World This Week brought it to our living rooms. It was the world we sought three decades ago. It is the world we still seek in an era of breaking news, social media, live television and reckless technological innovation that seems to put people and their aspirations last.</p><p>I believed the global citizen had arrived with that world-changing event in Berlin in 1989; people would finally rule over their leaders, they would travel freely and safely across borders and live without restrictions and inhibitions. Yes, the meek would inherit the earth. There would be acceptance, tolerance, and universal peace. The physical-psychological Cold War had ended and leaders would be in hot pursuit of the economic ideal of capitalism. They would find nirvana in international democracy and diplomacy that had been dreamed and drummed up by the West.</p><p>Three decades later that ideal lies shattered even as countries claim they are part of the global order. A borderless society that was envisaged then sans the physical boundaries has transformed into a thoughtless deformity as social media and Big Tech make us ride the monster of connectivity.</p><p>We have built more physical walls since the fall of the Berlin Wall. According to the UN Refugee Agency, at the end of World War II, there were only seven border walls or fences between countries. At the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall that number had gone up to 15. Now there are 77 such structures and fences. Fifty walls have come up since 2002. These include US President Donald Trump's grotesque concrete structure on the border with Mexico, the India-Bangladesh fence and the Israel-West Bank barrier.</p><p>They may be controversial but are deemed a necessity to keep 'unwanted people' and 'termites' out. This will ensure security, leaders tell us. That's because they have nothing else to do and want to be seen doing something.</p><p>Meanwhile modern tech tsars want us to stay in touch on a splintered Net. So we have Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter and others creating devices and parallel ecosystems that are nothing short of virtual fences to protect turf, clout, and profits. Countries like China and Russia have built great firewalls to keep Western online systems out.</p><p>I haven't been able to keep up with this frenetic wall-building in vast real and virtual estates, but I take solace from reading Robert Frost's Mending Wall to make sense of these developments. We keep the wall between us as we go. I hear the echo of 'good fences make good neighbours.' Perhaps it's the mischief of spring in me. Or is it a return to winter blunderland where status quo prevails?</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:-allan@khaleejtimes.com\">-allan@khaleejtimes.com</email></p><p><br/>Allan Jacob A news junkie with an abiding interest in foreign affairs.

We ruminate, we speculate, we sometimes even toast to what we hope - especially if you were an investor - will be a better year. Here, then, are my automotive predictions - like all such prognostications, they're just wild guesses - for the year ahead: Chevrolet's new mid-engine C8 Corvette will be available with one engine, and one engine only: Supercars, as enticing as they are, would normally not be the year's leading news event. But the new - finally! - mid-engine Corvette is dominating automotive headlines. When, where, and most importantly, how - as in fast - is all anyone around the office can talk about.</p><p>My issue is that the rumour mill seems convinced that the most eagerly awaited sports car in North American history will be powered by no fewer than three engines. Listen to Autoblog, GMauthority, Corvetteblogger and the like, and they all say that not only will there be a traditional 6.2-litre pushrod V8 powering base versions of the new Zora - named after Zora Arkus-Duntov, the Corvette's legendary chief engineer - as well as two versions of a new, double-overhead-cam, twinturbo V8.</p><p>I'm skeptical. First off, two completely different engine architectures - the DOHC 4.2-L and 5.5-L may share a common block, but the 6.2-L is a different animal altogether - make absolutely no sense in a limitedproduction supercar, especially one produced by bean-counting General Motors.</p><p>Second, Chevy's ubiquitous small-block engine has no place in a Eurocentric, mid-engine supercar. Its continued use has been a sop to Corvette traditionalists. Besides, the front-engine C7 will supposedly be sold alongside the C8 until at least 2021, by which time most of said traditionalists will have transitioned into their wheelchair years.</p><p>As for the two DOHC V8s, Cadillac's GF18 4.2-L is a shooin. Already developed for Caddy's soon-to-be-defunct CT6, it's also built in Bowling Green, so it's an absolute certainty for the C8.</p><p>As for the larger 5.5-L version still being rumoured, it's supposedly a bored and stroked version of the same 4.2-L, so those preferring this larger variant as a possibility need to ask themselves a question: Why would penny-pinching GM bother building a new engine - for a car, again, that will sell in minuscule numbers - when all they have to do is turn up the 4.2-L's boost? In current form, the 4.2 version pumps out an already impressive 550 horsepower. A little jazzing of the electronic waste gate, maybe even the addition of a little hybridization, and a 4.2-L C8 will be hunting down Ferrari 488s and Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1ns. MAGA! Of course, logical as that supposition may be, until we can get our hands on the C8, everything technical about the 'Vette is just a SWAG - that would be scientific wild-ass guess.</p><p>Something of which we're (sadly) surer, however, is that the new 'Vette won't be revealed at this year's Detroit auto show. That's because the North American International Auto Show is headed toward irrelevance: Oh, there may be an actual auto show in the coming years. But as an \"international\" automotive event, Detroit's days are over.</p><p>Once the centre of the automotive media universe and mustwatch TV for gearheads, Cobo Hall's stranglehold on the most important new model unveilings has been waning for some years now, losing ground to New York (more appealing to international scribes than Motown) and Los Angeles (because of the weather, natch). As a countermeasure, the show has been rescheduled from blustery January to sundrenched June.</p><p>Automakers are already making it clear they're not pleased. Typically, Detroit's new car showcases extend over an action-packed day-and-a-half scrum. This year, all the action is virtually over by noon on the first day. The automakers not displaying anything - Audi, BMW and more - are legion. I think I may be attending my last Detroit auto show.</p><p>The Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi alliance will break up in 2019: As Motor Mouth discussed last week, the man who engineered three disparate, mid-size players into the world's largest automaker is in a Japanese jail, his incarceration extended until well into 2019.</p><p>At least a few analysts think the timing suspicious - Carlos Ghosn was trying to deepen the corporate ties at a time when Nissan's board was seeking more independence - and this tempest-in-a-tax-avoidanceteapot is but a palace coup.</p><p>Those suspicions are made all the more real with the recent news that Nissan and Renault - which continues to support Ghosn as its leader - can't even agree to meet to discuss a road forward. This one's going to end in tears, folks, and like most divorces, there will be no winners. And finally, an automaker - I have no idea which one - will find itself on the wrong end of a wrongful-death civil suit: So far, we've let Silicon Valley off the hook with the deaths related to autonomous driving. Mainly, I suspect - and you should be reading this as an indictment of us all - because Joshua Brown (a corporate executive who bragged about Tesla's Auto pilot system) and Elaine Herzberg (a homeless and meth-abusing resident of Tempe, Arizona) were not sympathetic victims.</p><p>But what happens when a robot-driven automobile hits a pigtailed six-year-old running into the street after her favourite puppy? French prosecutors have already held mock trials on Big Auto gone awry.

And with the New Year come new rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the new year comes a whole host of new legislation, much of it introduced through 2017 but not due to go into effect until the beginning of this new year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China bans the ivory trade</p><p>China has long been one of the biggest markets for ivory, and a major contributor to the 30,000 African elephants that are killed each year to get their tusks. But that could be set to come to an end.</p><p>From the beginning of 2018, Chinese law bans all trade in both ivory and ivory products. Announced last year, the ban came into effect at the very end of 2017.</p><p>But it's already helping keep ivory out, even before it was passed. The price of ivory has plunged, falling 65 per cent, according to state media, and there has been a similarly drastic decline in the amount of ivory entering China. Many factories and shops dealing in Ivory have already shut down.</p><p>California legalises weed - and a whole lot else</p><p>A range of US states are set to get a whole host of new laws. But probably none of them will be quite as dramatic as California, which is being given a huge set of new legislation.</p><p>Read more</p><p>California marijuana laws explained</p><p>Most famous among those is legalised marijuana. A vote in November decided that it was no longer criminal to grow or sell the drug for consumption by Adults, and it became by far the biggest state to introduce the laws.</p><p>But in practice it's rather more complicated. Counties and cities will still get to decide how the law is enforced, and are allowed to decide which shops can open and when - that means that many shops still haven't cleared that hurdle, and there are only going to be about 20 such shops across the entire state as the new year begins.</p><p>You can read a full rundown of the details of the law here, from The Independent's Jeremy B White in San Francisco. But in short: now that the new year has begun it's now legalised, but that doesn't mean that it'll be any easier to actually buy it.</p><p>It's far from the only new legislation arriving in California with the New Year. There'll be new protections for undocumented immigrants, parents won't have to list their children's gender on their birth certificates, schools will have to give lunch to children who can't afford it and more.</p><p>Other states are getting new laws, too. In Illinois, for instance, dogs will now be treated more like children than property when people are getting divorced - meaning that they could be subject to split custody arrangements when people split up, for instance.</p><p>Germany rolls out new hate speech law</p><p>Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz: a big word for an important law. The legislation - which translates into Network Enforcement Act and is usually written NetzDG - came into force in early October but technology companies were given until the end of the year to actually start to comply with it.</p><p>Now any company that doesn't remove \"obviously illegal\" posts within a day could face huge fines of up to 50 million euros. All of the big tech companies, like Facebook, Twitter and Google, will be regulated by the law and be forced to remove anything as quickly as they can, once they're told about it.</p><p>It's not clear how extensive the removals will be, and therefore how much of a difference it will make to people outside of Germany. But whether or not NetzDG forces companies like Facebook and Twitter to act more quickly on problem content, they'll be pushed to do so elsewhere anyway - the European Union and many other individual governments are pursuing similar laws and regulations.</p><p>Banks hunting for illegal immigrants</p><p>From this month, banks will be forced to search through their customers and check on their accounts to see whether they are illegal immigrants. The rules - which have been criticised by both banks and supporters of migrants - are intended to help create a hostile environment for people moving illegally to the UK.</p><p>The new rules will go into effect in January, and apply to banks and building societies across the UK.</p><p>There's also a whole range of new laws set to go into effect through 2018 - covering everything from the gender pay gap to animal welfare, and much more. You can read a round-up of what's expected over the year from The Independent's Joe Watts, here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-39833377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R9M-N091-JCJY-G4HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>10:14 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 1, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The entire exercise is rife with failure and self-loathing, and you, dearest, have no need to make any. You are already reading the Guardian. You are perfect exactly the way you are.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Infinitely more fun than reflecting on one's own shortcomings is diagnosing the problems of other, richer, more powerful entities. It is in that spirit that we have created a list of New Year's resolutions for the tech industry. Our resolution will be to continue doing our best to hold them to account, which, like the most successful resolutions, is what we were already planning to do anyway.</p><p> Related:  How big tech finally awakened to the horror of its own inventions</p><p>                   Meet new people                   </p><p>Tech companies have been promising to improve their hiring of women and underrepresented minorities for nearly two decades. Hiring women, black people and Latinos is apparently so challenging for these companies that the vice-president of diversity and inclusion for Apple, Denise Young Smith, recently redefined diversity to include \"12 white, blue-eyed, blonde men in a room\" who have different \"life experience and life perspective\". (She subsequently apologized for lowering the bar so far that 12 white guys tripped over it.) </p><p>In this new year, we urge tech companies to try to get out there and make some new friends. Seriously. Lives depend on it.</p><p>                   Lose weight                   </p><p>Between SoulCycle, Soylent, and biohacking, Silicon Valley execs stay pretty fit. But some of the most powerful and valuable properties in tech - social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - are looking like they might have overindulged on some empty calories in their quest to consume our every thought, package it as content, and sell advertisements against it. Russian bots, white supremacists, and American presidents are all weighing down social media platforms. Time to go on a serious diet and shed this excess baggage. </p><p>                   Drink less                   </p><p>Venture capital has always been a respectable form of gambling for rich people, and 2017 has seen some terrible bets. From the $120m in VC funding raised by a $400 juicer that works about as well as two human hands to the $2.5m raised by a glorified vending machine with a culturally insensitive name and the $1.5m raised by \" startup dog prisons \", we have a very serious message to venture capitalists: go home, you're drunk. </p><p>Twitter is making us dumber and meaner. Let's just all get new hobbies and move on</p><p>                   Travel more                   </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg's 2017 resolution was to travel to all 50 US states. The resulting tour of dairy farms, black churches, and oil rigs helped the billionaire Facebook CEO learn about pressing issues for Americans, like how to drive a tractor and that the opioid crisis exists. \"I started this year as an engineer and now I'm wrapping it up thinking of myself as more of a community builder too,\" he said.</p><p>For 2018, we'd like to suggest that Zuck keep traveling, this time to foreign destinations where his social network is perhaps less of a community builder than it is a democracy destroying genocide enabler. He could start with Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Bolivia, Cambodia, Serbia and Slovakia - six countries where Facebook unilaterally imposed major change to the news feed that stifled the ability of independent news outlets to reach their audiences. He might then spend some time in countries where his own \" free basics \" program has reduced the internet to a walled garden of Facebook-approved content. </p><p>Finally, we'd advise him to travel to a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh where he can hear all about how Facebook has played a key role in amplifying anti-Muslim hate speech by the Burmese military and anti-Rohingya monks. </p><p>                   Spend time with friends and family                   </p><p>The tech industry got a head start on the post-Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment reckoning, but we have a feeling the house cleaning isn't over yet. </p><p>To any men who can't keep their hands to themselves in professional settings, we encourage any announcements about choosing to spend more time away from the office.</p><p>                   Spend less money                   </p><p>Since going public in March at a value of $28bn, the loss-making Snap Inc (the startup behind Snapchat) has continued to make losses. Big losses.</p><p>Among the company's most ridiculous decisions in 2017 was spending millions to manufacture hundreds of thousands of Spectacles - the company's \"hip\" new version of Google Glass - and then making it nearly impossible for anyone to buy them unless they lined up for hours or took a helicopter to a vending machine at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It all added up to a nearly $40m loss - a black eye not even the oversized Spectacles can cover up.</p><p> Related:  Facebook admits it poses mental health risk - but says using site more can help</p><p>                   Get organized                   </p><p>No, we don't need another productivity app. But the tech industry's various workforces, both white-collar and blue, should organize themselves.

Adamian, who is a cardiologist by training, was drawn to the opportunity to support fledgling entrepreneurs\u201dsome of whom were developing new drugs and devices that she knew doctors might embrace, if only the companies could get the funding they needed. \u0153Angel financing is a very different mentality because you look at early stage companies, Adamian says. \u0153The part thats the most fun is helping companies get off the ground.</p><p><br/><br/>So when Adamian transferred to her VC firms New York office in 2010, she started looking for life-science angel groups to join\u201dand found none. \u0153I didnt believe it, she says. \u0153I looked at it as an opportunity to build something in New York that didnt exist.<br/><br/>Hence, one womans love of angel investing led to the creation of New Yorks first angel group focusing entirely on biotech, health IT, and medical devices. The organization, called <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nyas.org/WhatWeDo/Innovation/lsanintro.aspx\">Life Sciences Angel Network</url> (LSAN), launched in October with 25 angels, a half-dozen or so sponsoring organizations, and an initial mandate to screen 50 business plans that streamed in from entrepreneurs who were eager to tap into the new funding source.<br/><br/>Adamians goal is to grow LSAN to include 100 angels. And she believes the city is ready to embrace the idea of investing in early-stage life sciences companies. \u0153In New York, the whole financing landscape has significantly evolved in the last three years. All of a sudden people are pursuing deals, she says.<br/><br/>Most of the seed money in New York is still being poured into tech startups\u201da problem thats more about impatience than lack of opportunity, Adamian observes. When she was starting up LSAN, Adamian visited a variety of angel groups, including the tech-focused New York Angels, and Golden Seeds, which invests in women-led companies in a variety of industries. Though some were dabbling in life sciences, none had truly focused on it, she says. Part of their reluctance, she believes, stems from the fact that the payoff can take longer to materialize in life sciences than it does in technology.<br/><br/>Adamian believes that patience will pay off for LSANs angels. As proof, she points to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2011/Q1-2011-Life-Sciences-MoneyTree.jhtml\">report</url> showing that in the first quarter of this year, New York was second only to San Francisco in venture capital funding for life sciences. Granted, it was a far second\u201dNew York companies raised $190 million, while San Francisco companies pulled in $381 million\u201dbut the Big Apple still beat San Diego, Boston, and Research Triangle in North Carolina. Its a sign, Adamian says, that New York is moving in the right direction. \u0153Life sciences is where technology was five years ago, she says. \u0153Theres still a lot to do, but the entrepreneurial spirit is here.<br/><br/>As LSAN was taking shape last summer, Adamian began looking for a home for the new group. A friend suggested she talk to the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nyas.org/default.aspx\">New York Academy of Sciences</url> (NYAS), a 200-year-old organization that promotes science education. Adamian balked at first\u201dNYAS isnt exactly a player in the business community\u201dbut she quickly realized that the organizations goals matched those of LSAN. \u0153They talk about promoting life sciences and healthcare, and figuring out why New York is lagging, she says. \u0153I had to give them a course in Angel Investing 101, Adamian jokes, \u0153and then we decided to get married.<br/><br/>LSAN is a multidisciplinary group of physicians, tech-transfer officers, intellectual property attorneys, and venture capitals. A selection committee meets every month to screen business plans and pick companies to come in and present their business plans to the larger group. The average investment, Adamian says, is between $600,000 and $1.5 million, though LSAN will assemble syndicates of investors for companies that need bigger financings.<br/><br/>Everything in Adamians career has led her to this point. Adamian was trained in clinical cardiology at the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (OOTC:MCLS) , and worked for many years in interventional cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The experience, she says, made her realize the value of healthcare innovation. \u0153As a physician, youre very happy to use a slightly better catheter, or a slightly smaller needle, she says. \u0153Small improvements make all the difference in healthcare.<br/><br/>Adamian transitioned into the business world by joining Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX)  as an associate medical director for the Taxus stent program in 2003, before joining Lehman Bros. as an analyst in 2005.<br/><br/>LSAN has evaluated five possible investments so far, all in the fields of medical devices and healthcare IT. The angels are in the process of closing investments with three of the companies. The group will fund biotech startups, Adamian says, but because thats riskier, its taking more time to find the right prospects. \u0153Its a very capital-intensive category, and 80 percent of the companies are failures, Adamian says. \u0153We have to pick carefully.<br/><br/>Part of LSANs mandate is to provide mentorship and support for entrepreneurs. Thats why Adamian selected sponsors for the group that could help young companies get off the ground. The sponsors include law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Meditech Strategic Consultants, and VC firm Ascent Biomedical Ventures. \u0153Entrepreneurs need help figuring out a clinical strategy, regulatory path, and so forth, Adamian says. \u0153One of the reasons we have sponsors is to provide that level of operational support to the companies that come to us.<br/><br/>Theres an educational mission, too. On June 1, for example, LSAN is teaming up with NYC Health Business Leaders to present a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2011/05/09/healthcare-start-ups-in-nyc-lessons-challenges-and-rewards/\">panel discussion</url> for entrepreneurs on how to navigate start-up challenges in the city.<br/><br/>With LSAN officially off the ground, Adamian is now turning her attention to recruiting the 75 additional angels she needs to give the group some heft. She invites potential members to the groups meetings, and meets personally with every prospective candidate.<br/><br/>To each prospect, she makes a convincing case that New York is the ideal home for life sciences angels. \u0153Most of the big pharma companies are here, she points out, as well as medical device makers such as Becton, Dickinson, which is now one of LSANs sponsors. \u0153If we go back to Silicon Valley in the 80s, all the big tech companies were there.
