State attorneys general are looking how these two companies capitalized on the popularity of their free services to dominate the lucrative online ad market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those probes supplement investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary Committee. The FTC has already completed two investigations on privacy, fining Facebook $5 billion and joining New York state in a $170 million settlement with Google's YouTube.</p><p>Though experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions.</p><p>Here's a look at how these companies dominate and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Critics believe a breakup - possibly by spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp - is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" to address harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, critics worry the company is able to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all. It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Android. But Google contends Android users like its products and want them on their phones.</p><p>The FTC's recently announced settlement with YouTube raises the prospects that the world's largest free video service might be a target for antitrust regulators, too, though viewers have an array of other options, if they are willing - or can afford - to pay for a subscription.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" NYU's Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is defending the 30% cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15% slice for renewals. The company says that covers costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps. The store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to force Apple to lower commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, spin off the app store entirely. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been exploring whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>Amazon insists it's far from dominant. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos called Amazon \"a small player in global retail.\" He notes that nearly 90% of retail is offline, in brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for nearly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 36.5% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson

State attorneys general are looking how these two companies capitalized on the popularity of their free services to dominate the lucrative online ad market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those probes supplement investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary Committee. The FTC has already completed two investigations on privacy, fining Facebook $5 billion and joining New York state in a $170 million settlement with Google's YouTube.</p><p>Though experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions.</p><p>Here's a look at how these companies dominate and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Critics believe a breakup - possibly by spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp - is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" to address harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, critics worry the company is able to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all. It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Android. But Google contends Android users like its products and want them on their phones.</p><p>The FTC's recently announced settlement with YouTube raises the prospects that the world's largest free video service might be a target for antitrust regulators, too, though viewers have an array of other options, if they are willing - or can afford - to pay for a subscription.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" NYU's Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is defending the 30% cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15% slice for renewals. The company says that covers costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps. The store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to force Apple to lower commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, spin off the app store entirely. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been exploring whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>Amazon insists it's far from dominant. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos called Amazon \"a small player in global retail.\" He notes that nearly 90% of retail is offline, in brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for nearly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 36.5% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson

State attorneys general are looking how these two companies capitalized on the popularity of their free services to dominate the lucrative online ad market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those probes supplement investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary Committee. The FTC has already completed two investigations on privacy, fining Facebook $5 billion and joining New York state in a $170 million settlement with Google's YouTube.</p><p>Though experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions.</p><p>Here's a look at how these companies dominate and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Critics believe a breakup - possibly by spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp - is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" to address harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, critics worry the company is able to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all. It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Android. But Google contends Android users like its products and want them on their phones.</p><p>The FTC's recently announced settlement with YouTube raises the prospects that the world's largest free video service might be a target for antitrust regulators, too, though viewers have an array of other options, if they are willing - or can afford - to pay for a subscription.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" NYU's Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is defending the 30% cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15% slice for renewals. The company says that covers costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps. The store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to force Apple to lower commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, spin off the app store entirely. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been exploring whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>Amazon insists it's far from dominant. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos called Amazon \"a small player in global retail.\" He notes that nearly 90% of retail is offline, in brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for nearly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 36.5% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson

State attorneys general are looking how these two companies capitalized on the popularity of their free services to dominate the lucrative online ad market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those probes supplement investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary Committee. The FTC has already completed two investigations on privacy, fining Facebook $5 billion and joining New York state in a $170 million settlement with Google's YouTube.</p><p>Though experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions.</p><p>Here's a look at how these companies dominate and what their defences could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Critics believe a breakup - possibly by spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp - is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" to address harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, critics worry the company is able to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all. It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Android. But Google contends Android users like its products and want them on their phones.</p><p>The FTC's recently announced settlement with YouTube raises the prospects that the world's largest free video service might be a target for antitrust regulators, too, though viewers have an array of other options, if they are willing - or can afford - to pay for a subscription.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" NYU's Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is defending the 30% cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15% slice for renewals. The company says that covers costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps. The store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to force Apple to lower commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, spin off the app store entirely. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been exploring whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>Amazon insists it's far from dominant. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos called Amazon \"a small player in global retail.\" He notes that nearly 90% of retail is offline, in brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for nearly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 36.5% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New York;

Tech giants Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are in the crosshairs of many investigations by federal regulators and several states' attorneys general.Manuel Balce Ceneta AP Noah Berger AP Marcio Jose Sanchez AP ALASTAIR PIKE AFP/Getty Images DENIS CHARLET AFP/Getty Images</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crackdown on Big Tech is intensifying as flanks of the government across the U.S. try to rein in the industry's immense power. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly every state - California and Alabama being the notable exceptions - joined in a bipartisan investigation of Google, just days after a smaller group announced a probe into Facebook. State attorneys general are looking how these two companies capitalized on the popularity of their free services to dominate the lucrative online ad market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those probes supplement investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary Committee. The FTC has already completed two investigations on privacy, fining Facebook $5 billion and joining New York state in a $170 million settlement with Google's YouTube. </p><p>Though experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions. </p><p>Here's a look at how these companies dominate and what their defenses could be: </p><p>Facebook</p><p>Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly? </p><p>Critics believe a breakup - possibly by spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp - is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example. </p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" to address harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. </p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google. </p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. </p><p>Google</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, critics worry the company is able to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently. </p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all. It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning. </p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Android. But Google contends Android users like its products and want them on their phones. </p><p>The FTC's recently announced settlement with YouTube raises the prospects that the world's largest free video service might be a target for antitrust regulators, too, though viewers have an array of other options, if they are willing - or can afford - to pay for a subscription. </p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" NYU's Fox said. </p><p>Apple</p><p>Apple's pioneering App Store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all of the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps. </p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. </p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is defending the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The company says that covers costs for running the App Store, including hiring people to review apps. The store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year. </p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to force Apple to lower commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, spin off the App Store entirely. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use. </p><p>Amazon</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries. </p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been exploring whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services. </p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals. </p><p>Amazon insists it's far from dominant. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos called Amazon \"a small player in global retail.\" He notes that nearly 90 percent of retail is offline, in brick-and-mortar stores. </p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for nearly 38 percent of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 36.5 percent last year. </p><p>Liedtke writes for </p><p>The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0101961349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-9RB1-DY37-F54H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

To begin to address the company's liberal bias, a shareholder resolution was filed to require the disclosure of the ideological perspectives of the company's board members. Although the resolution asked for comparatively little, it was still too much for Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The ideological diversity resolution was proposed by Justin Danhof, the director of the Free Enterprise Project. For those unfamiliar with it, the Free Enterprise Project is a part of the National Center for Public Policy Research, which is a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. founded in 1982.</p><p> In arguing for the resolution, Danhof wrote, \"True diversity comes from diversity of thought. There is ample evidence that the many companies operate in ideological hegemony that eschews conservative people, thoughts, and values.</p><p> This ideological echo chamber can result in groupthink that is the antithesis of diversity. This can be a major risk factor for shareholders.\"</p><p> In arguing against the resolution, Amazon wrote, \"Diversity is a cornerstone of our continued success, and we are proud of the diversity of experience and perspectives represented by our directors and our employees . Our Board composition reflects the robust nominating processes that we already have in place, which address much of what this proposal requests.\"</p><p> While Amazon might be proud of its diversity, the company's board is not very diverse in terms of race or age: the board is older and overwhelmingly white. The board appears to have five white men, three white women, one Black woman, and one Indian-American woman. The board ranges in age from 55 to 74, with only three members under the age of 60. In other words, there are no Generation Xers or Millennials on the board.</p><p>Amazon's board is not very diverse in terms of ideology either; its political spectrum seems to range from roughly the center to the left, with most on the left. According to campaign finance data from the National Institute on Money in Politics, it appears that the board has no conservatives, one nonpartisan, three moderates, and six Democrats, including two big Democrat donors. For example, board members Judith McGrath and Jamie Gorelick, who was a senior Justice Department official in the Clinton Administration, have both given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats; and board members Rosalind Brewer and Patricia Stonecipher, who worked in the Obama White House, have both given tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats. In contrast, there are no former senior Republican Administration officials on the board, nor are there any major Republican donors. If this is Jeff Bezos's idea of diversity, he needs to open a dictionary.</p><p> After the ideological diversity resolution was defeated, Danhof, its author, stated, \"Amazon claims to care about diversity and inclusion. [Amazon's shareholder] meeting put the truth to that lie. Amazon's board isn't interested in hearing conservative viewpoints. Furthermore, the company seems determined to keep funding anti-religious bigotry and partnering with groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center to demonize pro-family and Christian organizations.\"</p><p> Like other large technology companies, Amazon supports liberal causes, has stacked its board with liberals, and shows no interest in shifting course. While the government takes a look at Amazon from an antitrust perspective, before doing any further business with Amazon, conservatives should ask themselves if this is really the type of company that they wish to support. Perhaps, if Amazon's contempt for conservatives costs it enough business, it will rethink its liberal biases - or at least be more hesitant to publicly display its biases.</p><p> Richard McCarty is the Director of Research at Americans for Limited Government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-6f8c329116245a6fb0bfc06bba6c088d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B0A38BDF88A NWBKLA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8W-4641-DXVP-V0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Crowley Post-Signal, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It happened again in the late 1940s, when nuclear war seemed imminent. And it is happening now, as big technology companies work on artificial intelligence that threatens to create a world where human beings are eternal losers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''There's an old saying about how history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes, and we're definitely in a rhyming mode,'' said Edward T. O'Donnell, a historian at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. ''Our worries about our technological future are sending us back to solutions in our industrial past.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  For decades, antitrust regulation has been overwhelmingly focused on the welfare of the consumer. No cost to the consumer, no problem. That opened the door for Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon -- which offered digital services that were cheap or free -- to become immensely profitable and powerful.</p><p>  Now a backlash is mounting as renegade scholars  try to reverse years of established doctrine that they say does not appropriately take the clout of those companies into account. Economic absolutism is making way for other considerations as antitrust thinking goes back to its roots.</p><p>  ''People might enjoy using the tech platforms but they are also asking, What kind of society do we want?'' said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy. ''We're at one of those antitrust moments.''</p><p>  The change in antitrust thinking has recently gathered momentum. This month, American regulators indicated they were looking at Big Tech, inspiring a rush of ''about time'' remarks from politicians across the spectrum. Since then, President Trump, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler have all endorsed in their own ways a heightened scrutiny of the tech behemoths.</p><p>  Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, recently gave a speech in Israel  in which he upped the stakes by rejecting the consumer welfare standard as the sole determinant of harm. He went so far as to assert that ''diminished quality'' can harm competition, which could send regulators into some novel areas.</p><p>  Mr. Delrahim concluded by saying the antitrust division ''is working hard to stay true'' to the original vision of John Sherman, the Ohio senator whose name is on the 1890 antitrust act that was the first legislation against monopolies.</p><p>  The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in the Senate by a 51-to-1 vote, while the House endorsed it unanimously. It was two pages long, did not bother defining the word ''monopoly'' and was used in its first decade mostly to go after labor. Some historians think the conservative Congress that passed it was merely being cynical, offering a sop to reformers.</p><p>  The fear of the future, however, was real as the economy transformed itself. In 1890, the percentage of the population in agriculture was at 43 percent, down from 72 percent in 1820. The steel companies, meatpackers and railroads hired and then hired some more. The number of millionaires rose from a few hundred before the Civil War to about 4,000 in 1890, historians estimate. .</p><p>  ''The rising fear of the day was that honest, hardworking people are being screwed and the system is rigged,'' said Mr. O'Donnell, author of ''Henry George and the Crisis of Inequality: Progress and Poverty in the Gilded Age.'' People grew to depend on big companies like Standard Oil, just as their descendants today cannot sign off from Facebook and Google. But they did not necessarily like them.</p><p>  ''Nearly every household had a five-gallon red can of Standard Oil's kerosene,'' Mr. O'Donnell said. ''But the founder, John D. Rockefeller, was often seen as rapacious octopus.''</p><p>  In 1900, the Democratic Party platform included the belief that ''private monopolies are indefensible and intolerable,'' declaring: ''Unless their insatiate greed is checked, all wealth will be aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed.''</p><p>  Groundbreaking reforms followed, including the breakup of Standard Oil. In 1913, in a largely forgotten episode, National Cash Register Co. became the first tech company to be successfully prosecuted for violating the Sherman Act. Nearly 30 executives at the company, which controlled 95 percent of the cash register market, were convicted and sentenced to brief prison terms. While they appealed and never served a day, the company's power was broken.</p><p>  Antitrust moves ebbed and flowed through the 20th century. In the late 1940s, said Daniel Crane, an antitrust historian at the University of Michigan, ''there was quite a bit of alarm about the growing tide of industrial concentration following the war, and fear that undue levels of concentration could bring fascism or communism to power.''</p><p>  By the mid-1950s, Americans had reconciled themselves to working for large corporations but antitrust remained a potent force.</p><p>  ''Anybody who knows anything about the conduct of American business knows that the managers of the large corporations do their business with one eye constantly cast over their shoulders at the antitrust division,'' the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in 1964.</p><p>  One of the most controversial cases of that era is now enjoying a resurgence: Brown Shoe Co. Inc. v United States.</p><p>  The case began in 1956 when Brown Shoe, a manufacturer and retailer, merged with G.R. Kinney Co., which also made and sold shoes to customers. The government sued, saying the merger would increase concentration in the manufacturing and selling of shoes, eliminate a major competitor and deprive other shoe companies of a fair opportunity to compete. The government won the case in the district court and then, in 1962, at the Supreme Court.</p><p>  The case could give Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple nightmares. The reason: The way that regulators defined unhealthy concentration in a market. At the time, Brown Shoe and Kinney together owned only 7.2 percent of the country's retail shoe stores, and shoe stores were by no means the only place to buy shoes. The closest the merged company got to a monopoly was in six cities, where it sold over 40 percent of children's shoes.</p><p>Google, by contrast, has 92 percent of the worldwide search market today, while Facebook has 70 percent of the social media market and Amazon about 38 percent of the e-commerce market in the United States, according to research firms. (Antitrust arguments against Apple are less about market share and more about how it treats competitors in its App Store.)</p><p>Brown Shoe's argument that the shoe industry was ''dynamically competitive'' did not sway minds. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that ''the protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses'' was a priority, even if ''occasional higher costs and prices'' might be the result.</p><p>Brown Shoe is a ''foundational antitrust decision even though it embodies values that have fundamentally shifted,'' C. Paul Rogers III, a professor at SMU School of Law, wrote last year in the SMU Law Review.</p><p>  In an interview, he said, ''The court was very concerned about trends toward concentration and growth by acquisition. It ignored efficiency arguments, saying efficiency gains could actually be a negative because they can squeeze out the small guys.'' He added that he thought the case was wrongly decided on its facts, ''but if that populist approach comes back, it would be scary to these very efficient high-tech behemoths.''</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook declined to comment on Brown Shoe.</p><p>  If the populists gain more momentum, they have a ways to go to unseat the antitrust establishment, which still hews to the consumer welfare standard developed by Robert Bork, the influential legal scholar and judge, and scholars at the University of Chicago beginning in the 1970s.</p><p>  Some experts, like Mr. Singer of George Washington University, are waiting to see how sincere regulators are in their newfound zeal -- and where exactly they plan to go. Mr. Delrahim of the Justice Department mentioned in his speech some unusual applications of antitrust, including ''privacy protections'' and ''free speech on platforms.''</p><p>  Mr. Singer said that last was a nod to President Trump, who has said he and some of his supporters have been unfairly treated on social media. As for privacy, ''I am very skeptical that more competition is going to make the platforms less exploitative of user data,'' he said. ''Their whole reason for existing is to exploit user data.''</p><p>  At least for the moment, however, the reformers are ascendant and the economists defensive.</p><p>  ''The American people designed antimonopoly law so anyone can understand the rules,'' said Barry Lynn, the executive director of Open Markets, a Washington think-tank that has advocated antitrust reform. ''Enforcers followed guidelines that limited industrial firms to 25 percent of any market. To enforce the law, in other words, all you had to do was be able to count to four. We don't need economists to help us count to four.''</p><p>  Even if the reformers decisively win, the arguments will doubtless continue. The truest thing ever said about antitrust was by Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1990s.</p><p>  ''Merger enforcement in the United States,'' he said, ''has often been erratic and always controversial.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: John Sherman, an Ohio senator whose name is on the 1890 antitrust act against monopolies.

This hearing will focus on the company's recent proposal for a new digital currency called Libra, a plan that Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat and ranking member on the committee, said raises more \"anti-competitive concerns.\"</p><p>The dramatic day on Capitol Hill highlights the harsh spotlight politicians on both sides of the aisle now place on the country's largest tech companies. Once viewed in purely glowing terms as icons of American innovation, these businesses now face a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe from the House Judiciary Committee and two federal agencies paving the way for potential investigations into their market dominance. </p><p>And yet, the Libra hearing is also a reminder that these tech firms are continuing to invest aggressively to expand their businesses, despite mounting concerns that they are already too big and powerful.</p><p>In the weeks since news of the potential US antitrust probes first broke, Google announced a $2.6 billion acquisition to bolster its cloud computing division, Jeff Bezos teased plans for Amazon to spend billions to launch thousands of satellites that provide broadband internet, and Facebook unveiled Libra with the potential to change financial and payment systems around the world. </p><p>On the one hand, these continued investments are necessary to appease investors by showing new avenues for growth. But these announcements may only add to the sense that the giants of Silicon Valley are unconstrained and growing more powerful by the day.</p><p>\"The optics definitely aren't great, but I'm not sure they have much of a choice,\" said Bradley Tusk, a regulatory adviser who has worked with a number of tech companies, including Uber and Tesla. \"The markets demand that they keep advancing and, at their stage, only major new products or acquisitions can move the needle.\"</p><p>Tusk continued: \"It will give Congress even more ammunition to use in the hearings, so the pressure on the reps from each company to perform well is even higher.\"</p><p>Even before Congress launched its antitrust probe, there were growing calls to check the tech industry's power. In early May, Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes called for the company to be broken up. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren put out an aggressive plan in March to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon, leading other presidential hopefuls to echo concerns about these companies. </p><p>These calls followed a broader shift in sentiment about the tech industry. Since the 2016 election, internet giants like Facebook and Google have been embroiled in a series of PR crises over data privacy, the role their platforms played in election meddling, and the spread of misinformation, raising concerns about the full impact these powerful businesses are having on society. At the same time, these internet companies have increasingly expanded beyond their original markets into new categories, including healthcare, entertainment and transportation.</p><p>As more politicians in DC have begun to focus on Silicon Valley's concentration of power, the tech companies have trotted out multiple lines of defense in what could be a preview of the talking points at the upcoming hearing. Representatives for Facebook and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on this story. A Google spokesperson directed CNN Business to the company's previous remarks on antitrust concerns.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai told CNN Business last month that being bigger \"does offer many benefits,\" including the ability to invest in cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Similarly, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said being bigger makes it possible for the company to invest in preventing the spread of misinformation and election interference. Execs from both companies have also suggested that breaking up US tech companies could benefit businesses in other countries, namely China.</p><p>Another popular approach is for executives to define their relevant market as broadly as possible in order to make themselves seem smaller, a clear attempt to undercut the foundation of any antitrust argument. Amazon may be a dominant force in the US ecommerce market --- accounting for nearly 50% of it in 2018, by one estimate --- but the company has repeatedly stressed to the media that it represents less than 1% of the global retail market. Likewise, Facebook and Google may dominate US digital ad spending so much that they're often referred to as a \"duopoly,\" but Zuckerberg wants you to know that Facebook makes up less than 10% of the global online advertising market. </p><p>The tech companies could adopt a similar line of defense if questioned on their more recent investments. After Google agreed to acquire business intelligence platform Looker for $2.6 billion last month, the company's new cloud computing head told one publication the deal should not be an antitrust issue because a number of similar services remain on the market. Perhaps more to the point: while Google is the undisputed leader in search, it is behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud computing. </p><p>For now, slowing or stalling their big bets out of fear of pending regulation and looming antitrust probes --- and ceding ground to new and existing rivals in the process --- almost certainly poses a greater risk to the tech companies than any potential regulatory backlash to this continued investment. </p><p>Case in point: Bill Gates recently admitted that his biggest mistake running Microsoft was failing to build a mobile operating system to rival Apple's. If it had, Microsoft might have avoided its high-profile stumbles in the smartphone market. \"We were distracted during our antitrust trial,\" he said at an event last month. \"We didn't assign the best people to do the work.\" Other tech companies can't risk making that same mistake.</p><p>\"Critics don't like the big tech companies because of the size they have already obtained and the power they are perceived to have over speech, politics and privacy,\" said Doug Melamed, former acting assistant attorney general at the Justice Department in charge of the antitrust division. \"The companies pulling their punches now is not going to change that.\"</p><p>The tech companies, Melamed says, \"no doubt believe, correctly in my view, that there is no way the populists will get legislation this term to break up the companies or anything like that.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The audience showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what it is and what is not important when regulating these large companies. And it also showed a greater focus on the most important area of antitrust policy: mergers and acquisitions, and whether regulators have exercised sufficient surveillance.</p><p><br/>In recent years, large technology companies have become increasingly important to the U.S. economy and financial markets. The five largest technology companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now account for more than a fifth of the S&amp;P; 500's market capitalization. During the coronavirus pandemic, its value has only increased:<br/>When some companies become so large and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.<br/>A typical defense against such accusations is that technology companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined. For example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but it only accounts for about one-third of digital advertising revenue. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from other major technology companies.<br/>But focusing on whether or not a company is a monopoly doesn't make sense. Oligopolies, where some large companies dominate the market, also tend to exercise a degree of market power. In theory, they can allow powerful players to raise consumer prices, pay workers less, and pressure suppliers.<br/>For large tech companies, consumer prices are generally not the problem. The services provided to consumers by Google and Facebook tend to be free, while Apple's large margins are mainly due to the willingness of consumers to pay a lot for the brand value of an iPhone. Wages are a slightly higher concern. Large tech companies have already been caught and fined for agreeing to keep engineers' wages low, and much attention has been paid to the low wages and poor working conditions of Amazon's warehouses. But ultimately, large technology companies don't employ many people, and their proven anti-competitive activities have mainly involved high-paying workers. So while the wage suppression of big tech companies deserves close monitoring, it's probably not yet a major threat to U.S. labor markets.<br/>Greater concern concerns suppliers. Platform companies rely on a network of third-party companies: merchants selling on Amazon, websites that serve Google ads, app developers who sell on the Apple App Store, and so on. The size of the platforms potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a greater part of their revenue or even creating and then favoring competition from their own product.<br/>In the long run, as technology editor Tim O'Reilly has argued, large tech companies would likely be ossified and eventually lose by cannibalizing their own third-party ecosystems, but there is always a danger that short-term profitsare too tempting. It is therefore good that Congress has focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this problem will probably have to be solved with regulation, because the separation of platform companies will eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.<br/>Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital advertising spend now goes to Google or Facebook, and the fastest growing competitor is Amazon. Advertisers are the real customers who pay for free online services for consumers.<br/>This is one reason why legislators are concerned about platforms that buy from competition. Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted to the audience that he bought social media company Instagram in 2012 as a way to avoid a potential competitor. There have been accusations that the company tried or threatened to do the same with newer social networks, telling them that if they did not accept an offer, Facebook would launch a product that would compete with them and make them disappear.<br/>Ultimately, prices could increase for advertisers if Facebook properties are the only way they can reach social media users. Such purchases and purchasing threats could also have a negative effect on the formation of new businesses and economic dynamism, because only the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such purchases are illegal under current antitrust law.<br/>So, if there's a case for antitrust action against big tech companies right now, it's probably got into it with the acquisition of upstart competitors. Unlike most of the problems surrounding large tech companies, which are complicated and confusing because of the way the effects of the online network change the economy of scale, the concern for price-boosting anti-competitive mergers is very old and very common.<br/>In any case, it is a very good thing for Congress to start paying more attention to the problems of industrial and oligopoly concentration in the U.S. economy. Obviously, the case of large technology companies is the most well-known and popular, but with the increased concentration in most industries, it is to be expected that these audiences will be a starting point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and large dominant companies.<br/>Original Note:Big Tech Antitrust Scrutiny Should Be Just a Start: Noah Smith<br/>\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13581463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-BD51-DY1R-B0TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

New York: Columbia Global Reports. 2018. Pp. 14, 139. $14.99.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tim Wu (1) is the most important academic popularizer of law and technology debates (2) and is the intellectual leader of the neo-Brandeisian antitrust movement. He has brought antitrust from a technical subject of interest only to antitrust practitioners and academics to the forefront of policy discussions around the world. His ability to help shape policy is impressive. He is smart and a beautiful writer--an effective combination. Merely for making antitrust relevant to the general population, Wu deserves credit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wu's most recent book, The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the Gilded Age, is an attempt to reframe contemporary antitrust debates by returning antitrust to its more populist roots. Given the global implications of his ideas and policy proposals (including breakup of tech platforms) for many of the large corporations that he takes on, The Curse of Bigness offers profound insights for how society and business should be organized.</p><p>Antitrust and scrutiny of large tech platforms like Amazon and Facebook are hot issues in policy circles. For critics like Wu, the growing concentration of American power and the rise of tech platforms are nothing less than a threat to American democracy (pp. 16, 55). Wu sees the current growth of large tech companies as the result of a generation of antitrust legal misapplication and harks back to an earlier era of significant antitrust enforcement (pp. 17-21).</p><p>Wu's work is powerful and provocative. He makes several important points about how to think about the body of antitrust law. Wu would abandon the current legal framework of antitrust. However, although antitrust has made some tactical mistakes over forty years, the antitrust enterprise is not broken in need of total retrofit. Moreover, Wu's policy prescriptions are not sensitive to administrability concerns. Antitrust law is akin to common law. (3) Congress has purposely chosen not to make significant changes in antitrust's fundamental structure but has left it to the courts to fill in the gaps. Given this reality, more constructive criticisms would go to how to shift doctrine in ways that might promote some of the changes that Wu seeks. (4)</p><p>The first part of this Review summarizes Wu's major claims. It then highlights some of his critiques as to \"bigness,\" the multiple goals of antitrust, and the missed opportunities as to cases that should have been or need to be brought, such as against tech companies. Some of Wu's critiques are spot on in identifying missed opportunities, like a number of horizontal mergers that should have been challenged. Where Wu's book suffers is where he undervalues the institutional structure of antitrust law, underplays what antitrust does well as a substantive matter, and misanalyzes antitrust and tech platforms.</p><p>I. POLITICAL ANTITRUST?</p><p>The Curse of Bigness is a fundamental challenge to the \"Chicago School\" and its approach to the analysis of antitrust law that has dominated the United States since the 1970s. Robert Pitofsky wrote an important article in 1979 that guides Wu's analysis. Published in the famous symposium issue of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the article signaled the end not merely of populism but of the structure-conduct-performance paradigm. (5) Pitofsky chastised antitrust scholars for \"persuading the courts to adopt an exclusively economic approach to antitrust questions.\" (6) He argued that \"[i]t is bad history, bad policy, and bad law to exclude certain political values in interpreting the antitrust laws.\" (7) Pitofsky explained political values in a populist manner by noting,</p><p>if the free-market sector of the economy is allowed to develop under antitrust rules that are blind to all but economic concerns, the likely result will be an economy so dominated by a few corporate giants that it will be impossible for the state not to play a more intrusive role in economic affairs. (8)</p><p>Wu's book is part of this legacy. Wu is a powerful writer and explores similar themes with great passion and resolve. For example, he writes, \"[antitrust] does strike at the root cause of private political power--the economic concentration that facilitates political action\" (p. 23). Elsewhere, in describing the neo-Brandeisian agenda he explains, \"these suggestions would help us return to an economic vision that prizes dynamism and possibility, and ultimately attunes economic structure to a democratic society\" (p. 138).</p><p>Wu's major insight is to suggest that there needs to be a broader set of goals for antitrust beyond consumer welfare to address this populist impulse. (9) What this looks like in practice is not something that Wu spends much time developing.</p><p>Injecting political trade-offs into antitrust can have negative repercussions. In a world of multiple goals, government may pick winners and losers and may do so with something other than the public interest in mind. (10) Wu would replace antitrust as we know it with a regulatory system akin to what one finds in other administrative agencies (a public interest standard with some \"fairness\" element, industry comments on mergers, banning mergers of a certain size, among others features) (pp. 127-39). This solution is subject to the same capture concerns one finds in other agencies and would not adequately address Wu's concerns. Wu does not provide a mechanism to prevent special interests from lobbying to promote their interests over consumers' with a veneer of \"fairness.\" Indeed, Wu's previous writing in the telecom context suggests that capture is a significant risk. (11) The Robinson-Patman Act, discussed in Section V, illustrates the folly of a public interest-based antitrust.</p><p>Academics often change their approach following a stint in practice. Wu had short stints in government during the Obama Administration but not in a senior leadership role with managerial oversight in helping to run an agency. Such a position might have made Wu focus more on administrability concerns. When Pitofsky chaired the FTC in the 1990s, he did not adopt a populist agenda or embrace multiple goals as in his earlier writing. Rather, he continued with the economic framework that was established by prior Republican and Democratic administrations, and his tenure is seen as a \"golden age\" of antitrust. (12) Nor is Pitofsky alone in reworking his criticisms within an economics framework and abandoning a more populist approach to antitrust. Indeed, Wu's other antitrust works embrace economic analysis to guide antitrust and do not suggest the need for noneconomic values. (13) This suggests the difference between making academic pronouncements and having to create real change given institutional constraints when handed power.</p><p>Wu shows nuance with two sets of critiques. One is a populist critique that Wu calls \"neo-Brandeisian,\" which questions the singular efficiency-based goal expressed explicitly and repeatedly in the Supreme Court's antitrust jurisprudence and practiced by the two antitrust agencies (pp. 78-92). The second critique is within a law and economics tradition but suggests modifications to doctrine based on flaws in Chicago School assumptions (pp. 106-07).</p><p>Wu makes an important contribution, namely that some basic assumptions made by the Chicago School were crude or simply wrong and that improved economic analysis based on more precise models and more informed empirical work offers some alternative approaches for moving antitrust forward. He properly articulates that some Chicago assumptions, based on overly simplistic economics, may lead to bad results (pp. 102-09).</p><p>But Wu underestimates the current institutional setup of antitrust, in which a bad doctrine could be reshaped into something less harmful. As a result of the current institutional setup, antitrust addresses pure antitrust issues relatively well but other issues like privacy (14) or traditional regulation (15) less well. After suggesting that antitrust should be about such trade-offs, Wu does not offer insights into how to address the trade-off of efficiency and fairness inherent in a public interest standard. (16) What would an administrable set of cases to guide future business behavior look like? What would the workable legal rule be? What would be the burdens of proofs and the presumptions? On these issues, Wu does not offer detailed insights. But if the claim is that antitrust must change because of new realities in concentration and tech, it is incumbent on those proposing changes to offer a workable system. The strength of the current approach is how it marries economic analysis with legal administrability. (17)</p><p>Wu's conception of competition would be a broader \"protection of competition\" approach that focuses on the competitive process and looks beyond price effects (p. 136). But a broader competitive process has a populist element to it because it supports inefficient competitors, (18) and populism does not work within antitrust's institutional structure. Understanding economic analysis and antitrust's institutional structure of judge-made law explains why antitrust has evolved and why a populist embrace, short of new legislation, is unlikely to succeed. Antitrust is primarily federal law. But antitrust \"common law\" functions somewhat differently than other fields. Antitrust's enabling legislation allows for common law-like development. (19) In practice, statutes such as the Sherman Act enjoy a certain rank akin to constitutional common law. (20)</p><p>The Supreme Court offered an early articulation of this constitution-like principle to the Sherman Act in Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States. (21) There, the Court stated, \"As a charter of [economic] freedom, the [Sherman] Act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.\" (22) This framework changes how the Supreme Court views antitrust jurisprudence. Traditional stare decisis typically means that the Supreme Court is reluctant to overrule its precedent. (23) Antitrust works differently.</p><p>Unlike other areas of law, economic advances shape the rethinking of antitrust rules. Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has stepped in to revise antitrust law, narrowing or overruling precedents based on the current understanding of economics. (24) As such, stare decisis does not have the same meaning in antitrust as it does in other fields, as precedent matters less than changes in economic thinking.</p><p>The Supreme Court has explained that antitrust precedent is less important than precedent in other fields. For example, in State Oil Co. v. Khan, a case that removed the per se designation for maximum resale price maintenance, the Court explained:</p><p>[T]he general presumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less force with respect to the Sherman Act in light of the accepted view that Congress \"expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad mandate by drawing on common-law tradition.\" ... [The] Court ... reconsider[ s] its decisions construing the Sherman Act when the theoretical underpinnings of those decisions are called into serious question. (25)</p><p>This view of antitrust as a variation of common law has taken hold even in recent cases. As the Court stated in 2015 in Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, \"[w]e have therefore felt relatively free to revise our legal analysis as economic understanding evolves and ... to reverse antitrust precedents that misperceived a practice's competitive consequences.\" (26) This explicit incorporation of economic analysis--and the resulting limitation of traditional stare decisis in antitrust common law--makes antitrust unique among substantive areas of law. (27)</p><p>Since 1950, the basic statutory scheme of antitrust has remained constant, though it has been tweaked with the introduction of premerger notification (28) and increased penalties for antitrust violations. (29) To understand what antitrust can and cannot do, it is important to understand how the broader political economy of antitrust has shaped antitrust jurisprudence. Fundamentally, antitrust changes gradually rather than through seismic shifts. Thus, only by looking at the long term can one understand trends that shape cases that can be successfully brought in court. Even if Wu were correct that antitrust enforcement has not been aggressive enough, short of legislative change, antitrust is not capable of the type of enforcement profile that he ascribes to it. Antitrust's institutional attempt at a legislative solution to address \"fairness\" is the Robinson-Patman Act. (30) Its case law evolution shows that even a protectionist statute can be reinterpreted to have a goal based on economic effects, even when such a reformulation is in sharp contrast to the intent and actual language of the statute. (31)</p><p>II. MACROECONOMIC CHANGES TO THE U.S. ECONOMY HELP EXPLAIN ANTITRUST'S POLITICAL ECONOMY</p><p>Antitrust law and policy in part has responded to broader political economy concerns. These concerns support Wu's unease with the direction of the U.S. economy. (32) He notes the growing concentration in U.S. markets and suggests that concentration has led to a number of ills (p. 22). Wu's concerns about economic concentration should be taken very seriously as there have been growing disparities in wealth, health outcomes, and education, and a growing cultural divide. Changes in antitrust law and policy may have played some role in this. But neither Wu's work nor that of other neo-Brandeisians has clearly established antitrust as the cause of these broader policy shifts. (33) Wu's story should consider other factors--like employment and income--that implicate competition law and policy but have a benign or even positive impact on U.S. economic performance, innovation, and other measures of daily life for U.S. consumers. (34)</p><p>To provide a broader context of larger political economy shifts, this Review examines four instances of the vital intersections among macroeconomic factors, the industrial organization of the modern U.S. economy, and judicial and policy responses. There is a counterstory that antitrust populists ignore about U.S. growth--the effects of antitrust populism until the rise of Chicago School antitrust coincided with American economic decline. As antitrust rules changed to be more market oriented and where the outcome was improved economic efficiency, U.S. economic growth improved. Since the start of the Great Recession, however, a number of measures indicate that the U.S. economy is approaching the sickly economics of the stagnation period of the 1970s. (35) Now, the efficiency-based assumptions of modern antitrust are being questioned, and policy may respond as a result. But the circumstances between the 1970s and 2010s are distinct in terms of the shift within the Supreme Court and the antitrust agencies. Whereas the executive and legislative branches sat out of antitrust's shift to an efficiency-based goal for the most part (other than by appointing agency leadership that believed in economic effects), (36) change today focuses on these two branches in terms of possible legislative reform to antitrust law and candidates who would appoint antitrust leadership that would fundamentally transform antitrust.</p><p>We can divide shifts in antitrust based on four different time periods: Period 1: good times (1950-1972); Period 2: stagnation (1973-1982); Period 3: the modern era (1982-2006); and Period 4: the \"Great Recession\" and beyond (2007-2017). Table I summarizes these results.</p><p>Table I shows that the good times of Period 1 have not been replicated in any subsequent period and that the economic stagnation of Period 2 looks similar to Period 4 of the Great Recession and beyond. Real GDP averaged 4.20% in Period 1, 2.40% in Period 2, 3.46% in Period 3, and 1.52% in Period 4. U.S. nonfarm business productivity shows swings of 2.79% in Period 1, 1.14% in Period 2, 2.30% in Period 3, and 1.33% in Period 4. With the exception of Period 2 (average of 8.20% with a maximum of 13.30%), inflation has been relatively low in the other periods, with averages of 2.70%, 3.10% and 1.60% in Periods 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Unemployment averaged 4.80% in Period 1, 7.0% in Period 2, 5.90% in Period 3, and 6.80% in Period 4. Finally, median real family income (which tells us about total income growth and not distribution) averaged 3.28% in Period 1, -0.16% in Period 2, 0.92% in Period 3, and 0.62% in Period 4.</p><p>The overall trend is a function of many factors. Babies were not the only thing booming in Period 1. Rather, the entire economy boomed, and U.S. competitiveness did not really matter when the rest of the world was still in recovery mode post WWII. (43) This boom period weakened as a costly international war (Vietnam) and increased domestic spending (Great Society) meant that the economy struggled due to significant government spending and lower productivity. (44) In Period 2, academics, the antitrust agencies, and ultimately the Supreme Court questioned the basis for the existing multiple-goal antitrust regime (45) as U.S. competitiveness declined. Period 3 led to a loosening of antitrust rules and a larger liberalization of the economy. This led to more efficient business practices, such as improved vertical integration and economies of scale due to increased horizontal consolidation from mergers. (46) In Period 4, another set of international military commitments (Iraq and Afghanistan) and increased domestic spending with resulting economic hardship (Great Recession) (47) led people to question the antitrust regime. (48) If market competition no longer delivered in Period 4 in terms of macroeconomic gains, it is perhaps not surprising that we have witnessed the rise of antitrust populism to match the rise of overall populism.</p><p>From the antitrust perspective, these four periods identify several important procedural and substantive shifts. These political changes are linked to the types of cases that parties (government or private plaintiffs) were willing to bring before the courts. Ultimately it is the courts that shape antitrust policy, as business practices occur in the shadow of antitrust rulings. Understanding the larger political economy also explains why populism has reemerged--the current group of populists do not like the court outcomes on either substantive or procedural antitrust and believe that the current economic disruption will not be solved by the courts. (49) This meta-analysis also explains the impact of antitrust's institutional structure. Courts constrain agencies in the types of cases that can be brought and won.</p><p>Period 1 identifies a time in case law with rigid antitrust rules making much behavior was per se illegal or de facto per se illegal. This period included cases in which the Supreme Court pushed case law that restricted horizontal mergers, (50) vertical mergers, (51) and conglomerate mergers; (52) doubted efficiencies; (53) showed concern about dominant firms; (54) and especially restricted vertical restraints (55) and joint ventures. (56) On procedural issues, the Court provided a permissive view of government timing of enforcement. (57) This period, from an antitrust jurisprudential perspective, reflected concern regarding political and economic power. For example, in Alcoa, dicta included the assertion that \"great industrial consolidations are inherently undesirable, regardless of their economic results.\" (58) Similarly, in Procter &amp; Gamble, the Court identified that \"[p]ossible economies cannot be used as a defense to illegality. Congress was aware that some mergers which lessen competition may also result in economies but it struck the balance in favor of protecting competition.\" (59) To a certain extent, size and concentration were to be feared. For example, a combined grocery store market share of 7.5% in Von's Grocery resulted in the Supreme Court blocking the merger because the market was \"characterized by a long and continuous trend toward fewer and fewer owner-competitors which is exactly the sort of trend which Congress ... declared must be arrested.\" (60) Such jurisprudence was possible during a time when the macroeconomic factors were such that efficiency was less important because the economy was doing so well overall.</p><p>By the time we reach Period 2, the U.S. economy was in relative decline. (61) Antitrust jurisprudence began to shift during this period, in part because of new economic learning but in part because there was less slack in an economy in which the United States was less competitive globally. The loosening occurs in several areas: mergers, (62) vertical restraints, (63) standing, (64) specific-intent requirements in criminal antitrust cases, (65) and the abandonment of several cases where economic learning suggested that the cases were mistaken. (66)</p><p>Period 3 and a Reagan Administration-led \"Chicago\" revolution gave an intellectual basis for courts to loosen antitrust rules significantly. Instead, they promoted antitrust intellectual \"goals\" and ideological stability based on a consumer welfare standard resolved from the Bush I to Bush II period. (67) This period also included significant U.S. growth in productivity. (68) In terms of antitrust law developments, during this period, enforcement by courts and antitrust agencies increased the difficulty of finding concerted action, (69) heightened procedural hurdles, (70) focused horizontal mergers on finding anticompetitive effect, (71) and validated merger efficiencies. (72) This period also saw a shift to relaxed restrictions on dominant firm conduct. (73) Vertical restraints were also relaxed. (74) Finally, antitrust and IP were no longer at odds. (75)</p><p>In Period 4, the pendulum began to swing back in some areas, but the loosening of antitrust restrictions continued overall. Procedural shifts made it harder for plaintiffs to bring class actions. (76) In terms of substance, the burden shift became harder for plaintiffs in some rule of reason cases (77) and where the Court imposed new limits to state action. (78) But in other areas there was pushback against big tech companies, (79) more aggressiveness in terms of cases in reverse payments, (80) and a number of lower court wins to limit anticompetitive vertical restraints in the new economy (81) and in healthcare mergers. (82)</p><p>III. THE POPULIST ATTACK ON CONSUMER WELFARE IS MISGUIDED</p><p>Wu is hostile to the consumer welfare standard used in antitrust, concluding that the multiple-goals approach to \"antitrust law, which dared dictate what the economy should look like, needed to be put into hibernation--perhaps forever\" (p. 92). Yet, the consumer welfare standard that Wu attacks is not the actual consumer welfare standard articulated by Bork and the Chicago School. Bork's consumer welfare was actually total welfare; Bork cleverly called it consumer welfare likely in part because it was a better slogan. (83) The difference between the two, put simply, is that total welfare is the aggregate welfare of both producers and consumers, whereas consumer welfare focuses only on the welfare consequences of consumers. (84) Though at first the Supreme Court understood consumer welfare the way that Bork did, (85) today when the Court refers to consumer welfare it really means consumer welfare. (86) Most of the time, consumer welfare and total welfare yield the same result.</p><p>Consumer welfare does not really mean consumer welfare for Wu either. Wu's real concern is that antitrust has been guided by industrial organization economics and how economic evidence must match up with theories of harm. He would broaden antitrust to go beyond economic analysis and include a wider range of criteria that would be more democratic (p. 135). For example, Wu proposes public filing of industry comments on major mergers and of consent agreement remedies put up for public comment (p. 130). Wu claims that \"big mergers are political, and the idea that the public or its representatives be kept in the dark is hard to support\" (p. 130), thereby politicizing the merger review process. Such an approach is contrary to the Supreme Court's implicit warning in Trinko that antitrust courts are ill-suited \"to act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing.\" (87)</p><p>Such an outcome would be \"results\" oriented because broader concepts like \"fairness\" would by definition be fair in the eye of the beholder, and certain outcomes would be reverse engineered via case law because they were \"fair.\" It is for this reason that Phillip Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp are wary about the use of fairness in antitrust, noting that fairness is \"a vagrant claim applied to any value that one happens to favor.\" (88) Similarly, Donald Turner cautions that populism \"would broaden antitrust's proscriptions to cover business conduct that has no significant anticompetitive effects, would increase vagueness in the law, and would discourage conduct that promotes efficiencies not easily recognized or proved.\" (89)</p><p>The notion of what consumer welfare means has shifted as economic learning has shifted. These shifts become embraced in case law. An example in this shift involves healthcare mergers and market definition. After losing healthcare mergers, the FTC undertook a merger retrospective to understand hospital markets better. (90) Taking in more recent economic advances, (91) the FTC uncovered that the Elzinga-Hogarty market definition test (92) was flawed and overinclusive. (93) By using case law to rework theory, better empirical tools, and more data, the FTC won in Evanston to undo a consummated hospital merger. (94) Since that case, the FTC has had a much stronger track record of winning hospital merger cases because of the courts' embrace of more sophisticated economic models. (95)</p><p>Overall, economic analysis allows for a truly fair system--one that is decided by facts and real economic effects--not merely one side complaining more loudly than the other as to what is fair. (96) Professor Froeb and his coauthors summarize the shift and why technocracy is better as follows:</p><p>Forty years ago ... inference was primitive, drawn mainly from the Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm, and supported mainly by cross-industry regressions of price or profit on industry concentration. In antitrust trials, it was not uncommon for opposing experts to opine about the effects of a merger based on little in the way of economic theory or empirical evidence, and without offering any mapping from either to their opinions. Economic analysis now occupies a central role in antitrust enforcement and credible expert opinions are derived from theoretical and empirical models. (97)</p><p>This insight explains that it is consumer welfare that offers democratic legitimacy. Cases come down to facts--and analysis to explain these facts--rather than to a popularity contest. The transition to greater economic analysis in cases was a result of an organizational shift that gave equal weight to economists in U.S. antitrust agencies as to the lawyers. (98) When the economists have a say in working through cases, they can rethink economic models based on facts to better represent reality, whether using static or dynamic models. (99)</p><p>One reason for Wu's hostility to economic analysis is his concern that the consumer welfare standard fails to take non-price issues into consideration (p. 135). Yet consumer welfare can address non-price issues. In fact, it does so regularly. Wu cannot really believe that non-price antitrust analysis is a problem with antitrust. Many of the important conduct cases of the Chicago School era that Wu studies address non-price competition (p. 131).</p><p>Both at the Supreme Court level and at the lower court level, antitrust courts have dealt with non-price issues (often with price elements as well) on a regular basis. (100) Non-price factors are not new to antitrust. (101) Moreover, the Supreme Court expressly acknowledges that it can deal with dynamic issues in antitrust. (102) Indeed, history has shown that antitrust is focused not merely on short-term effects but also on long-run effects. For example, Learned Hand wrote in 1916, \"the consumer's interest in the long run is quite different from an immediate fall in prices.\" (103) Thus, economic learning helps shapes how agencies and courts view antitrust. (104)</p><p>Given the significant case law on non-price-related antitrust, Wu is unwilling to express what the attack on the consumer welfare standard is really about for him: the creation of an antitrust regulatory regime rather than an antitrust enforcement regime. That is, Wu implicitly wants to turn the antitrust agencies into a regulatory body with multiple goals and prospective oversight--akin to the FCC, an agency he has studied extensively. Yet, administrative agencies are rife with capture concerns. (105) Further, the FCC's record on mergers that Wu decries on the antitrust side is not strong. The FCC, using the public interest standard to review the same mergers as the antitrust agencies, also allowed for significant consolidation. (106) This is true for the FAA in airline industries, too. And various financial regulators (such as the OCC, Federal Reserve Board, and FDIC) that allowed financial services consolidation also have multiple goals. A public-interest-standard approach also assumes that government has the public interest in mind such that it responds to preferences by consumers and does not try to shape them. (107)</p><p>IV. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT PLATFORM TECH AND INNOVATION</p><p>Large tech companies should be feared, Wu suggests (pp. 21-22). Wu connects big tech's \"ubiquity\" to a nondescript \"sense of concern\" about their power, which he describes as a \"kingly prerogative\" (p. 21). Focusing on a handful of companies, Wu explains that \"[t]here stopped being a next new thing, or at least, a new thing that was a serious challenge to the old thing\" (p. 121). Broad-brushed critiques do not fully appreciate different business models and competition concerns that may arise with different types of technology platforms. For example, e-commerce platforms have a different model than cloud computing, social networks, fintech platforms, P2P platforms, and various types of search-related platforms, even though all compete on some level for advertising and users. Further, Wu ignores the rise of Chinese tech platforms as such Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, DiDi, Xiaomi, and Ctrip, which create global competition for Western firms both directly and in the market for vertical acquisitions. (108)</p><p>While such broad-brushed critiques may score political points with populists on both the left and the right, antitrust analysis requires an inquiry that marries economic theory to evidence. In practice, working through an analysis of tech platforms, which includes elements such as market definition and the substantive analysis of economic effects, is complex. (109)</p><p>Since Wu does not make a specific claim as to the evidence of the monopolization case that would require antitrust intervention and the extreme remedy of structural breakup, he focuses instead on the issue of nascent technology-related acquisitions by tech companies. Wu is concerned that acquisitions involving nascent technology and potential nascent competitors might have negative competitive effects if established tech platforms acquire smaller firms (p. 123).</p><p>Predicting future champions among tech companies is not easy. If it were, law and entrepreneurship would not be defined as a distinct field because of the inherent uncertainty of such investments. Entrepreneurship is complicated and exit strategies vary. (110) But a structural fix like Wu recommends would hurt innovation.</p><p>What makes entrepreneurship unique is that it involves high risk. (111) Venture capitalists (VCs) have a portfolio of investments to reduce risk because any one investment is not likely to yield big returns. (112) This is important given the limited time frame (typically ten years) in which the capital needs to be returned at the end of the fund. (113) As such, VCs do not make money on over half of their investments. (114) Corporate venture capital (CVC) invests in a portfolio of companies for similar reasons. (115) To protect themselves from entrepreneurial holdup, VCs create a series of legal mechanisms (negative covenants) to ensure some control even when they lack voting control. (116)</p><p>It would be a mistake to assume that antitrust enforcers could easily figure out which nascent firms might be competitors, let alone which firms might develop new markets. Wu understates how difficult it is to figure out the next sets of winners and losers. With significantly more information than an outsider (such as an antitrust agency reviewing a deal), even the best VCs and CVCs have trouble picking winners and losers. Just because a larger firm acquires a start-up does not mean that the best technologies, people, and ideas can be implemented to capture value from the acquisition. (117) Though it is possible that a particular transaction might create competition problems, the solution is to address specific deals with a sufficient factual record. To wholesale attack an entire business model that has been the primary form of exit for entrepreneurs not merely in platform-based tech but in biotech (118) would create economy-wide problems. When certain avenues for firm exit, such as vertical acquisition by larger firms, are closed off via limits to acquisition because of an overly stringent antitrust regime, it hurts the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Entrepreneurs would be chilled from creating start-ups if they could not easily create a liquidity event to extract financial rewards from their investment. (119)</p><p>V. ROBINSON-PATMAN ENFORCEMENT IS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF NEO-BRANDEISIAN ANTITRUST</p><p>There is a natural experiment that tests the Wu hypothesis of what antitrust would look like with a different set of goals, which until relatively recently diverged fundamentally from the Chicago School approach found in Sherman and Clayton Act jurisprudence--the Robinson-Patman Act. Robinson-Patman enforcement can teach us about what a more populist antitrust would entail.</p><p>If Wu wants a return to Brandeisian-style populism in antitrust, this requires a change in antitrust law given the current development of judge-made antitrust case law. But Wu's neo-Brandeisian critique and his push for new law should be informed by the negative experience of the interpretation and enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act. (120)</p><p>Unlike the other antitrust statutes, the Robinson-Patman Act was expressly protectionist in its drafting. (121) Further, its negative economic effect on efficiency is unambiguous. (122) A review of Robinson-Patman doctrinal shifts and scholarship suggests what Chicago did well in shifting an inefficient rule that hurt consumers, particularly poor ones. A review of Robinson-Patman and its decline also reflects the limitations of Chicago School economic analysis: what worked with regard to the analytical shift to Robinson-Patman was a function of economic consensus, as opposed to a number of areas of antitrust analysis where the economic literature suggests that Chicago-based antitrust analysis is coarse or potentially outdated. (123)</p><p>Academics have attacked the Robinson-Patman Act for decades because of the unambiguous harm to consumers that its enforcement has created. (124) Thus, on consumer welfare grounds the Act is an abomination. In this sense, both antitrust enforcers on the left and the right had a shared vision of the Act--the economics were disastrous. (125) Nevertheless, the Robinson-Patman Act has been shrouded in \"democratic\" values.</p><p>The origin of the Robinson-Patman Act (126) was based on protection of small retailers from larger, more efficient competitors (large buyers). (127) Originally titled the \"Wholesale Grocer's Protection Act,\" there were no multiple purposes to the Act akin to the Sherman Act, such that one could reasonably claim any sort of efficiency rationale for Robinson-Patman. (128) Rather, the Act was protectionism of a special interest under the guise of \"fairness.\" Thus, whereas the Supreme Court explained that \"[a]ntitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise,\" 129 the Robinson-Patman Act has been called the \"Magna Carta of Small Business.\" (130) The Supreme Court articulated how the Robinson-Patman Act embraces fairness over other goals:</p><p>The legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act makes it abundantly clear that Congress considered it to be an evil that a large buyer could secure a competitive advantage over a small buyer solely because of the large buyer's quantity purchasing ability. The Robinson-Patman Act was passed to deprive a large buyer of such advantages .... (131)</p><p>In fact, size (and potential scale-related efficiencies) is what drives down prices for consumers. Thus, to protect inefficient competitors, Robinson-Patman required a trade-off that hurt end consumers. (132) Because Robinson-Patman originally served to stymie the growth of the largest supermarket, the result is that the trade-off was regressive--those vulnerable consumers who needed lower prices were the ones most hurt by choosing a \"fair\" approach to antitrust to protect small stores.</p><p>This anti-bigness bias was pronounced in decades of Robinson-Patman jurisprudence in which large companies were punished merely for using buyer size to offer price reductions. (133) Thus, Robinson-Patman enforcement was a response to fears of size. (134) As Chief Judge Diane Wood recently noted, \"Its fit with antitrust policy is awkward, as it was principally designed to protect small businesses ....\" (135) For this reason, the Supreme Court explained that the Robinson-Patman Act \"was intended to justify a finding of 'injury to competition by a showing of injury to the competitor victimized by the discrimination.'\" (136)</p><p>Much of FTC enforcement in the 1950s and 1960s focused on Robinson-Patman violations. (137) Overall, because of a favorably worded statute that required no showing of market power, plaintiffs often won these cases. (138) But the Supreme Court slowly chipped away at the pro-plaintiff case law by requiring antitrust injury and a showing of consumer welfare loss even though nothing in the statute required either. (139) Change to Robinson-Patman happened gradually. It included a unilateral declaration by DOJ that it would not enforce the Robinson-Patman Act because the Act had a \"deleterious impact on competition.\" (140) Similarly, the FTC noted that the Act was protectionist. (141) In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC, the Supreme Court began to reign in Robinson-Patman enforcement so that it did not have \"open conflict with the purposes of other antitrust legislation.\" (142) Further, the Court applied the Sherman Act antitrust injury concept to the Act to limit the number of Robinson-Patman cases. (143) In Brooke Group, the Court made sure not to repeal the Act but read in a consumer welfare goal to Robinson-Patman where none existed. (144) Thus, the Court pushed the interpretation far, but not so far as to provoke a legislative response.</p><p>Robinson-Patman created some of the worst decisions in antitrust history in the sense that they hurt consumers. (145) Those consumers who benefit the most from low prices--the poor--bore the brunt of higher food prices. (146) To the extent that there was a trade-off that supported smaller and inefficient competitors, such competitors benefited over the most vulnerable members of society.</p><p>Utah Pie epitomized the failure of Robinson-Patman. In the case, national competitors entered the Salt Lake City market where Utah Pie had two-thirds market share. (147) As a result of competition, the price of pie decreased. (148) However, Utah Pie's market share decreased to just under 50 percent even while its sales and profits increased. (149) The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Utah Pie (protection of a competitor) and against competition. (150) Worse, during this period Robinson-Patman was enforced criminally. (151) Thus, a low-cost pie that benefited consumers could potentially land a baker in jail. Such is the perverse effect of \"political\" antitrust.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Antitrust works well because it is technocratic in that a singular (but flexible within its economics) goal is administrable institutionally. To introduce the world of political imperfections into a technical process that examines markets would create further distortions affecting consumers. (152) Antitrust does well dealing with antitrust problems. To the extent that there are other related problems, the right answer is not to create an antitrust that lacks democratic accountability (because antitrust becomes regulation via the backdoor) and exceeds its mandate of the past forty years. Rather, the better solution is to identify the underlying problem and solve it with more effective tools. If the problem is one of redistribution, tax is a better choice than antitrust. (153) If the problem is one of privacy, strengthen privacy laws. (154) If the problem is one of financial institutions or sector regulators not doing what they need to do, correct structural problems with sector regulators. Antitrust has increasingly moved out of sector regulation (155) and toward advocacy. (156) The advocacy budget of the antitrust agencies is tiny, and to the extent that the problem is the rules of the game for particular industry sectors, Wu falls short by not suggesting greater competition advocacy.</p><p>Wu's concern with big tech companies because they are big (p. 126) is as misplaced now as it was earlier in antitrust history. Antitrust has gone through various moments in which it had reevaluated whether it has the proper tools to combat anticompetitive behavior in technology-related markets. (157) It does have such tools and can bring important cases in these markets. (158) It was just a decade ago that we were told that Walmart was taking over shopping, that eBay was the largest online marketplace, or that Facebook was the primary way in which users shared information. Today, Uber competes with Lyft, Amazon has eclipsed eBay, Facebook is a legacy service, and younger people use any other set of applications to share information--such as Pinterest, Twitter, or Snapchat. In a world of continuous change, antitrust is what remains constant. It has the tools to police against unlawful exercise of monopoly power and adapts to changes in economic theory and empirics. To ask antitrust to go beyond its institutional capacity sets up antitrust to fail, because Wu's deeper concern is with how society is structured. That structure can be changed through elections to the presidency and Congress and through changes as to the makeup of the Supreme Court. Antitrust history shows that it is the Supreme Court that changes antitrust law and policy the most because of antitrust's common law-like nature.

That aberration is the continued reflexive embrace of antitrust regulation, an original sin of the administrative state with vast , potentially destructive societal costs.    With antitrust intervention, politicians and bureaucrats do not merely push companies around; they also directly or indirectly dictate business models and can even inappropriately influence the trajectory of entire economic sectors in non-market directions.          The big tech news this week is a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.    Called \" Online Platforms and Market Power : Examining the Dominance of Amazon  AMZN  , Apple  AAPL  , Facebook, and Google,  GOOGL  \" the hearing will feature the CEOs of each, appearing remotely: Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. This hearing is the committee\u2019s sixth in a series.    Its bad news when both parties favor economic regulatory intervention and that the state we\u2019re in now with antitrust. While international regulators and state attorneys general have their sights on these companies, all are targets of federal antitrust investigation by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission in the Trump administration. (Attorney General Bob Barr, separately testifying in Judiciary this week, is taking a lead role .)    In a joint statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said:    \u201cSince last June, the Subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement. Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. \"    The subcommittee will ultimately issue a report based on more than a year of information gathering, but will likely downplay letters for  the record and inconvenient testimony from antitrust skeptics. How do we know that? A headline on Drudge referred to an \u201cAPPLEFACEBOOKAMAZONGOOGLE Reckoning.\u201d Other articles refer to the CEOs facing a \"grilling .\"    The very notion of monopoly power in intangible code, in ones and zeros, seems perverse, though. And here we observe not one \u201cmonopoly\u201d but four companies (other giants could have also been invited to testify) vigorously competing against one another  in various ways . That would seem to exemplify competition rather than the stifling of it with which big tech stands accused.    The chief internal contradiction of antitrust is that it decries bigness and excess power but then urges that the biggest and most powerful entity of all \u2014 the government wielding the life or death power over all the CEOs\u2019 domains \u2014 impose a subjective remedy.    And government enjoys that power not just in the present case, but enjoyed it in all those that came before, and will in all those interventions to come after. That is a truly awesome power.    So we go through this theater with the dominant firms of the day every so often (AT&amp;T, IBMIBM  , Microsof  MSFT  t). Google is accused of favoring its own content in search results, Apple of downlisting rival apps, Facebook (and non-invitee Twitter, too) of suppressing conservative speech. Other gripes will be aired.    If the companies are so bad and the claimed consumer harm \u2014 the only condition that could justify intervention \u2014 is real, the more honest approach of the grandstanders would simply be to directly forbid consumers from using any of these companies\u2019 services. Consumers would surely thank Congress for its protection, right?    An antitrust subcommittee doing antitrust stuff is one thing; what\u2019s more striking is the degree to which Trump himself has energized and legitimized tech attacks, especially regarding issues like content moderation that will ride along at what is ostensibly an antitrust-centric hearing. (One GOP member wants the aforementioned Barr to investigate Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg for allegedly lying about to Congress about anti-conservative bias in prior hearings.)    On the one hand, and consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s well-known and broad deregulatory agenda to energize business, the administration took early steps to cut merger review times overall , and to speed up bank merger approvals via internal streamlining at the Federal Reserve and at the Comptroller of the Currency.    But often, President Trump has threatened antitrust action against tech and telecom firms, a stance conflicting with that deregulatory agenda and an especially dangerous tinkering with the marketplace and people\u2019s portfolios and 401(k)s in today\u2019s crisis-rocked world.    We could see it coming, though. As a candidate, Trump proclaimed , \u201cAT&amp;T  T  is buying Time Warner, a deal that we will not approve in my administration \u2026 because it is too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. \u2026 We will look at breaking that deal up and other deals like it.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s attempt to block the merger ultimately failed .     Similarly, Trump tweeted in 2018 that  Comcast CMCSA may be violating antitrust laws. However, after mulling it over (such delays of business transactions themselves impose heavy regulatory costs, something Trump recognized with respect to infrastructure approvals during his July 2020 White House South Lawn deregulation celebration ), the Justice Department ultimately did not investigate  the Comcast-NBCUniversal alliance.    With respect to the big tech players in the hotseat now, the president said in 2018 that Google, Facebook, and Amazon may be in a \u201c very antitrust situation ,\u201d and said he was \u201cin charge\u201d and \u201c looking at it .\u201d Even then, politicians and pundits across the political spectrum were calling for the breakup  of these companies. Forcible breakup calls for an even bigger entity to wield the axe, as noted; but one will not likely find that contradiction expressed in \u201cgrillings.\u201d    Some Republicans wanted Twitter at the Judiciary hearing also. Trump fought bitterly earlier this year with that company and has on numerous occasions threatened to regulate social media . In May, he followed though by issuing an executive order targeting their alleged \u201ccensorship .\u201d    The online speech debate and the antitrust debate are highly intertwined, and in addition to cutting big tech down to size, both the right and left want to change underlying rules that protect platforms from liability for user postings. This battle too will doubtlessly emerge at the hearing and continue thereafter.    While the Judiciary committee was conducting the months of investigations culminating in this week\u2019s \u201c Super Bowl\u201d hearing , the administration was doing similarly. Back in early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission announced a \u201ctechnology task force\u201d to assess tech sector antitrust violations and to go beyond current practice in scrutinizing transactions. In the wake of that, and in contrast to the administration\u2019s recognition of agency misuse of regulatory guidance documents elsewhere, the FTC is now in the process of drafting guidance on how the antitrust laws appl y to the technology sector and defending its own role in policing it.    In other antitrust developments, this year, the FTC requested data from top tech companies on their business acquisitions over the last 10 years. The commission is also pondering an injunction against Facebook\u2019s procedures for interoperability across platforms, and is in the early stages of investigating Amazon, having started interviews in 2019 with businesses that sell on the site.    Still other signals point to a potentially expanding Trump administration antitrust agenda by the Department of Justice and FTC beyond big Internet tech firms. The FTC, for example, has been challenging an aquisition transaction in DNA sequencing.    While the DoJ and FTC did issue a \u201cJoint Antitrust Statement \u201d with respect to collaborative activities among firms during the pandemic, expedited advisory opinions still constitute playing Mother-May-I.    America may have some real troubles right now, but so-called monopoly power among competing firms in media and online sales and services are not threats to the country calling for coercive intervention from this unfortunate alliance of Democrats and Republicans.    The reality is that the infrastructure needed in tomorrow\u2019s world of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence, and space travel and more will require firms of far larger scale than any that we today call big tech and fret over.    These giants of the future will likewise be competitive non-monopolies, unless government grants them monopoly power or license.    Having just celebrated years of regulatory cuts at the White House, now would be a good time for President Trump back off his counterproductive flirtations with one of the worst forms of economic intervention, antitrust regulation. Congress? That\u2019s not so simple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The District Court relied on the fact that Microsoft had not conceded that any of its business practices violated the Sherman Act, had continued to do business as it had in the past and had proved untrustworthy; and the government, acting in the public interest, had won the case and thus had some entitlement to a remedy of their choice.</p><p>115.

Posner, Antitrust Law 106 (2nd ed, 2001).

In conversations with some who support the restoration of the egalitarian goals framework, it appears that efforts to reset the goals of the antitrust system will require strong structural presumptions to be devised whose application to dominant firm conduct would facilitate attainment of the pluralistic goals agenda, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">see, e.g.,</emphasis> Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Bill, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">supra</emphasis> note 14. The goals would thus be achieved by applying the presumptions rather than making each goal a factor to be considered in a rule of reason inquiry.</p><p>149. These possibilities are examined in Kovacic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">supra</emphasis> note 102.</p><p>150.

Further that dysfunction in the U.S. antitrust institutions, and their failure to protect competition, has damaged the economy. This Article outlines the principal flaws that this commentary attributes to U.S. antitrust policy (the \u201ccrisis in antitrust\u201d), and some of the proposals offered to redirect it and restore it as a central tool of economic control. The paper\u2019s main purpose is not, however, to debate the condition of competition in the US economy or the merits of the measures proposed. Rather, its objective is to identify the magnitude of the implementation challenges that the proposals for a major expansion of the U.S. antitrust program create and the policy implementation challenges that stand between these soaring reform aspirations and their effective realisation in practice. The paper suggests that even though these \u201cimplementation\u201d issues are significant, they have been too quickly overlooked in the commentary. In our view the failure to focus on this important matter risks creating a chasm between elevated policy commitments and the capacity of responsible public to produce expected outcomes. The paper consequently acknowledges and addresses this implementation blindside. It analyses the important impediments that are likely, if not carefully addressed, to hamper delivery of the current proposals and proposes ways to overcome them.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><h>I. Introduction</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In June 2016, as the campaign for the U.S. presidency entered its final months, Senator Elizabeth Warren appeared at a conference convened by a Washington, DC, think tank and offered a grim report on the state of markets in the United States. \u201c[T]oday, in America,\u201d she observed, \u201ccompetition is dying. Consolidation and concentration are on the rise in sector after sector. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.\u201d 1 </p><p>Senator Warren was not the first to make this critique. 2  Yet, by giving it prominence, her June 2016 speech helped move competition policy into the mainstream of popular debate. 3  Today, her themes resonate in a large and expanding commentary that recounts a growing market power problem in the American economy (especially in its information technology [IT] sector) and dysfunction in its antitrust institutions. 4  By failing to protect competition, the federal antitrust enforcement agencies and the courts are said to have damaged the economy severely. Commentators give several reasons for the policy default: disregard of the egalitarian aims that motivated adoption of the U.S. antitrust laws in favor of an efficiency-based goals framework; 5  judicial fidelity to outdated views of industrial organization economics; 6  and enforcement timidity rooted in the capture by potential prosecutorial targets of the federal enforcement agencies, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 7 </p><p>The grievances sketched above have led to widespread debate and intensified demands for a redirection of antitrust policy and the application of other policy instruments to increase competition. High on the agenda is an extension of policy to provide greater control of the practices of leading technology companies (or Tech Giants) and dominant firms in other sectors such as agribusiness and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Although there are dramatically different views as to how exactly change should take place (see further Section II below), many proponents of change stress the urgent need for more vigorous and aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially by the federal agencies. For example, there are calls for the agencies to police future mergers more strictly, perhaps with bans or presumptions against certain mergers (including acquisitions by large incumbent enterprises of promising start-ups); to limit vertical integration; and to arrest exclusionary conduct by dominant companies.</p><p>Other suggested means of control include the creation of a new regulatory authority\u2014vested in the antitrust agencies or in a new government body\u2014with power to promulgate rules that would establish industry-wide codes of conduct, allow for the restructuring of dominant firms, and/or bar dominant firms from selling their own products on the platforms they own. 8 </p><p>Some demand a \u201croot-and-branch\u201d transformation of the antitrust system that would embrace objectives beyond enhancing the welfare of citizens as buyers of goods and services. 9  The expanded goals framework would seek to protect the interests of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), workers, and local communities, and, in doing so, to safeguard democracy itself. To this end, some suggest that the enforcement agencies should cease devoting resources to \u201ctrivial\u201d cases aimed at forestalling efforts by individual entrepreneurs and SMEs to earn suitable wages; 10  instead, agencies should focus single-mindedly on curbing monopoly by, for example, using structural remedies to unwind consummated anticompetitive mergers, to deconcentrate markets, and to prevent future antitrust violations. 11 </p><p>The debate has refocused the spotlight on basic issues about the aims of the U.S. antitrust system: what goal, or goals, should guide the interpretation and enforcement of the antitrust statutes; what are the advantages and disadvantages of adopting a \u201cpurist\u201d efficiency-orientation or a multi-faceted goals agenda, regime; and how a multiimensional set of objectives, anchored in cases such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States v Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa)</emphasis> 12  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown Shoe Co. v United States</emphasis> 13  (monopolization and merger decisions respectively), could be applied effectively by antitrust agencies in designing an enforcement program and by the courts in resolving individual cases.</p><p>The modern critique must be taken seriously. Three Senators that were seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination in the 2020 elections\u2014Senator Elizabeth Warren, 14  Senator Bernie Sanders, 15  and Senator Amy Klobuchar 16 \u2014have issued legislative proposals to carry out basic reforms of the U.S. antitrust system. The impulse for a redirection of antitrust policy is not merely partisan. President Donald Trump has voiced his support for closer antitrust scrutiny of leading firms, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (GAFA), 17  and Republican legislators such as Senator Josh Hawley have suggested a fundamental retooling of the federal enforcement mechanism. 18  The changing political mood appears to have spurred the public enforcement agencies to expand their programs, using existing policy tools, to address the accumulation and exercise of market power in the tech sector, 19  and the FTC has launched a study, using compulsory process, of acquisitions not subject to the government\u2019s premerger notification requirements that were undertaken by Amazon, Alphabet (including Google), Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2019. 20  Regardless of which candidate prevails in the November 2020 presidential election, the U.S. antitrust system seems poised for expansion.</p><p>In this article, we do not debate the condition of competition in the U.S. economy, nor do we assess the substantive merits of the respective measures proposed to correct the market and policy deficiencies identified. Instead, we focus on a less noticed issue\u2014the policy implementation challenges that stand between the soaring reform aspirations and their effective realization in practice. We thus take the reform recommendations\u2014presented in scholarly papers, blue-ribbon studies, and in popular essays\u2014at face value, and ask what legislators and policy makers must do to land them. For example, assuming that more aggressive antitrust enforcement is required, how can an effective program actually be delivered\u2014through winning antitrust cases and securing positive change\u2014and how can it be delivered well?</p><p>In our view, these \u201cimplementation\u201d issues have tended to be overlooked in the modern critique and to have been too quickly side-lined as technical details to be (easily) addressed once the high-level concepts of a bold antitrust program have been settled. 21  Implementation is not, however, a simple matter that will necessarily sort itself out once the intellectual architecture is in place. Rather, inattention to implementation challenges invites serious disappointment by creating a chasm between elevated policy commitments and the capacity of responsible public institutions (competition agencies, new regulators, and the courts) to produce expected outcomes. This is the implementation blindside. Unless the blindside is acknowledged and addressed, there is a significant risk that a major reform program will engage considerable resources, public and private, in initiatives that fall well short of their goals. Instead of restoring confidence in the ability of government agencies to enforce antitrust laws effectively, a failed effort might merely reinforce doubts, and cynicism, about the quality of public administration.</p><p>This article analyzes important impediments that are likely, if not carefully addressed, to hamper the delivery of the current proposals to expand competition policy significantly and propose ways to overcome them. It commences in Part II by introducing the principal flaws that modern commentary attributes to U.S. antitrust policy (the \u201ccrisis in antirust\u201d), before describing some of the proposals offered to bolster competition, strengthen antitrust policy, and restore its centrality as a tool of economic control. It also sketches how the federal and state agencies are responding to demands for more extensive intervention. As already explained, the purpose of this section is not to address the (respective) merits of these policy proposals but to identify the magnitude of the implementation challenges that the proposals for a major expansion of the U.S. antitrust program create.</p><p>Part III sets out the chief implementation obstacles that confront efforts to execute bolder antitrust programs, including tougher scrutiny of mergers and dominant firm conduct. We draw parallels between current debates and past ones, including those that influenced enhanced antitrust enforcement (especially by the FTC) in the 1960s and early 1970s and use historical examples to show what might happen if these hurdles are underestimated or ignored in the formulation of bold new initiatives.</p><p>Before concluding, Part IV of the article considers what it is likely to take to implement the proposals, and a program of expansion, successfully. It emphasizes measures to ensure that reform commitments properly account for the capacity of the public agencies to execute the commitments successfully. The discussion includes consideration of how antitrust agencies might undertake a more ambitious program with or without receiving new powers or resources from Congress.</p><h>II. The Modern Proposals for Change</h><h>A. The Crisis in Antitrust</h><p>At a high level, the modern critique of U.S. antitrust policy argues (with resemblances to criticism voiced in earlier eras 22 ) that antitrust shortcomings\u2014including lax federal enforcement and judicial acceptance of permissive antitrust doctrine since the mid-1970s\u2014have contributed significantly to large increases in concentration and the creation, and entrenchment, of market power in many sectors of the economy. 23  These developments are said to have raised prices for consumers, diminished innovation and new business development, and increased business margins and profits. 24  Some commentators and politicians go further and emphasize the adverse consequences of these changes on democracy 25  and income or economic inequality, 26  so laying at antitrust\u2019s feet \u201ca myriad of perceived socio-political problems.\u201d 27  In these critiques, weak antitrust enforcement is one key element of a larger failure of the government to promote competition to spur growth, to ensure that all citizens enjoy the fruits of prosperity, and to safeguard the sound functioning of the democratic process.</p><p>Modern critiques often compare the current antitrust system to enforcement policy between the late 1930s and the early 1970s. In this era, courts and enforcement agencies developed strict rules governing collusive agreements among competitors, vertical agreements between manufacturers and distributors, and dominant firm behavior. In addition, with the adoption of the Celler-Kefauver Act in 1950, 28  Congress bolstered the Clayton Act\u2019s merger control provision, 29  which the DOJ and the FTC applied aggressively to challenge business combinations. With encouragement from the Supreme Court, the agencies imposed tough restrictions on horizontal and nonhorizontal mergers. 30  Judicial decisions and enforcement policy embraced an egalitarian vision that emphasized the attainment of objectives (such as the preservation of SMEs and democracy) beyond the promotion of economic efficiency. 31  Public enforcement and jurisprudence formed what Jonathan Baker has called a political bargain that tolerated the development of large firms in return for the assurance, provided by robust antitrust policy, that such firms would not attain or abuse positions of dominance through improper exclusionary tactics, and that rivals would not use mergers or cartels to achieve and exploit market power. 32  Among other effects, the political bargain helped forestall the adoption of more intrusive forms of regulatory supervision, such as public utility control of pricing and entry. Largely unchallenged by significant foreign economic rivals, and perhaps facilitated by strong antitrust oversight, the U.S. economy enjoyed extraordinary growth from the end of World War II through the 1960s.</p><p>The rising concern articulated in the modern critique is that developments since the mid-1970s have depleted the force of antitrust law. As described below, commentators assign responsibility to various factors, including the Supreme Court\u2019s misguided acceptance of the notion that Congress intended the Sherman Act to be an efficiency-oriented \u201cconsumer welfare prescription\u201d; 33  judicial decisions that narrowed antitrust law\u2019s reach; and permissive antitrust enforcement.</p><h>1. Repudiation of the True Goals of the Antitrust Statutes</h><p>Although proponents for change have different perspectives (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">see infra</emphasis> II.B), some contend that the courts and enforcement agencies were wrong, from the mid-1970s to the present, to abandon the broad vision that Congress had embraced in enacting the Sherman Act in 1890, 34  the Clayton Act 35  and Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, 36  the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936, 37  and the Celler-Kefauver Act in 1950. 38  Courts and enforcement agencies have wrongly replaced the original legislative commitment to protect smaller firms from oppression and preserve a democratic political order with a single-minded focus on consumer welfare and efficiency. 39  Some argue that the abandonment of antitrust law\u2019s original concern about the full range of injuries that monopoly inflicts on citizens\u2014not simply as purchasers of goods and services but also as workers, entrepreneurs, shop owners in local communities, and participants in the democratic process\u2014is the chief cause of what has gone wrong with the U.S. antitrust system. 40 </p><h>2. Retrenchment in Antitrust Doctrine</h><p>It also has been argued that guided by a false conception of antitrust\u2019s goals, or how its goal (or goals) is to be achieved, the federal courts have raised procedural, evidential, and substantive bars to antitrust actions excessively and gone too far in loosening antitrust restrictions governing vertical agreements, dominant firm behavior, and mergers. 41  Reflecting a deep-seated concern about the hazards of overenforcement, confidence in the ability of markets to renew themselves, and wariness of the U.S. system of private rights of action, 42  the courts have systematically and incrementally diminished the likelihood that a plaintiff can prevail in antitrust litigation. Not only have these developments discouraged private litigation, but they have also made the federal agencies more risk-averse in deciding whether to challenge dominant enterprises 43  or attack mergers, except in cases of unusually high concentration.</p><h>3. Misguided and Timid Federal Enforcement</h><p>The modern critique also argues that U.S. enforcement policy has gone badly astray since the 1970s. For the most part, the DOJ and the FTC are said to have declined to challenge dominant firms and oligopolies; 44  overlooked the harmful effects of vertical integration; 45  and allowed mergers that increased concentration or allowed dominant incumbents to absorb smaller firms that may have emerged as major competitive forces. 46  At the same time, the federal agencies are said to have squandered precious resources on trivial matters (notably, the prosecution of horizontal restraints cases involving small, poorly paid service providers).</p><p>For a mixture of all or some of these reasons, an increasing number of advocates are becoming supporters of a more expanded competition policy.</p><h>B. The Proposed Cures</h><p>The critiques touched on in the section above are varied and result from different policy perspectives. Broadly, advocates for change can be group into three categories: (i) do substantially more with the existing antitrust system; (ii) do more with the existing system and enact additional regulatory mechanisms; and (iii) undertake a \u201croot-and-branch\u201d transformation of the U.S. competition policy system.</p><p>Although we survey the reform proposals from the broad perspective of each of these groups below, we recognize that this classification scheme is imperfect. For example, all three groups share some policy preferences\u2014such as increasing scrutiny of dominant firm conduct and stiffening merger control. Further, although differences across the groups are detectable with respect to goals, and views differ about whether the consumer welfare standard has betrayed the antitrust laws, the first two groups would continue to emphasize consumer interests in designing policy. In contrast, the \u201croot-and-branch\u201d group would adopt a broader conception of citizen welfare that accounts for the well-being of individuals not only as purchasers of goods and services but also as workers and owners of smaller businesses. Views about the severity of measures needed to correct existing market pathologies also vary across the groups.</p><h>1. Do Substantially More with the Existing System</h><p>One major group of reform advocates argues that the journey toward better policy does not require the adoption of new statutes, wholly new goals, or the creation of new regulatory institutions. This group would employ a concept of consumer welfare that encompasses effects on prices, quality, and innovation; it would not extend the range of goals to include effects on small businesses or the well-being of workers (except as injured by the exercise of monopsony power). 47  In their view, the existing framework presents untapped possibilities for a more activist program. The bases for needed improvements would be an evolution in, and the imaginative application of, existing doctrine 48  and, crucially, a recalibration of error cost analysis, 49  which today suggests that the hazards of intervening too much to correct certain phenomena (e.g., improper exclusion by dominant firms) exceed the costs of intervening too little. Federal enforcement agencies should be more proactive and change their appetite for risk by bringing more cases in the courts, even if they might fail. 50  They consequently place the burden on antitrust agencies to be mindful of the threat of underenforcement and to undertake a more ambitious agenda, extending far beyond its current focus, and scrutinizing a wide range of exclusionary or collusive behavior and mergers, including:</p><p>vertical restraints, such as platform MFNs;</p><p>practices of standard-setting organizations that allow owners of standard essential patents to exploit their market power;</p><p>conduct arising in regulated, or recently deregulated, markets;</p><p>refusals to deal, predatory pricing, and other newer forms of monopolization;</p><p>horizontal shareholdings in concentrated product markets; and</p><p>horizontal and vertical mergers, especially through the revival and strengthening of the structural presumption and vigorous scrutiny of acquisitions of start-ups.</p><h>2. Do Substantially More with the Existing System and Create a New Digital Regulator</h><p>The second group largely accepts the agenda described above and would make one notable addition: the creation of a new regulatory body to oversee digital technology giants. As proposed by the Stigler Center report on competition in digital markets, 51  the new regulator would have the power to set rules governing the conduct of leading digital platforms\u2014for example, by imposing nondiscrimination obligations on platforms and even to break them up. This proposal draws upon and extends recommendations made by a United Kingdom advisory panel to create a new \u201cdigital markets unit\u201d within the UK government. 52 </p><h>3. Root-and-Branch Transformation</h><p>The third collection of reform proponents is generally receptive to the proposals of the first two groups, but argues that these measures are seriously incomplete. Advocates of the root-and-branch approach (which include leading political figures such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) contend that more dramatic reform is required to deal with America\u2019s \u201cmarket power problem,\u201d as monopolies and oligopolies not only raise consumer costs, block entrepreneurship, stunt investment, and retard innovation but also \u201cdepress wages and salaries\u201d and \u201cconcentrate political power, which they use to win favorable policies and further entrench their dominance.\u201d 53  These advocates claim that as today\u2019s market problem resulted from abandonment of antitrust law\u2019s true aims, antitrust must return to its origins embedded in a broader citizen-welfare standard that addresses employment security, wage levels, economic freedom of consumers, the well-being of SMEs, the preservation of democracy, the diffusion of concentrated private and political power, and a wariness of monopoly power in all of its forms. 54 </p><p>The root-and-branch program would have two dimensions. The first would have the DOJ and the FTC use existing powers to reorient enforcement in a way that would resemble but expand the enforcement agenda we describe above for the do-more-with-what-exists groups. Secondly, however, because proponents of root-and-branch reform believe that expanded use of existing tools will not suffice to transform the U.S. regime, they contend that legislation is necessary to overcome permissive rules embedded in judicial doctrine and to supplement existing enforcement institutions. 55 </p><p>Reorientation of enforcement would require both a curtailment, repudiation, or revision of some existing programs (e.g., advocacy and law enforcement efforts that challenge occupational licensure restrictions or attack efforts by low-wage service providers to raise their fees 56 ) and expanding enforcement through:  challenging individual dominant firms and tight oligopolies, with routine recourse to structural remedies to deconcentrate affected sectors (including the prosecution of new antitrust cases to break up technology firms, including GAFA); 57 using expanded theories to challenge vertical integration by contract or ownership; 58 challenging price discrimination, through the restoration of Robinson-Patman Act enforcement as a core element of federal antitrust policy; 59 strictly oppose mergers whose concentrative effect exceeds levels set by the U.S. Department of Justice Merger Guidelines issued in 1968 60  and adhering to the policy aims set out in Supreme Court decisions such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brown Shoe v. United States</emphasis>; 61 using potential competition theories to bar leading firms from acquiring smaller, start-up enterprises that could otherwise emerge as strong challengers to incumbent giants and make a broad category of mergers between large firms presumptively unlawful; 62 closely scrutinizing completed mergers, and the conditions attached to them, including efforts to unravel mergers that the federal agencies improvidently cleared or approved subject to inadequate remedies; 63 routine FTC use of Section 5 of the FTC Act to overcome doctrinal limitations imposed by the existing Sherman Act and Clayton Act jurisprudence that embraces a consumer welfare standard and unduly confines the interpretation of these statutes; 64 promulgation by the FTC of trade regulation rules to establish codes of behavior applicable on an economy-wide basis. 65 </p><p>Such steps are to be facilitated, reinforced, and supplemented by suggested legislative steps, for example:  the creation of a new competition advocate to survey markets, receive complaints, and make public recommendations for investigations by the FTC and DOJ into possible market exploitation and anticompetitive behavior; 66 new legislation banning or limiting information services platforms, or other monopolists, from integrating vertically or selling products in competition with third parties who use their platforms; 67 making certain conduct presumptively abusive 68  and the introduction of fines for, and to deter, monopolization offenses; 69 new legislation to limit mergers that unfairly consolidate corporate power, in particular through the application of strong presumptions or bans against certain mergers (e.g., large or \u201cmegamergers\u201d 70 ) or through use of presumptions designed to prevent not only mergers that will increase prices, but those that will reduce wages, cut jobs, lower quality, limit access to services, stifle innovation, or hinder the ability of SMEs to compete. The purpose of the new legislation would be to facilitate successful challenges by agencies and to incentivize companies to be better corporate citizens.</p><h>C. Implementing a More Ambitious Enforcement Agenda: The Steps So Far</h><p>Demands for stronger competition programs are already inspiring adjustments at the DOJ and the FTC. Over the past two years, the FTC has conducted an extensive set of public hearings to consider how it can meet changes in, and the new demands of the economy. 71  In addition, it has established a Technology Enforcement Division in its Bureau of Competition to lead its enforcement efforts in the high-tech sector. 72  Both federal agencies have initiated investigations of the Tech Giants, the agencies are in the process of preparing vertical merger guidelines (for the first time since 1984) 73  and Digital Guidelines, and the DOJ is conducting a review of leading online platforms to identify practices that create or maintain structural impediments to greater competition. 74  All of these activities have accompanied the stated commitment of the federal agencies to apply more resources and scrutiny to dominant firms and to mergers involving the acquisition by major incumbents of nascent competitors. 75  The federal activity is taking place against the backdrop of visible, significant inquiries by state attorneys general, individually and collectively, into the conduct of digital platforms, including Google and other leading technology firms. It is easy to imagine that the collection of federal and state efforts will lead to the initiation of new cases in 2020. 76 </p><h>III. Obstacles to Effective Implementation</h><p>The proponents of change have set out a breathtaking agenda for reform. The various papers and reports are powerfully reasoned and argued but devote relatively little attention to the question of how their proposals can be achieved successfully. Rather many of them seem to be predicated on the assumption that any legislative changes required can be introduced rapidly and that the new, more aspiring, program can be driven home straightforwardly by agencies led by courageous leaders and supported by a larger staff that shares the vision for fundamental change.</p><p>The discussion below, and history, seems to indicate, however, that more courage and more people will not necessarily overcome the implementation obstacles that stand in the way of a program that requires the rapid prosecution of a large number of complex cases against well-resourced and powerful companies. Indeed, the criticisms levied at the current system, the proposals for more effective enforcement and reform, and the scale of the action being demanded bear some resemblance to those that led to a more re-invigorated and aggressive antitrust enforcement policy in the 1960s and early 1970s. For example, at that time complaints that the FTC was in decay, was obsessed with trivial cases and failing to address matters of economic importance, anticompetitive conduct, and rising concentration, 77  led the FTC to embark on a new, bold, and astoundingly broad enforcement program. 78  In an effort to meet criticisms of it as a shambolic and failing institution, the FTC sought to upgrade its processes for policy planning, made concerted efforts to improve its human capital in management and case handling, and sought to improve substantive processes and the quality of its competition and consumer protection analysis.</p><p>In the end, FTC\u2019s efforts to improve capability proved insufficient to support the expanded enforcement agenda, partly because the Commission failed to formulate an adequate plan to overcome the full range of implementation obstacles. The FTC seriously overreached because it did not grasp, or devise strategies to deal with, the scale and intricacies of its expanded program of cases and trade regulation rules, the ferocious opposition that big cases with huge remedial stakes would provoke from large defendants seeking to avoid divestitures, compulsory licensing, or other measures striking at the heart of their business, and the resources required to deliver good results. The Commission lacked the capacity to run novel shared monopoly cases that sought the break-up of the country\u2019s eight leading petroleum refiners and four leading breakfast cereal manufacturers 79  and simultaneously pursue an abundance of other high stake, difficult matters involving monopolization, distribution practices, and horizontal collaboration. The FTC also overlooked swelling political opposition, stoked by the vigorous lobbying of Congress, that its aggressive litigation program provoked. 80 </p><p>New legislation envisaged by reform advocates could ease the path for current government agencies seeking to reduce excessive levels of industrial concentration by arresting anticompetitive behavior of dominant enterprises (through interim and permanent relief) and by blocking mergers that pose incipient threats to competition. It seems clear, however, that such dramatic legislative proposals are likely to be fiercely contested through the legislative process and so will take time, and be difficult, to enact. Further, even if armed with a more powerful mandate, the DOJ and the FTC will still have to bring what are likely to be challenging cases applying the new laws (see Section F). The adoption, setting up, and bedding in of new legislation or regulatory structures and bodies is therefore unlikely to happen very quickly and is, consequently, unlikely to meet the demands of those seeking urgent and immediate action now.</p><p>These difficulties suggest that for the near future, at least, the agencies will have to achieve successful extensions of policy mainly through launching themselves into a number of lengthy, complex investigations and litigation based on the current regime. This means establishing violations under existing judicial interpretations of the antitrust laws and making a convincing case for the imposition of effective remedies, including structural relief.</p><p>The discussion in this section identifies likely impediments to the implementation of ambitious reforms, either through litigation (under the present-day regime) or legislation. These include judicial resistance to broader applications of the Sherman, Clayton, and FTC Acts, the complexities of designing effective remedies, the uncertainty of long-term political support for ambitious reforms and the possibilities for political backlash once agencies begin prosecuting major new cases, and the complications, and resistance, that confronts any effort in the United States to make legislative change.</p><h>A. Judicial Resistance to Extensions of Existing Antitrust Doctrine</h><p>As noted in Section II.A, judicial decisions since the mid-1970s have reshaped antitrust law; created more permissive substantive standards governing dominant firm conduct, mergers, and vertical restraints; and raised the bar to antitrust claims in a number of ways. This remolding has been facilitated by the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Sherman Act constitutes \u201ca special kind of common law offense,\u201d 81  so that Congress \u201cexpected the courts to give shape to the statute\u2019s broad mandate by drawing on common-law tradition.\u201d 82  This has allowed the statutory commands to be interpreted flexibly and the law to evolve with new circumstances and new wisdom; 83  for example, where there is widespread agreement that the previous position is inappropriate or where the theoretical underpinnings of those decisions have been called into question. 84 </p><p>The proposed solutions will depend, in the short term at least, on the ability of enforcement agencies to navigate the described jurisprudence to find an antitrust infringement and, in some instances, a further rethinking, refinement, and/or development of doctrine, through softening, modification, or even a reversal of current case law. Although such an evolution could, in theory, result, as it did over the last forty years, from a steady stream of antitrust cases, judicial appointments since 2017 have arguably made such a change in direction unlikely. Rather, it seems more probable that successful prosecution of major antitrust, and especially Section 2 Sherman Act monopolization cases, will remain challenging and may even become more difficult. Cases will be litigated before judges who are ordinarily predisposed to accept the current framework, either by personal preference or by a felt compulsion to abide by forty years of jurisprudence that tells them to do so. 85  A new president could gradually change the philosophy of the federal courts by appointing judges sympathetic to the aims of the proposed transformation. 86  The reorientation of the courts through judicial appointments is, however, likely to take a long time. 87 </p><p>Until then, trial judges and the Court of Appeals will be compelled to abide by the existing jurisprudence and will only be at liberty to develop a more flexible approach in the \u201cgaps\u201d or spaces left by Supreme Court opinions\u2014for example, in relation to mergers and rebates\u2014and through creative interpretations of the law. Such cases are, however, likely to be hard fought. Indeed, Judge Lucy Koh\u2019s finding in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm, Inc.</emphasis> 88  that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices constituted unlawful monopolization of the market for certain telecommunications chips has provoked hostile attacks, not only from practitioners and academics but also from the DOJ, the U.S. Departments of Defense and Energy, and even one of the FTC\u2019s own members. In a scathing op-ed in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis>, 89  Commissioner Christine Wilson attacked Judge Koh\u2019s \u201cstartling new creation\u201d of legal obligations that may trigger a new wave of enforcement actions and undermine intellectual property rights. Commissioner Wilson condemned the judge\u2019s \u201cjudicial innovations,\u201d and \u201calchemy,\u201d through reviving and expanding the Supreme Court\u2019s 1985 opinion in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aspen Skiing Co v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp</emphasis> 90  (which she stresses was described by the Supreme Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trinko</emphasis> 91  as \u201cat or near the outer boundary\u201d of U.S. antitrust law), turning contractual obligations into antitrust claims, and for departing from current federal agency practice, by imposing remedies requiring Qualcomm to negotiate or renegotiate contracts with customers and competitors worldwide. She has thus urged the Ninth Circuit (on appeal), and if necessary the Supreme Court, to assess the wisdom of these sweeping changes and to stay the ruling. 92 </p><p>It seems likely therefore that, at the same time as bringing cases seeking to develop procedural, evidential, and substantive antitrust standards under the existing regime, additional antidotes to the stringencies of existing jurisprudence will be required, including more extensive, and expansive, use of Section 5 FTC Act to plug the gaps created by the narrowing of the scope of Section 2 Sherman Act; and/or the adoption of legislation that directs courts to apply a wider goals framework.</p><h>B. Infirmities of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act</h><p>One possible solution to rigidities that have developed in Sherman Act jurisprudence is for the FTC to rely more heavily on the prosecution, through its own administrative process, of cases based on Section 5 of the FTC Act and its prohibition of \u201cunfair methods of competition.\u201d 93  This section allows the FTC 94  to tackle not only anticompetitive practices prohibited by the other antitrust statutes but also conduct constituting incipient violations of those statutes or behavior that exceeds their reach. The latter is possible where the conduct does not infringe the letter of the antitrust laws but contradicts their basic spirit or public policy. 95 </p><p>There is no doubt therefore that Section 5 was designed as an expansion joint in the U.S. antitrust system. It seems unlikely to us, nonetheless, that a majority of FTC\u2019s current members will be minded to use it in this way. Further, even if they were to be, the reality is that such an application may encounter difficulties. Since its creation in 1914, the FTC has never prevailed before the Supreme Court in any case challenging dominant firm misconduct, whether premised on Section 2 of the Sherman Act or purely on Section 5 of the FTC Act. 96  The last FTC success in federal court in a case predicated solely on Section 5 occurred in the late 1960s. 97 </p><p>The FTC\u2019s record of limited success with Section 5 has not been for want of trying. In the 1970s, the FTC undertook an ambitious program to make the enforcement of claims predicated on the distinctive reach of Section 5, a foundation to develop \u201ccompetition policy in its broadest sense.\u201d 98  The agency\u2019s Section 5 agenda yielded some successes, 99  but also a large number of litigation failures involving cases to address subtle forms of coordination in oligopolies, to impose new obligations on dominant firms, and to dissolve shared monopolies. 100  The agency\u2019s program elicited powerful legislative backlash from a Congress that once supported FTC\u2019s trailblazing initiatives but turned against it as the Commission\u2019s efforts to obtain dramatic structural remedies unfolded. 101 </p><h>C. Designing Effective Remedies</h><p>Important issues arising for the new enforcement strategy proposed will be what remedies should be sought; how can an order, or decree, be fashioned to ensure that the violation is terminated, that competition on the market is restored, the opportunity for competition is re-established, and that future violations are not committed and deterred; and will a court be likely to impose any such remedy. 102 </p><p>The Sherman Act treats infringements of its key commands as crimes attracting severe sanctions, including fines (corporate and individual) and imprisonment. Although since 1980, the DOJ has used criminal prosecutions only to challenge hard-core horizontal cartels, 103  some antitrust reform proponents are calling for the introduction of fines to sanction illegal monopolization, and some commentators have proposed that the DOJ reconsider its policy of not seeking criminal penalties beyond the Section 1 conspiracy context. 104  For the time being, however, it would appear that existing civil sanctions will remain the tool of choice for DOJ in dealing with antitrust infringements and will be the only set of remedies available to the FTC, which has no mandate to bring criminal cases.</p><p>The civil remedial options, which can broadly be grouped into three categories, for the federal agencies, are nonetheless powerful in principle. The first and, perhaps, the most common form of remedy consists of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">controls on conduct</emphasis>. Conduct-related relief ordinarily takes the form of cease and desist orders that forbid certain behavior or, in a smaller number of cases, compel firms to engage in affirmative acts, such as providing a competitor access to an asset needed to compete.</p><p>The second major form of remedy is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">structural relief</emphasis> in the form of divestitures or the compulsory licensing of intellectual property that enables a firm to enter a previously monopolized market. The boundary between purely conduct-based and structural remedies is not always clear. A compulsory licensing decree has strong structural features (it directly facilitates new entry) and conduct elements (it may require the owner of the patent to provide the licensee know-how and updates of the patented technology).</p><p>The third remedy consists of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">civil monetary relief</emphasis> in the form of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains or the restitution of monopoly overcharges to victims. A number of Supreme Court decisions in monopolization cases in the late 1940s and early 1950s appeared to hold that these forms of recovery are encompassed in the mandate of courts to order equitable remedies to cure antitrust violations. The federal agencies have not used this power expansively, though it would appear to be available to recoup overcharges in Section 2 or other cases. 105 </p><p>The cures envisaged by many of the advocates of change call for the bold application of the full portfolio of civil remedies, including unwinding past mergers, divestment of assets, restructuring concentrated markets, limiting or reversing vertical integration or through the imposition of licensing obligations. Such advocates thus wish the DOJ and FTC to use the antitrust laws as an effective and simple mechanism for deconcentrating both monopolistic and oligopolistic markets, rapidly introducing new competition into a market; and reversing what they consider to be severe structural problems that have been allowed to develop on the market. 106 </p><p>Structural remedies, in particular, have always been a real and important part of the antitrust remedial arsenal, 107  not only in merger cases where a violation of the antitrust rules may consist of an unlawful acquisition of shares or stock 108  but also in Sherman Act cases. 109  In the 1960s the FTC also sought, using its powers under Section 5 FTC Act to deconcentrate the petrol and breakfast cereal markets 110  and in 1969 the Neal Report, 111  commissioned by President Lyndon Johnson, proposed the adoption of laws which would allow oligopolistic industries to be deconcentrated and the condemnation of mergers on markets that were already concentrated. 112 </p><p>Modern antitrust has, however, had less appetite for the use of antitrust to break up companies. Although the District Court in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States v Microsoft Corp</emphasis> 113  ordered, at the request of the DOJ, that Microsoft be broken into two parts, the Court of Appeals, despite affirming the violation of section 2, reversed and remanded the finding that Microsoft should be split into two. Setting out a high bar for structural relief, the Court stressed that the lower court had not (1) held a remedies-specific hearing 114  or (2) provided adequate reasons for the decreed remedies. 115 </p><p>A number of factors seem responsible for the trend away from structural remedies. First, the change in antitrust thinking that has evolved since the early 1970s, from a belief that antitrust intervention and structural remedies can improve performance 116  to the current more laissez-faire one. 117  Second, concerns about the effectiveness of previous attempts to deconcentrate industries, 118  especially given the length of time that antitrust proceedings take. 119  Third, the difficulty involved in constructing and overseeing a structural remedy effectively. Although in cases involving a merger or acquisition it may be relatively easy to structure such a remedy through disentangling assets that were once owned separately, 120  outside of this situation, the question of how and what to divest might be much more speculative, seem much more risky and may in fact be complex and difficult to administer (involving significant restructuring, separation of physical facilities, and allocation of staff from integrated teams). 121  These types of concern make it a challenge to persuade a court that a structural remedy is warranted and will be successful in achieving its objective. 122 </p><p>In the discussion above, we have been addressing the types of remedies that are imposed at the conclusion of a lawsuit. A problem in highly dynamic markets, however, is that the lag between the initiation of a case and a final order on relief may be so great that market circumstances have changed dramatically or the victim of allegedly improper exclusion may have left the market or otherwise lost its opportunity to expand and contest the position of the incumbent dominant firm. In this context, the antitrust cure arrives far too late to protect competition. The relatively slow pace of antitrust investigations and litigation (with appeals that follow an initial decision) has led some observers to doubt the efficacy of antitrust cases as effective policy-making tools in dynamic commercial sectors.</p><p>There are at least five possible responses to concerns about the speed of antitrust litigation, particularly matters involving dominant firms. First, agencies could experiment with ways to accelerate investigations, and courts could adopt innovative techniques to shorten the length of trials. In the United States, we perceive that greater integration of effort among the public agencies would permit the more rapid completion of investigations (e.g., by pooling knowledge and focusing more resources on the collection and evaluation of evidence). Courts could use methods tested with success in the DOJ prosecution of Microsoft in the late 1990s to truncate the presentation of evidence. These types of measures have some promise to bring matters to a close more quickly.</p><p>Second, the initiation of a lawsuit could be recognized as being, in some important ways, its own remedy; the prosecution of a case by itself causes the firm to change its behavior in ways that give rivals more breathing room to grow. Moreover, the visible presence of the enforcement authority, manifest by its investigations and lawsuits, causes other firms to reconsider tactics that arguably violate the law. Seen in this light, the entry of a final order that specifies remedies may not be necessary for all instances to have the desired chastening effect.</p><p>A third response is to experiment more broadly with interim relief that seeks to suspend certain types of exclusionary conduct pending the completion of the full trial. 123  Effective interim measures would require the enforcement agency to develop a base of knowledge about the sector that enables it to accurately identify the practices to be enjoined on an interim basis and to give judges a confident basis for intervening in this manner.</p><p>A fourth approach would be that the remedies achieved in protracted antitrust litigation may not be so imperfect or untimely as they might appear to be. There have been a number of instances in which the remedy achieved in a monopolization case was rebuked as desperately insufficient when ordered but turned out to have positive competitive consequences. 124  This is a humbling and difficult aspect of policy making. It may not be easy for an agency to persuade its political overseers\u2014or other external audiences\u2014that the chief benefits of its intervention will emerge in, say, two or three decades. Yet the positive results may take a long time to become apparent.</p><p>A fifth technique would be to rely more heavily on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ex-ante</emphasis> regulation in the form of trade regulation rules that forbid certain practices. A competition authority\u2014most likely the FTC\u2014would use its rulemaking powers to proscribe specific types of conduct (e.g., self-preferencing by dominant information services platforms).</p><p>In this article, we do not purport to solve the problems of the remedial design set out above. There is, however, a fairly clear conclusion about how enforcement agencies should go about thinking of remedies. As we note below, there is considerable room for public agencies to design remedies more effectively by systematically examining past experience and collaborating with external researchers to identify superior techniques. In this regard, the FTC\u2019s collection of policy tools would appear to make it the ideal focal point for the development of more effective approaches to remedial design.</p><h>D. Political Backlash</h><p>As we have already indicated, the government\u2019s prosecution of high stakes antitrust cases often inspires defendants to lobby elected officials to rein in the enforcement agency. Targets of cases that seek to impose powerful remedies have several possible paths to encourage politicians to blunt enforcement measures. One path is to seek intervention from the President. The Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division serves at the will of the President, making DOJ policy dependent on the President\u2019s continuing support. The White House ordinarily does not guide the Antitrust Division\u2019s selection of cases, but there have been instances in which the President pressured the Division to alter course on behalf of a defendant, and did so successfully. 125 </p><p>The second path is to lobby the Congress. The FTC is called an \u201cindependent\u201d regulatory agency, but Congress interprets independence in an idiosyncratic way. 126  Legislators believe independence means insulation from the executive branch, not from the legislature. The FTC is dependent on a good relationship with Congress, which controls its budget and can react with hostility, and forcefully, when it disapproves of FTC litigation\u2014particularly where it adversely affects the interests of members\u2019 constituents. Controversial and contested cases may consequently be derailed or muted if political support for them wanes and politicians become more sympathetic to commercial interests. The FTC\u2019s sometimes tempestuous relationship with Congress demonstrates that political coalitions favoring bold enforcement can be volatile, unpredictable, and evanescent. 127  If the FTC does not manage its relationship with Congress carefully, its litigation opponents may mobilize legislative intervention that causes ambitious enforcement measures to the founder.</p><p>Imagine, for a moment, that the DOJ and the FTC launch monopolization cases against each of the GAFA giants. Among other grounds, these cases might be premised on the theory that the firms used mergers to accumulate and protect positions of dominance. The GAFA firms have received unfavorable scrutiny from legislators from both political parties over the past few years, but the current wave of political opprobrium is unlikely to discourage the firms from bringing their formidable lobbying resources to bear upon the Congress. It would be hazardous for the enforcement agencies to assume that a sustained, well-financed lobbying campaign will be ineffective. At a minimum, the agencies would need to consider how many battles they can fight at one time, and how to foster a countervailing coalition of business interests to oppose the defendants.</p><h>E. Opposition to Legislative Reform</h><p>Although statutory reform might at first sight appear to be a direct, effective solution to some of the impediments (such as entrenched judicial resistance to intervention), there are good reasons to expect that powerful business interests will also stoutly oppose any proposals for legislation to expand the reach of the antitrust laws or to create a new digital regulator. 128  One can envisage the formidable financial and political resources of the affected firms will amass to stymie far-reaching legislative reforms. Legislative steps that threaten the structure, operations, and profitability of the Tech Giants and other leading firms are fraught with political risk. These risks are surmountable, but only by means of a clever strategy that anticipates and blunts political pressure. One element of such a strategy is to mobilize countervailing support from consumer and business interests to sustain an enabling political environment to enact ambitious new laws.</p><p>Even if successful, \u201c[l]egislative relief from existing jurisprudential structures might take years to accomplish\u201d; 129  acts taken under new legislation\u2014even with the establishment of presumptions that improve the litigation position of government plaintiffs\u2014may still be relatively complex and difficult to prosecute. Rulemaking is an alternative to litigation, but it is no easy way out of the problem. On the contrary, promulgation and defense, in litigation, of a major trade regulation rule is liable to take as long as the prosecution of a Section 2 case. It can also be anticipated that a judiciary populated with many regulation skeptics will subject new rules or related measures to demanding scrutiny.</p><h>IV. Optimal Implementation Approaches</h><h>A. Finding a Path</h><p>In Section III, we described the obstacles that are likely to stand in the way of accomplishing a significant reconstruction of U.S. antitrust doctrine and enforcement policy. To some degree, the severity of the obstacles depends on how ambitious the chosen reform program turns out to be. The aims and means of the \u201cdo more with what you have\u201d group are challenging enough, but they pale in comparison to the difficulties presented by the proposals of the root-and-branch transformation advocates. The latter group would place greater demands on the implementing institutions through, for example, initiating a larger number of major cases and seeking more powerful structural remedies, and by insisting that the entire program be undertaken quickly and decisively rather than at a more moderate tempo.</p><p>Although successful accomplishment and delivery of reforms, more moderate and more ambitious, alike, will require awareness and a realistic assessment of likely implementation obstacles and a conscious effort to develop a strategy to surmount them (it has been seen that history provides sobering examples of failures where similar, significant implementation barriers have not been considered or have been discounted 130 ), such barriers are not a formula for timidity or a reason not to undertake change. Rather, understanding them helps guide the design of a successful program. To return to our U.S. space program analogy, 131  an indispensable foundation for the ultimate success of the Apollo program was the commitment of National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its contractors to understand the full magnitude of the task before them and to anticipate all hazards that would confront human spaceflight to and from the Moon\u2019s surface. 132  The probing analysis of risks inspired successful efforts to find solutions. Operating in an unforgiving environment where even small errors could be catastrophic, humans landed on the Moon and returned safely to Earth.</p><p>This section consequently discusses approaches for navigating the reform implementation challenges. Our most important caution is that the reforms\u2014more dramatic and less sweeping\u2014will require substantial upgrades in the capabilities and performance of the institutions responsible for implementation. The more ambitious the reform, the more urgent is the need to enhance capabilities. Further, the prospects of success for the public agencies (federal and state) are likely to improve if they can formulate a common strategy to overcome identified obstacles. Doing so will demand planned, joined-up, and consensual enforcement by the public enforcement agencies and a forthright self-assessment of existing operations and capabilities\u2014to repair institutional flaws, to temper interagency disagreements, and to acquire the human capital needed to run a new, large collection of difficult antitrust suits.</p><h>B. Augmenting the Human Capital of the Enforcement Agencies</h><p>Measures to expand federal antitrust intervention dramatically\u2014through the prosecution of lawsuits or the promulgation of trade regulation rules\u2014will face arduous opposition from the affected businesses. Assuming that litigation will provide the main method in the coming few years to attack positions of single-firm or collective dominance, the targets of big antitrust cases will marshal the best talent that private law firms, economic consultancies, and academic bodies can offer to oppose the government in court. The defense will benefit from doctrinal principles that generally are sympathetic to dominant firms (again, we assume that legislation to change the doctrinal status quo will not be immediately forthcoming). Beyond a certain point, the addition of new, high stakes cases to the litigation portfolio of public antitrust agencies will create a serious gap between the teams assembled for the prosecution and defense, respectively. Although therefore the public agencies can match the private sector punch for the punch when prosecuting several major de-monopolization cases, when the volume of such cases rises from several to many, the government agencies may have to rely on personnel with considerably less experience to develop and prosecute difficult antitrust cases, seeking powerful remedies upon global giants.</p><p>An enhanced litigation program will therefore go only as far as the talent of the agencies will carry it. We propose three steps to build and retain the human capital\u2014attorneys, economists, technologists, and administrative managers 133 \u2014to undertake a more ambitious litigation program. The first is to use antitrust as a prototype for a program to raise civil service salaries. The second two steps consist of cautions about the dangers of (a) denigrating the skills and accomplishments of existing agency personnel and (b) attempting to shut the revolving door through which professionals move between the public and private sectors. We discuss all three of these steps below.</p><h>1. Resources and compensation</h><p>To accomplish the desired expansion of enforcement, we see a need for more resources. 134  Nonetheless, budget increases that simply allow the enforcement agencies to hire additional staff, while useful, are not enough. We would use more resources to boost compensation for agency employees. This means taking the antitrust agencies out of the existing civil service pay scale. The need is not simply to hire more people. It is to attract a larger number of elite personnel who are equal to the tasks that the ambitious reform agenda will impose. We do not see how the public agencies can recruit and retain necessary personnel without a significant increase in the salaries paid to case handlers and to senior managers. It surprises us that none of the proposals for bold reform mention compensation for civil servants.</p><p>Consider two possibilities for compensation reform. The first is to align antitrust salaries to the highest scale paid to the financial service regulators. Here the model would be the scale of salaries paid to employees of the U.S. banking regulatory agencies; the salary scale for these regulatory bodies exceeds the General Schedule federal civil service wage scale by roughly 20%. 135  A second alternative involves a more dramatic change, perhaps more easily accomplished at the FTC, which is a self-contained agency, than at the DOJ Antitrust Division, which is a relatively small part of a much larger bureaucracy. One might take the FTC\u2019s existing budget of about $330 million per year and triple it, setting the amount at $1 billion per year and use the increase to raise salaries. We would conduct this experiment for a decade to test whether a major hike in pay would increase the agency\u2019s ability to recruit the best talent and keep the talent at home for a significant period of time.</p><p>We see this as a crucial test of the commitment and sincerity of the political leadership that seeks basic change. If fundamental competition policy reforms mean so much to the nation\u2019s well-being, then the country will need to pay to achieve it. Such steps will become even more important if new political leadership seeks to close the revolving door, which has operated as a mechanism to encourage attorneys and economists to accept lower salaries in federal service in the expectation of receiving much higher compensation in the private sector at a later time.</p><h>2. Respecting Past Achievements</h><p>In the United States, there is an unfortunate habit of making the case for major reforms by depicting the existing policy-making institutions as utterly incompetent, slothful, or corrupt. 136  Reform advocates sometimes appear to believe that any recognition that existing institutions sometimes have done good work undermines the case for fundamental reform. There is a perceived imperative to portray the responsible bodies and their leaders as hopelessly inadequate. Electoral campaigns can sharpen this tendency by leading the opposition party to claim that the incumbent administration\u2019s program was an unrelieved failure.</p><p>In a striking number of instances, this pattern has emerged in discussions of antitrust policy. 137  In current discussions about the future of the U.S. antitrust regime, advocates of fundamental reform sometimes portray the federal antitrust enforcement agencies as decrepit\u2014perhaps to underscore the need for basic change. 138  The proponents of root-and-branch transformation often suggest that only a complete makeover of the antitrust system will enable antitrust law to fulfill its intended role. The implication is that, because the antitrust system has failed so miserably, there are few, if any, positive lessons to be derived from experience since the retrenchment of U.S. policy began in the late 1970s, and certainly none since 2000.</p><p>This style of argument has several potential costs. One danger is that it overlooks genuine accomplishments and, in doing so, ignores experience that suggests how to build successful programs in the future. Consider three examples that deserve close study in building future cases that seek to expand the reach of the antitrust system. The first is the development of the FTC\u2019s pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical health-care program from the mid-1970s forward; this initiative used the full range of the agency\u2019s policy tools\u2014cases, rules, reports, and advocacy\u2014to change doctrine and alter business behavior. 139  A second example is the FTC\u2019s effort over the past two decades to restore the effectiveness of the quick look as an analytical tool in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Federal Trade Commission v. California Dental Association</emphasis>. 140  A third example is the FTC\u2019s successful litigation of three cases before the Supreme Court over the past decade. 141 </p><p>The programs that accounted for these results were not accidental. Each program began with a careful examination of the existing framework of doctrine and policy to identify desired areas of extension. This stock-taking guided the identification of potential candidates for cases and the application of other policy-making tools. 142  Each program built incrementally upon the bipartisan contributions of agency leadership and the sustained commitment of staff across several presidential administrations headed by Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>If one assumes (as a number of reform proponents assert) that the FTC was a useless body in the modern era, there would be little purpose in studying these examples, or anything else it did, as there would be nothing useful to learn. The paint-it-black interpretation of modern antitrust history makes the costly error of tossing aside experience that might inform the successful implementation of new reforms.</p><p>A second notable cost of the catastrophe narrative, most relevant to the discussion of human capital, is its demoralizing effect on the agency\u2019s existing managers and staff. To see one\u2019s previous work portrayed as substandard, or worse, tends not to inspire superior effort. It breeds cynicism and distrust, where managers and staff understand that the critique badly distorts what they have done. Proponents of basic change must realize that the success of their program to expand antitrust intervention will require major contributions from existing staff and managers.</p><h>3. Capture and the Revolving Door</h><p>The modern critique of the U.S. system often describes the federal agencies as captured by the business community or beholden to ideas that disfavor robust intervention. 143  Advocates of change suggest that the execution of their reform program at the federal antitrust agencies will require the appointment of senior managers and new staff who repudiate the consumer welfare standard, or at least embrace a vision for expanded enforcement under the consumer welfare, and embrace the multidimensional conception of the proper goals of competition law. Those already employed by the enforcement agencies as managers and staff will be expected to accept the expanded (goals) framework or they will find their duties reduced and their roles marginalized. New appointees to top leadership positions will not be tainted by substantial previous experience in the private sector, nor will they have spent too much time as civil servants in a government enforcement culture that assumed the primacy of consumer welfare as the aim of antitrust law and accepted norms that tilted toward underenforcement. The concern about compromised motives is also likely to disqualify many academics who, though sympathetic to some expansion of antitrust enforcement, remain excessively beholden to some notion of a consumer (rather than citizen) welfare standard, or have engaged in consulting on behalf of large corporate interests.</p><p>One consequence of the acute anxiety about capture is to slam the revolving door shut, or at least to slow the rate at which it spins. We offer two cautions about this approach. First, the modern experience of the FTC raises reasons to question the strength of the theory. For example, if business perspectives dominate the FTC, why did the agency persist in its efforts to challenge reverse payment agreements involving leading pharmaceutical producers? 144  Was it because the pharmaceutical firms weren\u2019t as good at lobbying as, say, the information services giants? And what explains the FTC\u2019s decision to sue Qualcomm for monopolization early in 2017? 145  Is this simply attributable to the inadequacy of Qualcomm\u2019s Washington, DC, lobbyists, or is the capture explanation for the behavior of the federal antitrust agencies not entirely airtight?</p><p>Our second caution is that severe restrictions on the revolving door could deny the federal agencies access to skills they will need to carry out a major expansion of antitrust enforcement. Recruiting attorneys, economists, and other specialists from the private sector can give the agencies a vital infusion of talent which, when combined with agency careerists, permit the creation of project teams that can equal the capability of the best teams that the defense can mount in major litigation matters. We also are wary of the idea that an attorney or economist coming from the private sector will discourage effective intervention during the period of public service as a way to pave the road to a better private sector position upon leaving the agency. Rather, there is evidence to suggest that creating a reputation for aggressiveness and toughness as an enforcer increases one\u2019s post-agency employment options. More than a few individuals have development prosperous careers based on piloting businesses through navigational hazards that they helped create while they were senior officials in public agencies.</p><h>C. Common Public Enforcement Strategy</h><p>The U.S. antitrust system is famous for its decentralization of the power to prosecute, giving many entities\u2014public agencies (at both the federal and state levels), consumers, and businesses\u2014competence to enforce the federal antitrust laws. The federal enforcement regime also coexists with state antitrust laws and with sectoral regulation, at the national and state levels, that includes a competition policy mandate.</p><p>The extraordinary decentralization and multiplicity of enforcement mechanisms supply valuable possibilities for experimentation and provide safeguards in case any single enforcement agent is disabled (e.g., due to capture, resource austerity, or corruption). 146  Among public agencies, there is also the possibility that federal and state government institutions, while preserving the benefits of experimentation and redundancy, could improve performance through cooperation that allows them to perform tasks collectively that each could accomplish with great difficulty, or not at all, if they act in isolation. For models of successful interagency cooperation, one might study the successful policy integration that has taken place through the work of the United Kingdom Competition Network and the European Competition Network. In both examples, one can see the mix of organizational structures and personal leadership that enabled agencies collectively to accomplish policy results that would have been unattainable through the work of single agencies operating in isolation.</p><p>We doubt the ambitious litigation agenda demanded in the modern reform proposals is attainable if the public agencies adhere to traditional practices that overlook the expansion of outcome and increase in quality that superior interagency cooperation could generate. A suggested program of fuller integration would have the following elements.</p><h>1. Development of a Common Strategy</h><p>The path toward a major expansion of the existing litigation program will require careful planning that begins with the formulation of a joined-up strategy implemented harmoniously by the DOJ and FTC. The starting point for the common strategy is to map out the existing contours of doctrine, identify the high ground for intervention that modern jurisprudence has established, select projects to reshape doctrine and other elements of antitrust policy, allocate them to the best-placed agency to act and avoid duplication of resources on identical or overlapping investigations.</p><p>A second focal point in the analysis of the doctrinal status quo would be to consider how existing precedents can be employed to build successful cases and how doctrinal frontiers can be extended. 147  An important element of this mapping exercise is to understand why the courts have embraced more permissive standards over the past four decades. This assessment would facilitate the preparation of effective arguments to persuade judges to rethink it. Among other effects, we anticipate that this inquiry will reveal how perspectives beyond the modern Chicago School have influenced judicial thinking. In particular, it will demonstrate how a number of jurists have abandoned a multidimensional goals framework in favor of an efficiency orientation out of concern for \u201cadministrability\u201d considerations posed by the modern Harvard School of Phillip Areeda and Donald Turner. To gain the support of jurists such as Stephen Breyer (whose antitrust views bear the mark of Areeda\u2019s influence), it will be necessary to show that the restoration of a new antitrust framework, or an egalitarian goals framework, would not lead to unpredictable and inconsistent litigation outcomes as each judge sought to weigh efficiency concerns or efficiency concerns alongside other values, such as preserving opportunities for small enterprises to compete. 148 </p><p>The third element of common strategy would be lessons derived from the examination of the agencies\u2019 base of experience to determine what combination of policy tools\u2014cases, studies, rules, advocacy\u2014offer the best means to effectuate change in the market and to use this experience base to design specific remedies. Since its creation in 1890, the U.S. competition law system has generated a mass of information about the techniques for government intervention. As explained further below, the government\u2019s \u201cbig antitrust data\u201d can be mined to shed light on what is likely to work. For example, experience in implementing major structural remedies pursuant to decrees in Section 2 monopolization cases and by legislation such as the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 offer important lessons about how to design and carry out the restructuring of major business enterprises. 149 </p><p>The study of past experience also reveals that it is a mistake, as part of a reform program, to focus all of an agency\u2019s resources on the prosecution of big cases against big companies to the exclusion of smaller matters. The history of U.S. Section 2 enforcement shows that small cases can make big law by establishing doctrinal principles that support subsequent successful prosecutions of large enterprises. 150 </p><h>2. Project Selection Methodology</h><p>Project selection is the process by which an antitrust agency chooses the tools it will use to accomplish its policy aims. There is growing recognition among antitrust authorities that improvements in the methodology of project selection can strengthen the prospects of success for any single initiative. Adapted for the purpose of executing a major reform program, a good project selection methodology would pose a series of questions about every proposed initiative. 151 </p><p>First, what does the agency expect to achieve if the project succeeds? Will it improve economic conditions, realign doctrine, or both? By defining anticipated gains, the agency can better understand how many resources to commit to a specific measure and make a better informed decision about how much risk to accept. This inquiry also helps focus the agency\u2019s attention, from the earliest days of the project\u2019s preparation, on the design of remedies to cure apparent problems. The consideration of benefits to be attained and the means for realizing them can lead an agency to reflect carefully about whether the proposed project is the best way to solve the problem at hand. In some instances, a different sequence of initiatives may provide the best path to a solution\u2014for example, to begin with a market study, and then bring cases based on the learning from the study.</p><p>Second, what risks does the project pose? How will a project failure\u2014such as a litigation defeat\u2014affect the market and the agency? Will the agency be able to sustain political support for its projects, or will the targets of intervention mobilize a political coalition to constrain the agency by, for example, curbing its authority or budget? To succeed, agencies must be mindful of the shifting sands in politics and be prepared with countermeasures to deal with situations where relevant politicians\u2019 interests change and become more sympathetic to commercial interests. Important issues therefore will be whether current political supporters of reform have the staying power to back agencies for the five to ten years it might take to carry out cases successfully, what steps agencies can take to ensure sustained political support and to deal with swings in the political environment and whether financial support from the affected firms may be used to sway, or can be prevented from swaying, the political process and buckle political resolve.</p><p>Third, who will carry out the project? Which agency and does that agency have the talent available, or can it acquire needed talent in a timely manner, to perform the project successfully and overcome the opposition it will face where the agency seeks strong remedies for individual firms or entire sectors of the economy? A clear-headed answer to these questions helps avoid the creation of large gaps between the agency\u2019s commitments and its ability to fulfill them in practice. Because it may be better attuned to the agency\u2019s capabilities, a more gradual approach to rolling out a reform program may have better prospects for success than the launch of a number of large, complex cases all at the same time. One of the biggest hazards we see especially in the root-and-branch reform agenda is that it entails the rapid commencement of many ambitious projects that will place impossible demands on the capabilities of the antitrust agencies.</p><p>Fourth, what will the project cost be in terms of personnel and out-of-pocket expenditures for items such as expert witnesses to support cases? This inquiry helps the agency make a realistic prediction of the resources needed to carry out individual projects and prepare disciplined estimates for future budget requests.</p><p>How long will it take the agency to complete the project? This inquiry helps the agency determine whether its anticipated intervention and remedy will occur fast enough to solve an observed problem. If years may pass before the agency obtains a desired remedy at the conclusion of a lawsuit, it may be necessary to consider interim measures to correct the behavior that poses immediate competitive dangers if allowed to continue. By establishing an expected timetable at the outset, the agency equips its leadership with a valuable management tool to track a project\u2019s progress.</p><p>How does the proposed project fit into the portfolio of the agency\u2019s existing projects? If the agency examines each project in isolation, it can lose sight of the overall condition of its program portfolio. A portfolio-wide perspective enables the agency to assess the full range of risks it has assumed and, again, to see that it is achieving a good fit between its commitments and its capabilities.</p><p>How will the agency know that the project, if undertaken, is having its desired effects? It is a helpful exercise to identify how an agency\u2019s intervention will bring about change in the market. What are the anticipated effects on prices, product quality, new business entry, or other economic conditions? When are these effects likely to become apparent? This exercise helps the agency develop realistic expectations about the magnitude and timing of anticipated benefits. From its past experience, the agency may be aware that some benefits may take years\u2014perhaps decades\u2014to become apparent.</p><p>The specification of performance benchmarks also plays a crucial role in facilitating the ex-post evaluation of outcomes. A very basic form of assessment is to compare the agency\u2019s assumptions about a project when it begins with the knowledge it gains in the course of implementation. If anticipated performance falls below expectations (perhaps because a significant factor was overlooked), how can the project selection process be improved to account for the factor in the future? Taking careful stock of past measures that worked\u2014and learning lessons from the failures\u2014is a vital way to design new initiatives more effectively.</p><h>D. Enabling the FTC to Perform Its Intended Function</h><p>A number of the proposals for expansive reform would give the FTC a broader and fuller role in formulating competition policy. Several features of its original design make the Commission an attractive vehicle for carrying out a program of basic reforms. It has been seen that the FTC Act gives the Commission a broad, scalable mandate (Section 5\u2019s prohibition on \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d) to prohibit behavior not reached by existing interpretations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The agency also has expansive authority to collect information from firms through compulsory processes and to publish reports. 152  The statute also intended that the Commission serve as a special resource to the DOJ and to the courts in formulating remedies in antitrust cases. 153 </p><p>Under the program of greater interagency cooperation we have proposed above, the FTC would use Section 5 of the FTC to seek to extend the boundaries of existing doctrine and to use its information gathering and reporting powers to set the empirical basis for proposed extensions. The starting point for this effort would be to examine the agency\u2019s past (and rare) Section 5 litigation successes for lessons about how to gain judicial acceptance for an extension of antitrust doctrine. 154  The Commission also would serve, in effect, as the main public agency resource on remedies. The agency would use its analytical resources and experience in evaluating the effectiveness of antitrust remedies to guide the formulation of remedies in the Sherman Act and Clayton Act cases, in addition to Section 5 cases. The agency would employ the large body of experience that the U.S. system and other systems have collected in the use of structural and behavioral remedies to suggest solutions in specific cases.</p><p>We suggest three legislative changes to enable the Commission to fulfill the role we have described above. The first is to relax restrictions that the Government in the Sunshine Act 155  imposes on the ability of commissioners to deliberate together privately to discuss strategy and tactics. Among other consequences, the Sunshine Act severely limits the ability of a quorum of commissioners to discuss and debate matters of agency policy except in meetings open to the public. 156  The policy planning functions that we see as essential to an expanded role cannot be performed at a high level without this reform. 157 </p><p>A second essential step is to eliminate statutory exemptions that deny the FTC jurisdiction over common carriers, not for profit institutions, and banks. A third reform would confer powers on the FTC to conduct market studies, and obtain information necessary to allow it to carry out its functions, and market investigations in the same way as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). 158  For example, Part 4 of the Enterprise Act 2002 159  enables the CMA to investigate markets where it appears that the structure of the market or the conduct of suppliers or customers in the market is harming competition and, where problems are identified, to propose steps to mitigate, remedy, prevent, or overcome them. This would enable to FTC to study sectoral or economy-wide phenomena and to impose remedies regardless of whether the conditions or practices in question violate the antitrust laws.</p><h>V. Conclusions</h><p>In the United States, as in many other parts of the world, the pressure is on the competition agencies to make 2020, and the new decade, a period of sustained and effective antitrust action, targeting especially the business models of digital platforms. Pending any longer-term more fundamental reforms, many commentators are calling for immediate, rapid, and heightened competition scrutiny of a wide range of practices (including mergers (future and past), business practices of digital firms, restricted distribution and price setting practices) and the use of intrusive remedies to fix antitrust problems going forward.</p><p>These demands are imposing formidable expectations on the shoulders of competition agencies. Meeting them will not happen by chance or through a reactive and ad hoc approach. Indeed, without careful planning, an ambitious enforcement program involving a large number of complex litigations being pursued concurrently would risk agency managers and case handlers becoming overrun and the failure of the program. This paper consequently proposes a more tempered, gradual, and joined-up approach to reform, involving carefully constructed and coordinated strategies to overcome anticipated obstacles, painstaking planning and case allocation, and the selection of some initial complementary (but not overlapping) high-profile case prototypes for each agency to pursue before the program is expanded in steps.</p><p>Both federal agencies have investigative powers, but we propose that the FTC should make full use of its fact-finding powers to collect information on industries or sectors selected for investigation. Further, that before prosecutions are launched a methodology is followed for selecting appropriate cases for prosecution, taking account of past achievements and failures, the goal(s) to be achieved in bringing the case, the chance of success (especially given current doctrinal limitations), and opportunities for reshaping law and policy, the prospect for achieving those goals through antitrust action and remedies (rather than, for example, advocacy or other mechanisms), which agency is best placed to act, and whether that agency has the tools and staff available to take on the case now (taking account of other agency commitments). Essential to all of the proposals is a need for the agencies to anticipate and account for political backlash and for human capital in the agencies to be augmented. It will only be through recognizing the skills of existing staff and through finding realistic and achievable mechanisms to retain and recruit talented staff that the agencies will have the skill set diversity to take on sophisticated and powerful firms, backed by formidable teams of lawyers and experts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGEABX-1011770003603X20912884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGEABX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-RCM1-JBMY-H13H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470049</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"14222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sage Publications, Inc.

This allowed the witnesses, captains of the tech industry, to be in two places at once on July 27, 2020, when they testified before the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law. When it came to their conduct in their respective markets, the CEOs and the members of the Subcommittee also were in separate places.Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.; Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google parent Alphabet, Inc.; Tim Cook, CEO, Apple, Inc.; and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Inc. testified live via web video before the Subcommittee chaired by David N. Cicilline of Rhode Island. </p><p>The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on the Judiciary, chaired by Jerrold Nadler of New York. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey declined an invitation from Subcommittee Republicans, much to their irritation. As President Trump's favorite bullhorn, Twitter has drawn the attention of the commander in chief and his allies for flagging some of his tweets as violations of Twitter's 'abusive behavior' policy.To hear the CEOs tell it, their companies are building a better world. And in many ways they certainly are. This article was drafted on an Apple computer using Microsoft Word with some research performed via Google. It will be noticed on Twitter, and it may even make its way to a Facebook page near you. The CEOs say their platforms give individuals and businesses access to tools and information they would never have had before, and much of it for free, they said. They are socially and environmentally responsible. They are creating jobs. They connect people with each other, with valuable products and services, and with information in volumes never imagined. They are doing all of this in the face of stiff competition from larger players in specific segments as well as smaller innovators and disruptors snapping at their heels.To hear the Democratic members, the companies are ruthless, mercenary bullies who have little regard for fair competition or the privacy of individuals or companies. They use their dominance to act both as service providers and competitors against the retailers use their platforms. Their positions give them access to competitive information which makes them better able to compete with their own clients. Should any company start to give them a run for their money, these giants devour them. And, to hear some of the Republican members, the companies are biased against conservative points of view.Tech industry expert, author and commentator Kara Swisher wrote in a New York Times column that while she prefers 'public grillings with a side of shame,' it's a mistake to refer to these companies as Big Tech. '[T]hey are not a monolith and some in this group are further along in understanding that with great power comes great responsibility \u2014 and, more important, accountability.'We don't know which companies Swisher was talking about, but each CEO expressed warm regards for antitrust law and fair competition, and privacy, too. Here we have broken down what the CEOs wanted the Subcommittee to know, and what certain members of the Subcommittee, primarily Democrats, wanted the world to know about each corporation. What Bezos Wanted the Subcommittee to Know About Amazon, and Him. <url normalizedValue=\"https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Amazon-A-logo-1.pngAmazon\">https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Amazon-A-logo-1.pngAmazon</url> is a 'came from nothing' story.In his prepared statement, Bezos painted a picture of the American Dream. And that it is. A child of immigrants and humble beginnings, he explained how he grew Amazon from an idea funded by his parents' modest savings to not only one of the most successful companies in the history of capitalism, but one that contributes to the country and the world in a positive way. All the while, he said, the company does so in an 'extraordinarily competitive' environment.Amazon creates and protects jobs.Amazon has invested more than $270 billion in the U.S. during the last decade, Bezos said, creating nearly 700,000 indirect jobs to areas of the country that needed them most. During the COVID-19 crisis it has hired 175,000 employees, many of whom had lost jobs elsewhere.Amazon helps small businesses and creates jobs around the world, he said. 'There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores. More than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in our stores in 2019. On top of that, we estimate that third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world.'It's tough out there.'The global retail market we compete in is strikingly large and extraordinarily competitive,' he said. 'Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4% of retail in the U.S. [M]ore than 80 retailers in the U.S. alone earn over $1 billion in annual revenue Every day, Amazon competes against large, established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and, of course, Walmart\u2014a company more than twice Amazon's size.'Amazon is a positive force in the universe. Bezos told the lawmakers that Amazon is an environmentally and socially responsible corporation, too. It is committed to the zero-carbon goals of the Paris Agreement, purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from a Michigan manufacturer, operating 91 solar and wind projects, and investing $100 million in global reforestation. Amazon recently opened the largest homeless shelter in Washington state. It helps fund computer science education for thousands of children and young adults. It funds scholarships for low-income students. Amazon welcomes the antitrust probe.'Amazon should be scrutinized,' Bezos said, adding, though, so should 'all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits.'What the Subcommittee Wanted the World to Know about Amazon. Amazon uses competing sellers' data.In July 2019 Amazon attorney Nate Sutton testified that Amazon does not use any specific seller data when creating its own products. It's policy bars this practice. Since then, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon violates this policy, and it has been questioned how closely the policy is monitored or enforced. According to The Washington Post (owned by Bezos), the Amazon CEO 'testified that he couldn't confirm that the company didn't use data it collects regarding sales of products in its marketplace to launch its own private-label goods.'Amazon uses predatory pricing.In 2009, Diapers.com was Amazon's largest and fastest competitor in the diaper market. Amazon allegedly tried to get consumers not to purchase from its rival. In 2010 Amazon went after Diapers.com with promotional prices made low by Amazon's willingness to lose more than $2 million in a single month. Once Diapers.com was struggling, Amazon bought it, then increased the price of Amazon diapers.Amazon bullies and intimidates.One business owner, a bookseller, said Amazon uses fear and market power over smaller businesses; they are not treated like the valued partners Amazon would have everyone believe. The bookseller said that as sales grew they were eating into Amazon's market share. Without warning or explanation, Amazon allegedly retaliated by restricting their sales, which soon vanished. She said she sent more than 500 communications to Amazon, including to Bezos, himself, in the past year to address specific issues. There was not a single meaningful response from Amazon, the business owner said. Apparently numerous businesses reached out to Congress to share similar experiences. One small business owner who sells apparel to construction workers and firefighters, was making $60,000 a year on one product. Amazon launched a competing version at a lower price and drove the small business' sales to zero overnight.Amazon sellers have no real choice.Amazon has nearly seven times the market share of their closest ecommerce competitor. Small businesses have no real option; they must rely on Amazon to make online sales. There are 2.2 million active sellers on Amazon, and about 37% rely on Amazon as their sole source of income. This means more than 800,000 people are relying on Amazon to make a living. What Pichai Wanted the Subcommittee to Know About Google, and Him. <url normalizedValue=\"https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Google-G-logo.pngHe\">https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Google-G-logo.pngHe</url> had humble beginnings.Alphabet, Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai, who is from India and was raised in a two-room apartment, told the committee that he had little access to computers growing up. He was amazed by the computer lab at Stanford University, where he earned an M.S. degree. He also received an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. If anyone is looking for a good immigrant story, Pichai's would certainly qualify.Google services make so much possible.He said 140 million students and educators use G Suite for Education to stay connected during the pandemic, and that nearly a third of small business owners say that without Google's digital tools they would have had to close all or portions of their business. He said five million Americans are gaining digital skills through Grow with Google, 'part of our $1 billion initiative to expand economic opportunity,' and millions of small businesses connect with customers through Maps and Search. Mobile operators can build and sell devices without paying Google licensing fees and without having to integrate with Google products; this 'greatly reduces device prices' for billions of consumers around the world.Google is a big employer.Google employs 120,000 people, more than 75,000 of whom are in the U.S.Google invests in America In 2018 the company invested more than $20 billion across the U.S., making it the largest capital investor in the nation that year.and in the world.The company's research and development spend was more than $90 billion over the last five years.Investments are producing.He said Google is helping America 'solidify its position as the global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing.' Google's technology could eventually lead to medical breakthroughs and more efficient batteries.Free services have real value.Google Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos are free and bring 'thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American.'Competition is fierce.Pichai said 'people have more ways to search for information than ever before,' citing the proliferation of apps, the voice searches available by asking Alexa, the Twitter news feeds, the ability to quickly ask a friend via WhatsApp, and recommendations from Snapchat or Pinterest. Searching for products can be done at Amazon, eBay, Walmart or others. Digital advertising competition comes from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast, and others. This has driven down the cost of advertising he said, resulting in 'savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.'They want to cooperate.Pichai said Google is committed to protecting consumers, maintaining America's 'competitive technological edge in the world,' and ensuring that all Americans have access to technology and the opportunity it enables. What the Subcommittee Wanted Everyone to Know About Google. Google dominates search, facilitating 85% of all online queries.Businesses often sink or swim based on whether or where they appear in search results. A number of businesses told the committee that Google steals their content to crush competition. Most businesses stayed anonymous because they feared Google would retaliate against them. One business owner said his website was thriving until Google took his content. His web traffic decreased by 80%. He was forced to downsize and layoff half his employees. Google used to surface the most relevant search results; now they surface the most profitable ads and their own sites.Google searches lead to Google sites. An article from TheMarkup.org said that 63% of web searches on Google take people to Google websites. It also said that 41% of the first page of Google search results is taken up by Google products. <url normalizedValue=\"https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitorsGoogle\">https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitorsGoogle</url> hammers potential competitors.When businesses show a 'proliferating threat' to Google, it puts an end to their traffic. One example came from competition in a vertical market, the restaurant review space where Yelp! was making headway. Google allegedly stole the Yelp! reviews to compete with it. When Yelp asked Google to stop the practice, Google allegedly threatened to delist Yelp! entirely. Google's own documents allegedly revealed that it surveils companies to identify threats.Google abandoned the Pentagon, but assisted Communist China.In October 2018, Google dropped out of the running for a Pentagon contact called Jedi, which was valued at more than $10 billion dollars. The company cited the project's misalignment with its corporate values. Later, Marine General Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff warned the Senate that the Chinese military was benefiting from Google's work. One congressman said Google and China share a comfort with corporate espionage and theft of intellectual property, such as taking certain song lyric images which the creator of the images embedded with a watermark. Google was caught in the act, the representative said.Google pays lip service to privacy. In 2007 Googled purchased Double Click, a leading provider of online advertising tools. Alarm bells were raised about Google's access to the data and how it might connect a users' personal identity to their browsing activity. Google pledged it would not connect the data. In June 2016, Google connected the data and effectively destroyed anonymity on the internet, one legislator said, expressing concern that Google 'surveils' Americans. Because Google is dominant, 'users have no choice but to give up their privacy.' What Cook Wanted the Subcommittee to Know About Apple. <url normalizedValue=\"https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-Logo.pngApple\">https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Apple-Logo.pngApple</url> is proudly American.CEO Tim Cook said Apple's success is 'only possible in this country.' The company endeavors to 'enrich people's lives' and has done so with 'many revolutionary products, not the least of which is the iPhone.'Competition is fierce.'The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Google, have built very successful smartphone businesses Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business.'Privacy is paramount.'We build products that, from the ground up, help users protect their fundamental right to the privacy of their personal data,' Cook said.The App Store is good for everyone.The App Store is a safe and supportive place for developers to create applications for the iPhone, Cook testified. 'For the vast majority of apps on the App Store, developers keep 100% of the money they make. The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device.' The commissions are lower than those required by Apple's competitors.The App Store has been an innovation machine.Starting with only 500 apps, the store now hosts more than 1.7 million apps, 'only 60 of which are Apple software.' If Apple is a gatekeeper, Cook said, 'what we've done is open the gate wider.'The App Store is an 'economic miracle.''More than 1.9 million American jobs in all 50 states are attributable to the App Store ecosystem,' and has facilitated revenues of more than half a trillion dollars globally, $138 billion of which landed in the United States. Competition is good.'I share the Subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue, that it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices,' said Cook.What the Subcommittee Wanted Everyone to Know About Apple. Apple rules. Apple dominates the U.S. smartphone market with more than one million iPhone users. According to Counterpoint Research, that's 39% of the market. Note: Globally, Apple is number three behind Huawei and Samsung.Apple picks the winners.Apple alone decides which apps its users may access. The company makes the rules and changes them along the way, which is why no developer has access to their rules to know how Apple decides which apps they will make available.Apple eliminates competitors at will.Right after Apple released their ScreenTime app, it removed all competing apps for six months. What Zuckerberg Wanted the Subcommittee to Know About Facebook. <url normalizedValue=\"https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Facebook-F-Logo.pngFacebook\">https://moginrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Facebook-F-Logo.pngFacebook</url> is a 'came from nothing success.'CEO Mark Zuckerberg wanted the legislators to know that, while Facebook is successful now, it got there 'the American way,' by 'start[ing] with nothing and provid[ing] better products that people find valuable.'Facebook is good for all.Fueled by advertising sales, Facebook helps 'millions of businesses connect with customers,' giving small companies and entrepreneurs 'access to sophisticated tools that previously only the largest players had.'Competition is fierce.Facebook faces 'significant competition' not only in the U.S. but across the world. In fact, he said, 'China is building its own internet.'Facebook invests in the future.In the face of 'intense competitive pressures' Facebook invests $10 billion a year in research and development.Facebook is all about competition and innovation.Zuckerberg believes that 'strong and consistent competition policy is vital because it ensures that the playing field is level for all.' Antitrust law is designed, in part, to foster innovation, he said, something 'Facebook has been focused on since day one.' He listed the company's advancements in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality, and its contributions to the open-source community.A positive force in the universe. Facebook creates 'technology to enable social good' \u2014 such as allowing family members to check on one another during crises \u2014 and has implemented tools to facilitate charitable giving by users. Zuckerberg said their services have supported individuals and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has connected people to authoritative health information. The company has taken 'aggressive steps' to snuff out dangerous misinformation.Innovation and acquisition.In addition to inventing new services, Facebook has grown through acquisition. 'When you acquire a company, you can benefit from their technology and talent, and when you are acquired you get access to resources and people you otherwise might never have been able to tap into.' Facebook 'made Instagram and WhatsApp successful,' he said.More rules needed.Acknowledging concerns that large tech companies have too much power, he said that companies like his should not be making 'so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy, and election integrity on their own.' Zuckerberg said regulators should play 'a more active role' in these decisions and create 'updated rules for the internet.' In the meantime, he said Facebook is addressing these concerns. What the Subcommittee Wanted Everyone to Know About Facebook. Facebook pummels competitors.Facebook takes an aggressive approach toward competitors to the point where those companies must put themselves up for sale. A March 2012 email cited at the hearing indicated Facebook wants to be even more aggressive toward other companies to get a foothold in different segments and replicate competing services.Facebook buys off the competition.Facebook can buy any company it desires. When they found Instagram a threat, Zuckerberg apparently commented that the smaller company 'can meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business.' Then Facebook bought them.The committee cited an email Zuckerberg allegedly wrote in the wake of the Instagram deal. 'One reason people underestimate the importance of watching Google is that we can likely always just buy any competitive startups, but it'll be a while before we can buy Google.' Zuckerberg couldn't remember the email, but said it sounded to him like he was joking.Acquisitions neutralize competitors and hamper innovators.In February 2012, Zuckerberg told the company's CFO that he wanted to buy Instagram. When he asked if he intended to neutralize a potential competitor or integrate their products, Zuckerberg allegedly answered 'both.' Now if new entrants wish to go up against Instagram, they will struggle because Facebook already has deployed the mechanics of Instagram at enormous scale.Time for a breakup?Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler commented that Zuckerberg's testimony seemed to be making Nadler's point that Instagram should be broken off from Facebook.Edited by Tom Hagy.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.</p><p>Both lawmakers   maligned by President Donald Trump on Twitter as  radical  and  leftist    were criticized for their plan to halt large mergers during the pandemic, among other initiatives.</p><p>The appearance of such a politically charged term in wonkish debate on the future of antitrust is the latest sign competition law is ceding its high ground to partisanship. </p><p>Signs of politicization and finger-pointing are everywhere, fueled by a high-stakes presidential election that could recalibrate merger policy for generations and a coarsening culture that relishes ad hominem attacks. </p><p> If anyone is to blame for the greater partisanship on antitrust, I would blame Donald J. Trump more than anyone else because he s made everything partisan,  a former FTC official told The Deal.</p><p> There s a race to the bottom on so many issues, [and] he has been leading it. </p><p>Democrats also are neck-deep in the mire. </p><p>Warren s much-hyped threat during the Democratic primary to crack down on Big Tech typifies how antitrust can be manipulated for political gain.</p><p>Rather than declare a Warren administration would investigate Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) and split them apart if justified, she went further.</p><p> My administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition   including breaking up  all three companies, she vowed in a March 2019 <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c|manifesto\">https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c|manifesto</url>.</p><p>The proposal drew national media attention and became fodder for a Democratic presidential debate. </p><p>It also left her vulnerable to accusations she d prejudged the outcome, much like Trump was accused of doing when he pledged as a candidate to kill AT&amp;T Inc. s (T) purchase of Time Warner Inc. over his objections to CNN s coverage. </p><p>As left-leaning agitators with bold ambitions to shake up merger policy gain prominence among Democrats, the stage is set for more election-year friction. </p><p>Partisan Rancor</p><p>While there s still bipartisan collaboration in Washington on competition issues, including shared concerns over the market power of Silicon Valley icons, discord is rampant.</p><p>A key metric is party-line votes on marquee transactions and regulatory decisions at the five-member, Republican-controlled FTC.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14878435/index.dl|Rare\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14878435/index.dl|Rare</url> for decades, there have been at least six during the tenure of GOP Chairman Joseph Simons, who took the helm in May 2018.</p><p>In the past, when commissioners in the opposition party objected to a decision, they d often concur in part and dissent in part, the former FTC official observed. Today, the FTC s two Democrats usually dissent in full.</p><p>Not long ago, the tone was conciliatory.</p><p> There really is no such thing as a  Republican  or a  Democratic  antitrust agenda today,  Republican FTC Commissioner Thomas Leary <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/bipartisan-legacy/050803bipartisanlegacy.pdf|declared\">https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/bipartisan-legacy/050803bipartisanlegacy.pdf|declared</url> in a 2005 speech.</p><p> People may have different views on the facts of individual cases for a variety of reasons, but there is a broad mainstream consensus on the basic approach to antitrust issues,  said Leary, who acknowledged past deep divisions. </p><p>During a 2001 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2001/08/antitrust-enforcement-federal-trade-commission-word-continuity|speech\">https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2001/08/antitrust-enforcement-federal-trade-commission-word-continuity|speech</url>, former Republican FTC Chairman Tim Muris declared that  antitrust has become an area of bipartisan cooperation.  </p><p>Such rosy statements seem implausible now. </p><p>Muris described antitrust as guided by consumer protection and economic analysis. Today, he might ve added political calculations, animus and retribution. </p><p>At the FTC, where Democrats Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter are the face of Trump resistance, commissioners talk over each other with chapter-length statements.</p><p>Chopra required 21 pages to express his <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/15033152/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/15033152/index.dl</url> |dissatisfaction with the agency's record-breaking $5 billion privacy fine against Facebook.</p><p>In his 20-page dissent on the clearance of the $63 billion combination of AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and Allergan plc, he decried the FTC s  myopic  stance on pharmaceutical mergers. </p><p>Republicans responded in an 11-page <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20005575/index.dl|missive\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20005575/index.dl|missive</url> that teetered on calling Chopra a liar. They accused him of  disregard for facts,   misleading claims,   false assertions,   misapplication of law,   unbound speculation  and  specious logic. </p><p>During a May <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20005799/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20005799/index.dl</url> |webinar, Republican FTC member Christine Wilson accused Democrats of an ulterior motive for supporting a merger prohibition. </p><p> People on the left who are very unhappy about all mergers as a general rule are using this as an opportunity to push a policy that they couldn t get advanced pre-pandemic,  she claimed.</p><p>She also characterized Democratic tactics as  a great example of not letting a crisis go to waste.  </p><p>Was she parroting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.?</p><p>He used a similar <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487235-mcconnell-house-coronavirus-bill-an-ideological-wish-list\">https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/487235-mcconnell-house-coronavirus-bill-an-ideological-wish-list</url> |phrase to complain about Democratic shenanigans in economic stimulus negotiations, noting that he cribbed the line from longtime Democratic operative Rahm Emanuel.</p><p> The FTC declined comment on dissension within the agency.</p><p>Over at the Republican-controlled DOJ, antitrust division chief Makan Delrahim remains dogged   despite repeated denials   by rumors he challenged AT&amp;T-Time Warner to appease Trump.</p><p>It s not that Delrahim lacks credibility. Even some of his toughest critics grudgingly accept his word. Rather, Trump created the conditions for skeptics and conspiracy theorists to cast doubt. </p><p>In the newly politicized world of antitrust, firing up the political base and capturing headlines have become the endgame. </p><p>Warren and AOC made a splash April 28 when they promised to introduce the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act in their respective chambers. </p><p>Nearly two months later, it s yet to materialize. The Deal <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20006450/index.dl|reported\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20006450/index.dl|reported</url>\u00a0Friday, June 19, that it appears the goal all along was to draw media attention to risks associated with mergers during the health crisis, rather than actually offer legislation.</p><p>Their representatives didn t respond to requests for comment. </p><p>End of Bipartisanship?</p><p>Conventional wisdom in Washington has long been that antitrust, by nature, is bipartisan. </p><p>That s because the adverse effects of consolidation, megamergers and anti-competitive behavior don t distinguish between geographic or political boundaries. </p><p>This notion helped insulate antitrust from the ideological fissures associated with heated issues such as guns or abortion. </p><p> For the last 30 years or so, antitrust enforcement has been largely nonpartisan,  Bill Baer, head of the DOJ antitrust division during the Obama administration, wrote in May 19 House Judiciary <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bill-Baer-5.19.20-Submission-to-Subcommittee-on-Antitrust-Commercial-and-Administrative-Law-of-the-House-Judiciary-Committee.pdf\">https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bill-Baer-5.19.20-Submission-to-Subcommittee-on-Antitrust-Commercial-and-Administrative-Law-of-the-House-Judiciary-Committee.pdf</url>      |comments. </p><p> Analytically sound and fact-based antitrust enforcement  is driven by the goal of protecting consumers and competition, he explained.</p><p> Not political ideology, whim or the desire to pick winners and losers in the economy,  emphasized Baer, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously ran the antitrust practice at Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP.</p><p>Enter Open Markets, an anti-monopoly gadfly with considerable Capitol Hill sway that s seeks seismic change to antitrust law. </p><p>The nonprofit was the first to float a temporary <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004902/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004902/index.dl</url>  |moratorium on transactions and helped spur House Democrats to investigate Big Tech.</p><p>Former legal director Lina Khan, author of a seminal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox</url> |essay on Amazon s rise to dominance, is counsel at the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee leading the inquiry.</p><p>Has the group hijacked the Washington debate with revolutionary ideas or contributed audacious solutions to fix flawed policies?</p><p> Open Markets has shifted the debate in a conservative direction. Conservative means that you conserve what exists,  Barry Lynn, executive director at Open Markets, told The Deal.</p><p>While he agreed that rhetoric on antitrust has become more polarized,  it s not necessarily partisan,  he insisted. </p><p>Regarding the assertion that his group s proposals are too extreme, he flipped the argument, calling Republicans radical for being weak on anti-monopoly enforcement.</p><p>What s radical is the  concentration of power we ve seen in every single sector of the economy in the United States  over the past three decades, he said.</p><p>He views the Chicago School of economics, an approach to antitrust in the 1970s and 1980s that emphasized price consequences as central to merger analysis, as a retreat from tough enforcement. Critics blame it for unleashing industry concentration. </p><p> That is a radical overthrow of the traditional approach to market making,  Lynn said of the framework, promoted by the late Robert Bork in his 1978 book,  The Antitrust Paradox.  The Chicago School s consumer welfare standard remains antitrust s guiding principle today.</p><p>Lynn scoffed at the suggestion merger policy requires gradual shifts.  Was the Sherman Act incremental change?  he asked rhetorically.  Was the Clayton Act an incremental change?  he said, reeling off other landmark antitrust laws.</p><p>As to his conservative critics, he called them \"stooges\" on the payrolls of Big Tech.</p><p>Asked last year about partisanship, Simons pointed to hundreds of <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14907513/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14907513/index.dl</url>  |5-0 votes, many on routine matters, during his chairmanship. </p><p>In a display of his willingness to reach across the aisle, in 2019 he <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14925802/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14925802/index.dl</url>  |endorsed and implemented a Democratic plan for merger retrospectives after initially rejecting it.</p><p>Yet there s no denying tensions are rising. </p><p> The stakes are higher today,  the former FTC official said.  It s not surprising that the rhetoric on antitrust is ratcheted up a little bit. </p><p>He cited increased evidence of concentration and frustration with judicial resistance to merger challenges sought by enforcers as fueling the fire. </p><p>Merriam-Webster defines radical as  very different from the usual or traditional  or  favoring extreme changes. </p><p>That would appear to give the 23 conservatives some cover. </p><p>Former FTC acting chair Maureen Ohlhausen, a signatory, said the intention was to convey to lawmakers that enforcement requires time-tested, incremental, evidence-based improvements rather than abrupt change.</p><p>The parties used radical as a synonym for  dramatic  to describe the upheaval to existing statutes and regulation the Democratic proposals would cause, the Baker Botts LLP antitrust partner told The Deal.</p><p>Noting both sides' penchant for describing opponents as radical, Ohlhausen quipped,  It would be strange indeed for  radical  to be a code for a particular political party that would count Ronald Reagan and all the current advocates for dramatic change as members. </p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 50 Billion and Up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-20006501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607M-X4M1-DY7P-R1X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deal, L.L.C.

The bipartisan consensus that antitrust should focus solely on economic efficiency and consumer welfare has quite suddenly come under attack from prominent voices calling for a dramatically enhanced role for antitrust law in mediating a variety of social, economic, and political friction points, including employment, wealth inequality, data privacy and security, and democratic values. To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum, throwing into confusion a conventional understanding that pro-antitrust sentiment tacks left and antitrust laissez faire tacks right.</p><p>On the left, the assault on the consumer-welfare-oriented status quo has migrated from reformist organizations like the Open Markets Institute and anti-corporate progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, MA) to the House Democratic Leadership, which has staked the 2018 midterm elections on an economic platform including antitrust reform as a centerpiece. In the Democratic Party's center, the formation of a House Antitrust Caucus and reform bills introduced in both the House and Senate underscore increasing political traction to jettison the consumer welfare status quo. The Democrats' antitrust plank in their \"Better Deal\" platform asserts that consumers are but one of several classes that antitrust should protect, with workers, suppliers, and small business taking on equal status. Significantly, the document launches harsh criticisms of the past 30 years of antitrust enforcement as excessively lax--a period over which a Democratic president oversaw antitrust enforcement more than half of the time. The Democratic leadership has made clear that it does not intend to exclude the Clinton and Obama administrations from its criticism and that it intends to advocate a major, trans-partisan rethinking of antitrust policy.</p><p>On the right, President Trump has attacked concentrated economic power in \"Big Media\" and his Justice Department has launched a surprising, aggressive challenge to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner vertical merger. Trump's trustbusting might be dismissed as a feature of his idiosyncratic populism or, less charitably, abusive vendettas against corporate political foes such as CNN and Amazon, but the reformist sentiment on the right is far from limited to the president. Similar sentiments have been expressed by such diverse conservative figures as activist Steve Bannon, who wants to turn Google and Facebook into public utilities, conservative economist Kenneth Rogoff, and Trump's decided political foe Bill Kristol, who criticizes conservative icon Robert Bork's consumer welfare standard and proposes a significant reinvigoration of the antitrust laws to limit the growing power of tech's \"Big Five\" (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft). The American Conservative magazine recently turned on Bork with surprising ferocity, asserting that \"whereas prior generations of lawmakers protected the American citizenry as businessmen, entrepreneurs, and growers, Bork led a revolution that sacrificed the small producer at the altar of efficiency and cheap goods.\"</p><p>Standing against the anti-incumbent challengers from both political wings is a broad, bipartisan establishment center seeking to defend the consumer welfare framework. Until recently, this establishment center seemed far from unified. Since the rise of the Chicago School view of antitrust in the 1970s, antitrust law has been contested on terms that seemed generally to track left/right political ideology, with those on the left favoring more aggressive intervention and those on the right more laissez faire. But the rising tide of calls for a radically different version of antitrust has led to a circling of establishment wagons around the consumer welfare standard. Left-leaning organizations that once led the charge for more aggressive enforcement now find themselves defending the consumer welfare idea in principle, even while calling for more aggressive enforcement within that paradigm. Meanwhile, conventionally conservative or pro-business organizations continue to defend the consumer welfare standard against assaults from their own right flank.</p><p>Although unconventional in present terms, the emerging political dislocations over antitrust policy reflect longstanding ideological ambiguities about and within the anti-monopoly tradition. In particular, the current political fracturing over antitrust is best understood by examining three ideological friction points that have emerged periodically within American history:</p><p>* the ideological ambiguity surrounding the association between large scale in business and government</p><p>* the shifting meaning of \"monopoly\" from exclusive grant of government privilege to purely private power and a related question about the sources of monopoly power</p><p>* pragmatic concerns about the ability of the capitalist order to survive without regulatory interventions to smooth its roughest edges</p><p>Taken in the context of these longstanding friction points, the strange bedfellow coalitions uneasily rising around contemporary antitrust reform aren't that strange at all.</p><p>BRANDEIS AND BORK AS IDEOLOGICAL TOUCHPOINTS</p><p>Although American antitrust policy has been influenced by a wide variety of ideological schools, two influences stand out as historically most significant to understanding the contemporary antitrust debate.</p><p>The first is a Brandeisian school, epitomized in the title of Louis Brandeis's 1914 essay in Harper's Weekly, \"The Curse of Bigness.\" Arguing for \"regulated competition\" over \"regulated monopoly,\" he asserted that it was necessary to \"curb[] physically the strong, to protect those physically weaker\" in order to sustain industrial liberty. He evoked a Jeffersonian vision of a social-economic order organized on a small scale, with atomistic competition between a large number of equally advantaged units. His goals included the economic, social, and political. As explained in a dissenting opinion by William O. Douglas in the 1948 Columbia Steel case, Brandeis worried that</p><p>size can become a menace--both industrial and social. It can be an industrial menace because it creates gross inequalities against existing or putative competitors. It can be a social menace--because of its control of prices.</p><p>The Brandeisian vision held sway in U.S. antitrust from the Progressive Era through the early 1970s, albeit with significant interruptions. Its spirit animates a long chain of important cases from Chicago Board of Trade in 1918 (authored by Brandeis himself) to TOPCO in 1972, and a string of congressional reforms including the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts of 1914, the Robinson-Patman Act of 1938, and the Celler-Kefauver Act of1950.</p><p>The ascendant Chicago School of the 1960s and 1970s threw down the gauntlet to the Brandeisian tendency of U.S. antitrust law. In an early mission statement, Bork and Ward Bowman characterized antitrust history as \"vacillat[ing] between the policy of preserving competition and the policy of preserving competitors from their more energetic and efficient rivals,\" the latter being an interpretation of the Brandeis School. Chicagoans argued that antitrust law should be concerned solely with economic efficiency and consumer welfare. \"Bigness\" was no longer necessarily a curse, but often the product of superior efficiency. Chicago criticized Brandeis's \"sympathy for small, perhaps inefficient, traders who might go under in fully competitive markets.\" Preserving a level playing field meant stifling efficiency to enable market participation by the mediocre.</p><p>Beginning in 1977-1978, the Chicago School achieved an almost complete triumph in the Supreme Court, at least in the limited sense that the Court came to adopt the economic efficiency/consumer welfare model as the exclusive or near exclusive goal of antitrust law. (Adoption of Chicago School interpretations of consumer welfare and policy positions on particular competitive practices would occur neither immediately nor completely.) In 1979, citing Bork, the Court declared that \"Congress designed the Sherman Act as a 'consumer welfare prescription.'\" Over time, the maxim that antitrust law should protect \"competition rather than competitors\" became canonical. Brandeis had been displaced by Bork.</p><p>If the last three or four decades of U.S. antitrust policy have largely belonged to Bork--at least at an ideological level--the Bork vs. Brandeis dichotomy is far from settled. The voices at the cutting edge of the rising reformist movement--particularly those aligned with the influential Open Markets Institute--explicitly style themselves as a \"New Brandeis\" school in order to re-up the historical contest between the Brandeisian and Chicago School orders.</p><p>THE LINGERING SHADOWS OF JEFFERSONIANISM AND HAMILTONIANISM</p><p>Although it is conventional to understand Brandeis's anti-bigness ideology as an aspect of Progressivism standing in contrast to Chicago's big business conservatism, the story is historically more nuanced. Brandeis's preoccupation with \"bigness\" was not limited to large corporate scale; he was also deeply concerned with large governmental scale generally, and a large-scale federal government in particular. As George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen observed in a June 2016 article in The Atlantic, \"Denouncing big banks as well as big government as symptoms of what he called a 'curse of bigness,' Brandeis was determined to diminish concentrated financial and federal power, which he viewed as a menace to liberty and democracy.\" Brandeis styled himself a Jeffersonian and his ideology resonated with the Jeffersonian preference for small-scale yeomanry and localized political organization.</p><p>In lionizing large corporate scale, the Chicago School aligned itself with the Hamiltonian vision for a robustly mercantile society grounded on powerful financial and economic institutions. By doing so, Chicago always risked alienating the libertarian right, with its affinity for Jefferson's vision of small-scale government and industrial production. Many libertarians have found it hard to attack bloated government without also worrying about bloated business. (Witness the rise of the Tea Party, which arose in large part as a reaction to corporate bailouts.) Influential libertarians like Friedrich Hayek saw a role for antitrust law in curbing monopolistic abuses because they understood unfettered corporate power as a threat to personal liberty.</p><p>The divide between the competing Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian ideals on organizational scale and their implications for efficiency and liberty thread through antitrust's intellectual and ideological history, often disrupting conventional political alignments. Teddy Roosevelt, a deep admirer of Hamilton, was comfortable with large scale in both government and business. Far from a \"trustbuster,\" Roosevelt opposed breaking up Standard Oil, viewing large aggregations of capital as inevitable and necessary--so long as they were superintended by a strong federal government. Roosevelt's affinity for large-scale government and business earned him the epithet of \"socialist.\"</p><p>That charge was hyperbolic, but not directionally implausible. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American socialists looked with suspicion on the antitrust laws because they viewed the rise of the Gilded Age trusts as salutary stepping stones to government appropriation of the means of production and industry. Socialist presidential candidate Eugene Debs, himself the defendant in an antitrust prosecution, argued:</p><p>Monopoly is certain and sure. It is merely a question of whether they will be collectively owned monopolies, for the good of the race, or whether they will be privately owned for the power, pleasure and glory of the Morgans, Rockefellers, Guggenheims, and Carnegies.</p><p>Conversely, influential conservatives in antitrust's formative era favored aggressive antitrust enforcement as an antidote to the simultaneous aggrandizement of government and business. In the crucible election of 1912, William Howard Taft argued against Progressive proposals to create a new Federal Trade Commission, asserting that his administration's aggressive enforcement record demonstrated how traditional prosecutorial and common law processes could obviate the need to create new large-governmental organizations to combat big business. Taft's pro-enforcement saber-rattling reached such a crescendo that Wall Street began to wonder whether Roosevelt might be the candidate more sympathetic to their interests.</p><p>The New Deal, too, saw the Democratic Party equivocate between contending Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian impulses on the question of governmental and business scale. The first New Deal period, from 1933 to early 1935, was dominated by the National Industrial Recovery Act, which encouraged a centralization of both governmental and industrial power. Brandeis led the charge on the Supreme Court to strike down the NIRA in 1935, warning the White House that the Court would not tolerate continued centralization of business or governmental power. From 1935 until the beginning of the war, the New Deal administration followed a policy of aggressively Brandeisian antitrust enforcement. Then, facing a need to mobilize big business for the war effort, the administration abruptly shifted course and embraced a \"business commonwealth\" model of partnership between big government and big business.</p><p>After the war, the perception that industrial concentration in Germany and Japan had fueled the rise of fascism contributed to a two-decade period of intensive antitrust enforcement--particularly against mergers--launched by the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950. Here again, the ideology of the anti-monopoly movement was ambiguous in conventional left/right terms. The anti-monopolist Sen. Estes Kefauver (D, TN) warned that the consequence of further industrial concentration would be government takeover, and that could lead either to fascism on the one hand or socialism or communism on the other. Other proponents of the act argued that the antitrust laws were \"one of the greatest bulwarks against communism\" and that the rising tide of industrial concentration was driving the country toward \"collectivism.\" It is no coincidence that the most anti-consolidationist statute in American history was passed during the period of the Red Scare.</p><p>The ambiguity in the relationship between corporate scale and governmental scale has translated into a historical ambiguity in the politics of antitrust enforcement. Just as the two major contemporary political parties each blend contradictory Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian elements, so too antitrust ideology has not neatly tracked left/right dichotomies. On a statistical basis, civil antitrust enforcement by the government peaked during the conservative Nixon and Ford administrations. The Chicago School rode the wave of Ronald Reagan's decoupling of the curse of bigness; bigness was a curse in the government only, not in business. But Chicago's decoupling of the ideological aversion to large scale in government and business is not inevitable and may be, in historical perspective, anomalous. As historian Richard Hofstadter has written, American feelings about large organizational units in government and business have generally tracked in parallel. Historically, it is no anomaly that small-government conservatives would find common ground with Brandeisian progressives in resenting the growth and power of large-scale industrial firms, which are not so easily distinguished from large-scale governmental agencies.</p><p>THE SHIFTING MEANING OF \"MONOPOLY\"</p><p>The ideological valence of the anti-monopoly principle is ambiguous in contemporary left/right terms, owing in large part to a historical shift in the meaning of the word \"monopoly,\" particularly in its popular and pejorative senses. Is a monopolist a private firm that corners a market through nefarious or shrewd tactics? If so, the law's anti-monopoly response codes \"regulatory\" and \"interventionist\" in left/right terms. Or is a \"monopoly\" a cronyist intervention by the state to prevent free market competition? In that case, the anti-monopoly principle codes as \"deregulatory\" and \"free market.\" Both of these senses of \"monopoly\" have been used historically, and their contemporary manifestations remain tangled.</p><p>Throughout much of the Anglo-American anti-monopoly tradition, \"monopoly\" primarily denoted a governmental grant of an exclusive privilege--a \"letters patent\" in the sense of the classic common law case. Until the late 19th century, the American antimonopoly tradition was concerned primarily with governmental cronyism and exclusive privilege. Over time, however, the primary legal meaning of \"monopoly\" has shifted from the government-granted to the purely private.</p><p>This shift became apparent in U.S. antitrust law in 1943 when, in Parker v. Brown, the U.S. Supreme Court held the Sherman Act inapplicable to anticompetitive structures created by state regulation. Parker grew out of the Supreme Court's post-1937 constitutional jurisprudence rejecting Lochner-era judicial scrutiny of regulatory schemes impairing property or contract rights. Just as the post-1937 constitutional dispensation would avoid second-guessing state regulatory judgments in favor of judicially preferred economic theories, so too the courts would reject efforts to use the Sherman Act to the same effect (to the dismay of conservatives, who favored the judiciary as a bulwark against over-regulation).</p><p>From one perspective, Parker stood the meaning of \"monopoly\" on its head. Whereas the primary meaning of \"monopoly\" in the Anglo-American tradition had been a governmental grant of exclusive privilege--an interference with the natural rights of other market participants--that primary sense of \"monopoly\" was now to be excluded altogether from the Sherman Act's anti-monopoly legal regime. Only purely private monopolies--the second sense of the word discussed above--would be covered by antitrust.</p><p>The Parker doctrine of state action immunity from antitrust has not developed to immunize state regulation from Sherman Act preemption as strongly as Parker's language would suggest, and the doctrine's evolution continues. In the push and pull over the doctrine's boundaries, it has largely been advocates of the Chicago School's consumer welfare approach who have argued for narrowing state-action immunity on the view that states systematically distort competitive processes for the benefit of rent-seekers. This simultaneously pro-antitrust and deregulatory perspective tracks that strand of the anti-monopoly tradition accusing the government as culprit.</p><p>ARE PRIVATE MONOPOLIES THE PRODUCT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION?</p><p>This ambiguity over the meaning of \"monopoly\" and its attendant legal and policy implications cashes out also in legal and economic discourse over the sources of monopoly power. A neo-classical economic view, today associated with Chicago School ideology, holds that markets are contestable and that any monopoly power gained through anticompetitive means is quickly eroded, but with one important exception: governmentally created entry barriers.</p><p>If regulation and governmental favoritism are the only important sources of durable monopoly power, then one potential policy response is not to worry about privately acquired monopoly--essentially, to turn the Parker state action immunity regime on its head and only police state-granted monopolies. But there is another possibility flowing from the opening premise, which is to hold that any observed instances of genuinely durable monopoly power must be the result of some seen or unseen governmental distortion. In this latter view, when what at first blush may seem to be purely private monopoly power persists over time, there must be some underlying governmental distortion accounting for it. Then, this argument goes, even committed libertarians should favor antitrust intervention to terminate the monopoly.</p><p>This view is not hypothetical; it explains some of the right's historical affinity for antitrust enforcement despite the right's otherwise laissez faire predilections. The clearest case in point is the 1983 consent decree breaking up AT&amp;T. How did the largest anti-monopoly corporate breakup in history occur at the hands of the Reagan administration and its decidedly Chicago School Justice Department? The answer lies in Assistant Attorney General Bill Baxter's conviction that AT&amp;T was exploiting its status as a regulated monopolist to stifle competition. What has come to be known as \"Baxter's law\" posits that rate-regulated monopolists may extract monopoly profits from vertically integrated markets without running afoul of the \"one monopoly profit\" theorem. Suspecting government regulation as the deep source of AT&amp;T's persistent monopolistic behavior, the conservative Reagan administration was willing to break it up.</p><p>Similar suspicions that \"Big Tech\" companies like Google and Facebook are the monopolistic beneficiaries of subtle governmental cronyism show up today on the political right. That Big Tech tends to be associated politically with the Democratic Party only furthers these perceptions. Those inherently suspicious of governmental interventions in markets may understand Big Tech as the unnatural spawn of governmentally granted privilege and private greed. Conversely, those more sympathetic to governmental intervention may find nothing alarming about the multiple ways in which Big Tech appropriates governmental benefits through such vehicles as intellectual property law, government subsidies, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. But these matters divide the left as well. The Open Markets Institute was forced out of the progressive-leaning New America Foundation over Open Markets' criticisms of Google. In light of the contestable boundaries of the public/private divide and the shifting meaning of monopoly, it is not surprising to see political alliances fraying over antitrust reform.</p><p>PRAGMATIC CONCERNS OVER ANTITRUST'S ALTERNATIVES AND CAPITALISM'S SURVIVAL</p><p>A final reason that the politics of antitrust sometimes confound the conventional left/right divide has to do with the pragmatic sense that some regulatory interventions may be necessary to preserve capitalism politically, and that antitrust may be the least objectionable one. This \"antitrust or else\" perspective has characterized the politics of antitrust from the beginning.</p><p>The conventional view that Congress intended the Sherman Act to seriously undermine the trusts is balderdash. The 51st Congress that passed the Sherman Act was dominated by industrial magnates who wanted to avert more radical reforms. Speaking on the Senate floor in 1890, Sen. John Sherman (R, OH) warned his brethren--many of whom were controlled by the trusts--that Congress \"must heed [the public's] appeal or be ready for the socialist, the communist, and the nihilist.\" Sherman thus conceived of his eponymous antitrust statute as politically necessary to diffuse more radical political movements--as a sort of Band-Aid on capitalism.</p><p>The idea that antitrust legislation and enforcement are necessary accommodations to public demand has a long pedigree in both conservative and more progressive circles. Writing in 1914, William Howard Taft described the Sherman Act as \"a step taken by Congress to meet what the public had found to be a growing and intolerable evil.\" Notably, he did not share the public's concern nor attribute such a concern to Congress. Similarly, Theodore Roosevelt was relatively unconcerned with the trusts personally, but \"saw the trust problem as something that must be dealt with on the political level; public concern about it was too urgent to be ignored.\"</p><p>Beyond the concern that, absent antitrust, capitalism itself might succumb to reformist pressures, there is a more modest possibility that, absent antitrust, political pressures would lead to overregulation. Antitrust and administrative regulation are conventionally viewed as alternatives to address market failures. From the Reagan administration to the Financial Crisis of 2008, the overall arc of American law involved simultaneous deregulation and relaxation of antitrust enforcement. If popular dissatisfaction with the economic status quo grows, demand might grow to pull either the regulatory or antitrust lever. Those ideologically committed to a light governmental hand on the market might prefer the antitrust alternative.</p><p>It is hard to judge at any given moment how much political support for antitrust intervention is motivated by genuine concern over monopoly and competition, and how much of it derives from the fact that, in the face of popular demand for a governmental cure to a perceived evil, it is often easier to delegate the solution to antitrust than to propose a regulatory solution. From the Sherman Act forward, however, it is certain that antitrust has often been deployed as a foil to more interventionist forms of regulation. The ideological and political implications of that move are complex and not neatly housed in left/right categories.</p><p>DANIEL A.

Neppl[1] Foley ...rdner LLP[2] Legal News Alert[3] In his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump frequently expressed populist themes, rhetorically criticizing 'big business' and 'special interests,' and signaled an activist antitrust agenda withhis comment in October 2016[4]that a major telecom deal (Time Warner/AT...would not be allowed: \"AT...s buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" We are now almost three years into the Trump Administration, and we have seen some surprising DOJ (Antitrust Division) enforcement priorities, efforts and outcomes. Below, we highlight some of those surprises and discuss possible consequences. DOJ Antitrust Surprises Makan Delrahim, President Trump's nominee for the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust post at DOJ, was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017. DOJ antitrust enforcement under Delrahim has been quite eventful. </p><p>1. DOJ Challenges Time Warner/AT#38;T The first major merger review for Delrahim to consider as AAG was Time Warner/AT...DOJ sued to block thisverticaldeal in November 2017, at least in part because of Delrahim's view that behavioral relief, of the type historically accepted by DOJ (and FTC) to address vertical merger concerns, should be highly disfavored. Following a bench trial on the antitrust merits, Judge Richard Leon denied DOJ's injunction request. The D.C. Circuit affirmed Judge Leon's decision in February 2019.This litigation outcome is relevant to the ongoing discussion of whether DOJ and FTC should issue 'new' vertical merger guidelines, or 'update' what are essentially null guidelines issued in 1984 and, if so, what such guidelines should reflect. Both FTC and DOJ are reportedly working on new vertical guidelines. These efforts may be challenging given thatmostvertical mergers are viewed by regulators and economists as generally beneficial to competition or at least competitively neutral. This litigation outcome also raises questions regarding the scope of DOJ's willingness to consider behavioral relief in future transactions. 2. DOJ's Position on Licensing Standard Essential Patents DOJ has publicly criticized its sister antitrust enforcement agency \u2014 the FTC \u2014 in FTC's successful District Court challenge of Qualcomm's licensing practices relating to standard essential patents addressing 4G transmission technologies. Such a public disagreement between FTC and DOJ on an antitrust policy question is very unusual. Qualcomm has appealed the May 2019 decision of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to the Ninth Circuit, and DOJ filed a 'Statement of Interest' in July 2019 with the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the District Court decision 'threatens competition, innovation, and national security.'This Ninth Circuit appeal raises an important policy question regarding theantitrusttreatment of certain IP licensing practices. The DOJ's public rebuke of FTC's enforcement efforts in this case, however, is a significant surprise, and raises the possibility of public disagreements between the agencies on other antitrust policy questions. 3. DOJ's Burden in Tunney Act Reviews DOJ approved the acquisition of Aetna by CVS in October 2018, subject to the divestiture of Aetna's Medicare Part D prescription drug plan business. The parties closed the transaction in November 2018. The required Tunney Act approval of DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement reflecting the divestiture obligation, however, proved surprisingly difficult. While that Tunney Act approval finally issued in September 2019 (by the same Judge Richard Leon who tried DOJ's challenge of Time Warner/AT... DOJ challenged Judge Leon's authority under the Tunney Act to consider competitive effects of the transaction not addressed by DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement.Judge Leon's approval order made clear that, in Judge Leon's view, a District Court's review authority under the Tunney Act is not limited to the competition issues identified and challenged by DOJ. Judge Leon also criticized DOJ's Tunney Act compliance efforts, noting that DOJ's response to public comments was 'rife with conclusory allegations.'This outcome may increase the probability of contentious Tunney Act reviews in the future, which could affect timing risk and the contractual allocation of antitrust risk in future transactions. 4. DOJ's Settlement in Sprint/T-Mobile Conflicts with State AG Challenge DOJ (and various state AGs) reached a settlement in Sprint/T-Mobile in July 2019, with the Tunney Act review of DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement pending before D.C. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai previously announced his support for the combination (subject to conditions) in May 2019. Nevertheless, other State AGs (led by NY and CA) are challenging the transaction in the Southern District of New York. A trial of the State AG matter is scheduled to begin on December 9, 2019.Antitrust opposition by State AGs - at least in the form of an independent legal challenge in court - to a merger approved at the federal level by DOJ or FTC is unusual. This State AG challenge raises at least thepossibilityof one federal court approving a DOJ Proposed Final Judgement as consistent with the 'public interest' standard under the Tunney Act, while another federal court enjoins the transaction (perhaps on antitrust grounds not even asserted by DOJ). At the very least, the parallel State AG challenge here may increase the probability in future transactions that one or more State AGs - not satisfied with a DOJ or FTC settlement agreement - will seek independently to enjoin the transaction, thus exposing transactions to greater timing and deal risk. Merger reviews in the EU, in contrast, are conducted either by the EC (DG Comp), or at the EU member-state level, but not both simultaneously. 5. DOJ's Willingness to Arbitrate Market Definition In September 2019, DOJ sued to block the proposed acquisition of Aleris Corp. by Novelis Inc., two producers of aluminum for automobile manufacturing. Surprisingly, for the first time, DOJ agreed with the parties to use binding arbitration to define the product market. Whether DOJ (or FTC) will arbitrate this key antitrust issue in other merger challenges is unknown although, as AAG Delrahim has noted, arbitration could well allow (at least some) merger challenges to be resolved more 'efficiently and effectively.' 6. DOJ Second Requests in Cannabis-Related Transactions For reasons unclear, DOJ has issued numerous Second Requests in cannabis-related transactions, including transactions that would appear antitrust non-problematic (applying any traditional market definition and market concentration measures). DOJ reportedly seeks to understand better this industry, which is now legal (to one degree or another) in many states, if not yet at the federal level.DOJ's use of its Second Request authority to investigate antitrust non-problematic transactions for the purpose of 'studying' a nascent industry is both surprising and perhaps troubling. 7. DOJ Investigations of Big Tech DOJ and FTC have reportedly 'allocated' their federal investigations of Big Tech (with Facebook and Amazon assigned to FTC, and Apple and GOOGLE assigned to DOJ). This is no surprise, as FTC and DOJ have historically allocated various industries between themselves, based primarily on 'industry expertise.' But theoutcomesof these investigations could yield some very interesting surprises, given the multiplicity of possible conduct questions potentially subject to investigation, the potential for FTC and DOJ disagreement over the legality of similar conduct, and the further possibility of conflicting outcomes from independent State AG investigations (as we now see possible in the treatment of the Sprint/T-Mobile US transaction). 2019 Foley ...rdner LLP [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/gregory-e-neppl\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/gregory-e-neppl</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/foley-lardner-llp\">https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/foley-lardner-llp</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.foley.com/en/insights\">http://www.foley.com/en/insights</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-would-block-at-t-time-warner-deal-1477162214\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-would-block-at-t-time-warner-deal-1477162214</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NTLR1207091570740353110251761300165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTLR-120709</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-49R1-F03R-N18D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>National Law Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Below, we highlight some of those surprises and discuss possible consequences. DOJ Antitrust Surprises Makan Delrahim, President Trump's nominee for the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust post at DOJ, was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017. DOJ antitrust enforcement under Delrahim has been quite eventful. </p><p>1. DOJ Challenges Time Warner/AT#38;T The first major merger review for Delrahim to consider as AAG was Time Warner/AT...DOJ sued to block this vertical deal in November 2017, at least in part because of Delrahim's view that behavioral relief, of the type historically accepted by DOJ (and FTC) to address vertical merger concerns, should be highly disfavored. Following a bench trial on the antitrust merits, Judge Richard Leon denied DOJ's injunction request. The D.C. Circuit affirmed Judge Leon's decision in February 2019.This litigation outcome is relevant to the ongoing discussion of whether DOJ and FTC should issue 'new' vertical merger guidelines, or 'update' what are essentially null guidelines issued in 1984 and, if so, what such guidelines should reflect. Both FTC and DOJ are reportedly working on new vertical guidelines. These efforts may be challenging given that most vertical mergers are viewed by regulators and economists as generally beneficial to competition or at least competitively neutral. This litigation outcome also raises questions regarding the scope of DOJ's willingness to consider behavioral relief in future transactions. 2. DOJ's Position on Licensing Standard Essential Patents DOJ has publicly criticized its sister antitrust enforcement agency \u2014 the FTC \u2014 in FTC's successful District Court challenge of Qualcomm's licensing practices relating to standard essential patents addressing 4G transmission technologies. Such a public disagreement between FTC and DOJ on an antitrust policy question is very unusual. Qualcomm has appealed the May 2019 decision of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to the Ninth Circuit, and DOJ filed a 'Statement of Interest' in July 2019 with the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the District Court decision 'threatens competition, innovation, and national security.'This Ninth Circuit appeal raises an important policy question regarding the antitrust treatment of certain IP licensing practices. The DOJ's public rebuke of FTC's enforcement efforts in this case, however, is a significant surprise, and raises the possibility of public disagreements between the agencies on other antitrust policy questions. 3. DOJ's Burden in Tunney Act Reviews DOJ approved the acquisition of Aetna by CVS in October 2018, subject to the divestiture of Aetna's Medicare Part D prescription drug plan business. The parties closed the transaction in November 2018. The required Tunney Act approval of DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement reflecting the divestiture obligation, however, proved surprisingly difficult. While that Tunney Act approval finally issued in September 2019 (by the same Judge Richard Leon who tried DOJ's challenge of Time Warner/AT... DOJ challenged Judge Leon's authority under the Tunney Act to consider competitive effects of the transaction not addressed by DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement.Judge Leon's approval order made clear that, in Judge Leon's view, a District Court's review authority under the Tunney Act is not limited to the competition issues identified and challenged by DOJ. Judge Leon also criticized DOJ's Tunney Act compliance efforts, noting that DOJ's response to public comments was 'rife with conclusory allegations.'This outcome may increase the probability of contentious Tunney Act reviews in the future, which could affect timing risk and the contractual allocation of antitrust risk in future transactions. 4. DOJ's Settlement in Sprint/T-Mobile Conflicts with State AG Challenge DOJ (and various state AGs) reached a settlement in Sprint/T-Mobile in July 2019, with the Tunney Act review of DOJ's Proposed Final Judgement pending before D.C. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai previously announced his support for the combination (subject to conditions) in May 2019. Nevertheless, other State AGs (led by NY and CA) are challenging the transaction in the Southern District of New York. A trial of the State AG matter is scheduled to begin on December 9, 2019.Antitrust opposition by State AGs - at least in the form of an independent legal challenge in court - to a merger approved at the federal level by DOJ or FTC is unusual. This State AG challenge raises at least the possibility of one federal court approving a DOJ Proposed Final Judgement as consistent with the 'public interest' standard under the Tunney Act, while another federal court enjoins the transaction (perhaps on antitrust grounds not even asserted by DOJ). At the very least, the parallel State AG challenge here may increase the probability in future transactions that one or more State AGs - not satisfied with a DOJ or FTC settlement agreement - will seek independently to enjoin the transaction, thus exposing transactions to greater timing and deal risk. Merger reviews in the EU, in contrast, are conducted either by the EC (DG Comp), or at the EU member-state level, but not both simultaneously. 5. DOJ's Willingness to Arbitrate Market Definition In September 2019, DOJ sued to block the proposed acquisition of Aleris Corp. by Novelis Inc., two producers of aluminum for automobile manufacturing. Surprisingly, for the first time, DOJ agreed with the parties to use binding arbitration to define the product market. Whether DOJ (or FTC) will arbitrate this key antitrust issue in other merger challenges is unknown although, as AAG Delrahim has noted, arbitration could well allow (at least some) merger challenges to be resolved more 'efficiently and effectively.' 6. DOJ Second Requests in Cannabis-Related Transactions For reasons unclear, DOJ has issued numerous Second Requests in cannabis-related transactions, including transactions that would appear antitrust non-problematic (applying any traditional market definition and market concentration measures). DOJ reportedly seeks to understand better this industry, which is now legal (to one degree or another) in many states, if not yet at the federal level.DOJ's use of its Second Request authority to investigate antitrust non-problematic transactions for the purpose of 'studying' a nascent industry is both surprising and perhaps troubling. 7. DOJ Investigations of Big Tech DOJ and FTC have reportedly 'allocated' their federal investigations of Big Tech (with Facebook and Amazon assigned to FTC, and Apple and GOOGLE assigned to DOJ). This is no surprise, as FTC and DOJ have historically allocated various industries between themselves, based primarily on 'industry expertise.' But the outcomes of these investigations could yield some very interesting surprises, given the multiplicity of possible conduct questions potentially subject to investigation, the potential for FTC and DOJ disagreement over the legality of similar conduct, and the further possibility of conflicting outcomes from independent State AG investigations (as we now see possible in the treatment of the Sprint/T-Mobile US transaction).

(Dow Jones) -- Big tech companies were almost used to waste time when facing antitrust cases in the European Union. A tactic that might not work for them any longer.<br/><br/>Margrethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, is dusting off an inactive regulatory tool, called \"provisional measures,\" which could force dominant companies to moderate their highly suspicious anti-competitive practices before officials have proven their case. Your research on semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom is a test case.</p><p><br/><br/>Officials have not used such provisional measures since 2001, when the European court established a very high threshold for their use. There must be very obvious abuse involving a real risk of serious and irreparable harm to rival companies.<br/><br/>Vestager, which promised stronger action in digital markets at its confirmation audience on Tuesday, October 8, is focusing on the incentives Broadcom pays major set-top box manufacturers to exclusively use its microcircuits.<br/><br/>As the world's largest manufacturer of integrated microcircuits for cable communication devices, the company has special responsibilities under European Union law not to abuse its dominant market power.<br/><br/>He is currently finalizing his decision, waiting for an announcement in the coming weeks. If the European Union rules against Broadcom, the company will have to stop paying those incentives that the antitrust commission suspects are illegal, a decision it will likely appeal in European courts.<br/><br/>The reactivation of provisional measures is based on the logic that today's fast-moving markets can tilt very quickly in favour of the dominant undertaking.<br/><br/>Since antitrust investigations take two to seven years to complete, the decision to ban an abusive practice may come too late to protect competitors. While the tool could be used in any industry, the technology sector is an important focus.<br/><br/>An extreme example is this summer's decision that microcircuit manufacturer Qualcomm used predatory pricing to remove its rival Icera from the market.<br/><br/>Once touted as a potential unicorn, a newly created company valued at more than $1 billion, the UK-based company drastically narrowed its ambitions shortly after filing an official complaint with the European Union in 2010. The company was sold to Nvidia for $367 million the following year and the lawsuit filed in 2015. Qualcomm has appealed the European Union's decision.<br/><br/>The European Union's decision to fine-tune its tools comes amid the recent backlash against technology companies in the United States, which has seen state and national agencies initiate investigations and increase talks on a stricter enforcement.<br/><br/>Brussels is a leader in antitrust thinking, raising the spectre that other competition agencies around the world, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, can emulate their strategy.<br/><br/>If they face interim measures in Europe, America's technology companies will have to rethink their strategy. There will be more incentives to cooperate with officials to clear their name and quickly remove restrictions. Currently, delaying an investigation can only help them extend the benefit of any behavior that may end up being declared illegal at the end of the day.<br/><br/>On the positive side, companies will have an early opportunity to present their case to a judge, as they can appeal provisional measures at the beginning of the investigation rather than having to wait until after the European Union makes its final decision.<br/><br/>For powerful companies, antitrust investigations today represent a cost of doing business. These could soon change the way they do business.<br/><br/>Silicon Valley would do well not to underestimate that small but significant difference.<br/><br/><br/>Translated by Luis Felipe Cedillo<br/><br/>Edited by Michelle del Campo<br/><br/>Copyright \u00a9 2019 Dow Jones &amp;Company;, Inc.

Your name:   Your email:   Send to email:   THIS POST HAS BEEN SHARED! On Wednesday, July 29th, the US House of Representative\u2019s antitrust subcommittee summoned the CEOs of four tech giants \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google \u2013 to testify at a historic hearing to determine whether the companies had abused their vast market power by misusing data and stifling competition to dominate the market. Since June, the subcommittee had been gathering testimonies from smaller competitors about the alleged monopolistic practices of big tech, and July 29th marked the first time the CEOs were summoned together for a congressional hearing.   At the hearing, a 15-member panel of democratic and republican lawmakers presented evidence and posed nuanced questions spanning Amazon\u2019s use of seller data to develop competing products, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in an apparent bid to retain market dominance, Google\u2019s alleged theft of content from smaller businesses, Apple\u2019s preferential treatment of some developers on its AppStore, and even the companies\u2019 \u201cliberal bias\u201d that saw conservative voices reportedly being stifled on online platforms. While all CEOs invariably denied accusations of engaging in anti-competitive practices, the hearing was significant as it threw light on the subcommittee\u2019s year-long investigation into big tech. It also showed that formal antitrust cases may be imminent against some companies and that lawmakers are actively contemplating new regulations in this space. The subcommittee is expected to publish its report in the coming months.   Similar antitrust investigations against big tech are increasingly being seen in other parts of the world as well. The European Union has already fined Google on three separate occasions since 2017, the most recent being March 2019, when it imposed a \u20ac1.5 billion fine for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. In July 2019, the European Commissioner for Competition launched a formal investigation into Amazon\u2019s use of sensitive seller data in breach of EU competition rules. The Competition Commission of India, in January 2020, had also begun looking into the anti-competitive practices of Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, while South Korea\u2019s Fair Trade Commission is preparing a similar investigation against Google and Korean search engine Naver.   In a separate development in the US, President Donald Trump on Thursday, August 7th, issued executive orders that would see social media apps TikTok and WeChat being banned in the country if they are not sold by their Chinese parent companies to a US company within 45 days. The orders describe these apps as security concerns as they are prone/open to data requests by the Chinese government, which could threaten the US\u2019 national security, foreign policy and economy. President Trump\u2019s orders largely follow India\u2019s example in banning 59 Chinese apps in June (including TikTok and WeChat), followed by another 47 apps in July, citing concerns that these apps had been stealing and surreptitiously transmitting user data to servers located outside India. Microsoft is already in talks to purchase TikTok, though Chinese authorities have also expressed outrage over the \u201ckidnapping\u201d of Chinese apps.   5 reasons why Microsoft\u2019s potential TikTok acquisition is a bad idea   The 20th century dictum: never waste a good crisis.   The 21st century correction: if it\u2019s China tech, let the crisis-opportunity pass.   As Microsoft\u2014 the world\u2019s third most-valuable company after Saudi Aramco and Apple\u2014gets ready to buy the US, Australia and New Zealand assets of TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, it might be living in paradigms of the past, where you identify a rising sector you\u2019re not present in, focus on a good brand, undertake a due diligence, buy and ride. Apart from the several problems in such a model, particularly in a rapidly-moving technological paradigm or amid constantly-changing consumer preferences, Microsoft\u2019s track record of such acquisitions, Hotmail in 1997 for instance, has not been sparkling. If the purchase goes as reported, TikTok could become a millstone around its neck and Microsoft will end up salvaging the Chinese company but eroding its own value.   There are five reasons for this.   First, being a Made in China product, TikTok is already a political reject, as will several other apps from this aggressive nation trapped in a medieval mindset. Led by India, now the US has also banned TikTok; other countries, notably in Europe, will follow.   Second, as a result of this political rejection, the speculative value of the company, between $20 billion and $50 billion, will crash within months.   Third, there is no point buying country-limiting assets of TikTok when the ban is because of the underlying technology the product carries. Microsoft saying that the deal will be subject to a \u201csecurity review\u201d only serves to transfer the risk of the underlying technology from China to the US.   Fourth, questions arise about data. If Microsoft plans to ensure that \u201call private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States\u201d; where will the data of users in other countries, including India, be transferred to?   And fifth, the value of a tech brand or a social media brand is fleeting. TikTok is not a Coca Cola or a Disney. Like MySpace or Yahoo, it could get relegated to history faster than the videos loops it carries.   TikTok is a Made in China crisis, best left to implode.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

David Cicilline, D-R.I., chair of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law \\x97 last week turned up the heat by announcing a broad inquiry into digital competition. But now some experts question whether applying an antitrust lens to public concerns about tech companies\u2019 actions and missteps is the right approach.</p><p>The committee enveloping Cicilline\u2019s panel, the House Judiciary Committee, has announced it will start an inquiry into digital competition amid reports that the federal government is preparing antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. The lawmakers said they will try to determine whether tech companies, which they did not name, are engaging in anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>But that may be a challenge under existing antitrust law, some experts say.</p><p>The size and reach of the big tech companies are undeniable. Amazon sells almost everything you can imagine. Two of the world\u2019s most widely used sites, Facebook and Google, dominate online advertising, commanding more than 60% of the market. And both Amazon and Google now provide cloud services for companies big and small.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Warren says break up tech companies because they\u2019re big, which is not something antitrust law could inherently do,\u201d said Mark Lemley, professor of law at Stanford University, referring to the senator and presidential candidate\u2019s call to rein in the power of the big tech companies.</p><p>\u201cIt is not antitrust law driving this, necessarily. It\u2019s a combination of political and social factors. The tech industry is much less the golden child it was before the election ... because of the role it may have played in allowing Russia to influence the election.\u201d</p><p>Donald Polden, emeritus professor of law at Santa Clara University, said it is \u201cfashionable to hate tech companies right now,\u201d but that \u201cantitrust laws as we know them today are not very well designed for tech and platform markets.\u201d</p><p>Proving harm to consumers, a key tenet in antitrust law, may not be easy. \u201cThe rub here is that Google, Facebook and Amazon customers are not paying higher prices,\u201d Polden said.</p><p>Plus, the public may not care much, he said. Despite privacy scandals and data breaches involving the tech giants, and reports on poor labor conditions for Amazon warehouse workers or about Google\u2019s handling of workplace sexual-harassment allegations, a Pew Research poll last year found that 63% of Americans think technology companies\u2019 impact on society as a whole has been more positive than negative.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Polden said U.S. antitrust inquiries are \u201coverdue,\u201d particularly considering that European regulators have been looking into the tech giants\u2019 practices for years. They have fined Google three times in the past three years, for a total of $9.3 billion, doling out the latest fine in March over the company\u2019s online ad practices.</p><p>If anything comes out of U.S. antitrust efforts, it \u201ccould be legislation that buffs up antitrust laws with a consumer protection act,\u201d Polden said.</p><p>The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Reuters have reported that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have divided up the work of overseeing the four tech titans: The FTC supposedly is getting Facebook and Amazon, and the DOJ is handling Google and Apple. That could mean antitrust investigations are imminent, although Lemley said, \u201cSometimes it just means, hey, we are the people who will look at what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Google, the FTC and the DOJ all said they had no comment. Facebook and Amazon did not return requests for comment. In a Monday interview with CBS News, Apple CEO Tim Cook denied that his company is a monopoly, pointing out that Apple does not lead the market in smartphones worldwide.</p><p>NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group, slammed the reported antitrust investigations.</p><p>\u201cPointless antitrust attacks on American businesses risk stalling out America\u2019s tech leadership as competition from China is fiercer than ever before,\u201d said Carl Szabo, NetChoice vice president and general counsel, in a statement.</p><p>The growing backlash against tech giants is also coming from advocacy groups, shareholders and current and former employees. Complaints range from the companies having too much power \\x97 68% of Facebook\u2019s independent shareholders last week voted to separate the role of CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg, but the social networking firm\u2019s voting structure made their efforts moot \\x97 to repeated violations of user trust.</p><p>But even a Google engineer who is involved with the Tech Workers Coalition, which advocates for fair treatment of employees and other issues, expressed doubt that antitrust action would be helpful in the long term, noting the U.S. antitrust action a couple of decades ago against Microsoft.</p><p>\u201cEventually you end up with other monopolies,\u201d said the employee, who didn\u2019t want his name used. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>BIG TECH</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Ever since revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and a host of privacy scandals have roiled the waters surrounding Silicon Valley, tech\u2019s titans have faced increasing pressure from Congress, the public and Democratic presidential candidates.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Lawmakers \\x97 led by Rep.

Regulators are divvying up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants and lawmakers are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers.</p><p>After a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potential <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">antitrust</url> investigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Lawmakers in the House said on Monday that they were looking into the tech giants\u2019 possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that didn\u2019t exist when antitrust laws were written.</p><p>The question of whether tech companies violate antitrust laws has long been the subject of academic debates and industry griping. But now the industry is in the sights of President Trump, Democrats running for president, Congress and consumers. Silicon Valley has faced fierce criticism over disinformation, privacy breaches and political bias.</p><p>Investors pummeled technology stocks on Monday. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7 percent. Google and Amazon shares were also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">sharply lower,</url> and Apple\u2019s stock fell about 1 percent.</p><p>It does not appear that the agencies have opened official investigations. But the scrutiny from Washington could lead to years of headaches for the companies, raising the prospect of lawsuits to break up companies, hefty fines or new laws limiting their reach.</p><p>\u201cThis is about how do we get competition back in this space,\u201d Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday at a news conference. Mr. Cicilline is the chairman of the House Judiciary\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust, which during the next 18 months plans a set of hearings, testimony from executives from top companies, as well as subpoenas for internal corporate documents.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline said the investigation would focus on major digital platforms. The House committee on Monday informed four tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, of the plans. If the House investigation finds wrongdoing, lawmakers will pressure the Justice Department or the F.T.C. to investigate, he said.</p><p>\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d he said.</p><p>The F.T.C. and Justice Department declined to publicly comment Monday. All four companies also declined to comment, though they have rebutted accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the past.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. began negotiations over dividing up the responsibilities for overseeing competition in the tech sector, according to several people close to the discussions.</p><p>The two agencies often split responsibilities for reviewing mergers. But the recent negotiations show that both agencies were keen on looking into the companies, and that they had probably received complaints from rivals and others.</p><p>Two people close to President Trump said White House officials were supportive of the agencies\u2019 steps toward greater antitrust oversight over tech companies.</p><p>But the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, insisted there was no direct pressure on the agencies or involvement from Mr. Trump or any top West Wing officials. The officials attributed the moves to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees at the agencies.</p><p>One of the officials said antitrust issues had not recently been a focus of the president, and had not come up in Oval Office meetings with his economic advisers.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of involvement could be good news for the potential investigations: After he publicly opposed the AT&amp;amp;T-Time Warner merger, AT&amp;amp;T tried to use his comments in the case as a defense, saying the Justice Department was carrying out a political agenda.</p><p>\u201cBig tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement about the House investigation. \u201cAs tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.\u201d</p><p>It could be years before regulators take action or Congress passes new antitrust laws. Some consumer groups have called for regulators to break up the companies, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">the company must be broken up</url> in order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the breakup of any tech company.</p><p>Talk of antitrust is suddenly fashionable, but efforts by the government to break up companies have been rare, time-consuming and not always successful.</p><p>The government\u2019s case against IBM went on for 13 years before being dropped. The pursuit of AT&amp;amp;T lasted a decade until the company was broken into the seven Baby Bells. The government chased Microsoft for 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation until a settlement was approved by an appeals court.</p><p>One reason for the slow pace: If you\u2019re big enough to be drawing antitrust heat, you\u2019re big enough to have a lot of lobbyists, lawyers and employees in congressional districts all around the country.</p><p>In recent decades, a reinterpretation of traditional antitrust theory created a major barrier to regulatory action.</p><p>Robert Bork, a former federal judge and conservative legal theorist, argued in his 1978 book, \u201cThe Antitrust Paradox,\u201d that if the government protected weaker competitors, it would make businesses less efficient, raising prices for consumers.</p><p>His consumer welfare standard \u2014 all that counts is what happens in the consumer\u2019s wallet \u2014 has been widely used by courts, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>This interpretation of antitrust helps big tech companies. It is difficult to argue that consumers are being robbed \u2014 the argument made by the Senate for passing the original antitrust laws more than a century ago \u2014 when companies like Google and Facebook do not charge users. Amazon prides itself on charging low prices.</p><p>\u201cFederal enforcers have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d said Sarah Miller, the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that is critical of the giant tech companies.</p><p>The antitrust law in Europe is more receptive to the recent complaints about large tech companies, and critics of the businesses have pursued actions there.</p><p>European regulators <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">fined Google 1.5 billion euros</url> this year for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. It was the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.</p><p>European regulators have expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s dominance in music. In March, Spotify, the music streaming service, filed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">competition complaint with European regulators</url> about how Apple controlled its app store. Spotify accused Apple of unfairly charging fees to its competitors and imposing burdensome rules about marketing.</p><p>Apple has argued that the fees are reasonable given that it operates the App Store. It argues that the App Store also gives Spotify and other companies access to millions of potential customers.</p><p>Ms. Miller said she wasn\u2019t holding her breath that the new government steps would change the American approach.</p><p>\u201cTime will tell if this announcement leads to meaningful action,\u201d she said.</p><p>Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @ceciliakang.

Regulators are divvying up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants and lawmakers are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potential antitrust investigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers in the House said on Monday that they were looking into the tech giants' possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that didn't exist when antitrust laws were written.</p><p>The question of whether tech companies violate antitrust laws has long been the subject of academic debates and industry griping. But now the industry is in the sights of President Trump, Democrats running for president, Congress and consumers. Silicon Valley has faced fierce criticism over disinformation, privacy breaches and political bias.</p><p>Investors pummeled technology stocks on Monday. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7 percent. Google and Amazon shares were also sharply lower, and Apple's stock fell about 1 percent.</p><p>It does not appear that the agencies have opened official investigations. But the scrutiny from Washington could lead to years of headaches for the companies, raising the prospect of lawsuits to break up companies, hefty fines or new laws limiting their reach.</p><p>\"This is about how do we get competition back in this space,\" Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday at a news conference. Mr. Cicilline is the chairman of the House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust, which during the next 18 months plans a set of hearings, testimony from executives from top companies, as well as subpoenas for internal corporate documents.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline said the investigation would focus on major digital platforms. The House committee on Monday informed four tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, of the plans. If the House investigation finds wrongdoing, lawmakers will pressure the Justice Department or the F.T.C. to investigate, he said.</p><p>\"This is long overdue,\" he said.</p><p>The F.T.C. and Justice Department declined to publicly comment Monday. All four companies also declined to comment, though they have rebutted accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the past.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. began negotiations over dividing up the responsibilities for overseeing competition in the tech sector, according to several people close to the discussions.</p><p>The two agencies often split responsibilities for reviewing mergers. But the recent negotiations show that both agencies were keen on looking into the companies, and that they had probably received complaints from rivals and others.</p><p>Two people close to President Trump said White House officials were supportive of the agencies' steps toward greater antitrust oversight over tech companies.</p><p>But the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, insisted there was no direct pressure on the agencies or involvement from Mr. Trump or any top West Wing officials. The officials attributed the moves to Mr. Trump's appointees at the agencies.</p><p>One of the officials said antitrust issues had not recently been a focus of the president, and had not come up in Oval Office meetings with his economic advisers.</p><p>Mr. Trump's lack of involvement could be good news for the potential investigations: After he publicly opposed the AT&amp;amp;T-Time Warner merger, AT&amp;amp;T tried to use his comments in the case as a defense, saying the Justice Department was carrying out a political agenda.</p><p>\"Big tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" Representative Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement about the House investigation. \"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.\"</p><p>It could be years before regulators take action or Congress passes new antitrust laws. Some consumer groups have called for regulators to break up the companies, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has said the company must be broken up in order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the breakup of any tech company.</p><p>Talk of antitrust is suddenly fashionable, but efforts by the government to break up companies have been rare, time-consuming and not always successful.</p><p>The government's case against IBM went on for 13 years before being dropped. The pursuit of AT&amp;amp;T lasted a decade until the company was broken into the seven Baby Bells. The government chased Microsoft for 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation until a settlement was approved by an appeals court.</p><p>One reason for the slow pace: If you're big enough to be drawing antitrust heat, you're big enough to have a lot of lobbyists, lawyers and employees in congressional districts all around the country.</p><p>In recent decades, a reinterpretation of traditional antitrust theory created a major barrier to regulatory action.</p><p>Robert Bork, a former federal judge and conservative legal theorist, argued in his 1978 book, \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" that if the government protected weaker competitors, it would make businesses less efficient, raising prices for consumers.</p><p>His consumer welfare standard - all that counts is what happens in the consumer's wallet - has been widely used by courts, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>This interpretation of antitrust helps big tech companies. It is difficult to argue that consumers are being robbed - the argument made by the Senate for passing the original antitrust laws more than a century ago - when companies like Google and Facebook do not charge users. Amazon prides itself on charging low prices.</p><p>\"Federal enforcers have a lot of catching up to do,\" said Sarah Miller, the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that is critical of the giant tech companies.</p><p>The antitrust law in Europe is more receptive to the recent complaints about large tech companies, and critics of the businesses have pursued actions there.</p><p>European regulators fined Google 1.5 billion euros this year for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. It was the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.</p><p>European regulators have expressed concerns about Apple's dominance in music. In March, Spotify, the music streaming service, filed a competition complaint with European regulators about how Apple controlled its app store. Spotify accused Apple of unfairly charging fees to its competitors and imposing burdensome rules about marketing.</p><p>Apple has argued that the fees are reasonable given that it operates the App Store. It argues that the App Store also gives Spotify and other companies access to millions of potential customers.</p><p>Ms. Miller said she wasn't holding her breath that the new government steps would change the American approach.</p><p>\"Time will tell if this announcement leads to meaningful action,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @ceciliakang.

The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee held a hearing Tuesday on the market power of the largest tech companies. Executives from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google and Facebook are testifying.</p><p>The head of the House antitrust panel, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, slammed the dominance of the tech companies, saying they are shielded from competitive threats because of barriers to rivals that could potentially take them on. They also use their resources to prevent startups from challenging them and pose a risk to small businesses, he said.</p><p>Cicilline said the dominance of tech companies stems from policy choices. Antitrust enforcers haven't challenged a single one of their acquisitions or sued them for anticompetitive conduct like they did with Microsoft Corp. 20 years ago, he said.</p><p>\"Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Cicilline said in his opening remarks. \"As a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>\"Together, these enforcement decisions have created a de facto immunity for online platforms,\" Cicilline added.</p><p>The four tech giants tried to head off criticism that they dominate their respective markets, as executives in prepared testimony all cited intense competition they say they face from rivals.</p><p>Nate Sutton, a lawyer for Amazon, which controls about half of U.S. e-commerce sales, told the House antitrust panel that the company makes up just 4% of U.S. retail sales, with competition from Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co.</p><p>Facebook's Director of Public Policy Matt Perault pointed to competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, among others, in his remarks.</p><p>The companies also touted their development of innovative products that have won over consumers and their investment in research and development. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said the company spent $21.4 billion on R&amp;D, three times more than in 2013.</p><p>The hearing, led by Cicilline, started at about 3 p.m. Dozens of people were waiting in line to get into the hearing room.</p><p>The hearing is one of a several that big tech companies face this week in Congress as Washington calls the giants to task for a range of concerns. President Donald Trump is pressuring the companies in Twitter barrages for issues including anti-conservative bias, while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have taken the first steps toward investigating their conduct. The Justice Department is taking responsibility for scrutiny of Google and Apple, as the FTC oversees Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, David Marcus, who leads Facebook's Libra and block chain efforts, heard from disdainful Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the company's proposed cryptocurrency.</p><p>Trump said Tuesday that his administration will look into allegations by billionaire Peter Thiel that Google's work with China is \"seemingly treasonous.\"</p><p>Trump has also said he wants gather tech executives at the White House.</p><p>Google's global public policy chief is scheduled to testify Tuesday before a Senate hearing focused on allegations the company engages in censorship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAPDNW-ndn-1873231957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAPDNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-2KC1-DYJJ-P3VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naples Daily News (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000274L</classCode><className>KROGER CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is so closely associated with the school that the thinking is widely known as ''the Chicago School of antitrust.''</p><p>  But amid growing concerns about the unchecked power of today's tech giants, economists and legal scholars are questioning whether the Chicago School still makes sense. Even the university's own faculty is starting to publicly challenge the ideology.</p><p>  At a convocation ceremony in June, Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the university's Booth School of Business, warned about the corrosive influence of monopolies and declared that the Chicago School had a blind spot when it came to Big Tech.</p><p>  ''Our antitrust laws cannot do anything against these types of monopolies,'' said Mr. Zingales, who is the head of the university's George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, in his address. ''The world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too.''</p><p>  A 56-year-old native of Padua, Italy, who has taught at the school since 1992, Mr. Zingales adheres to many of the traditional hallmarks of University of Chicago economics -- free markets, small government and low taxes. But he is not an ideologue. After the financial crisis, he opposed breaking up the big banks but said later that he had been wrong.</p><p>  His recent work laments that the American capitalist system has become corrupted by cronyism and companies that are too big, too powerful and too enmeshed with the overall economy.</p><p>  When the Federal Trade Commission decided to close a broad investigation into Google without taking any action in 2013, Mr. Zingales said in a recent interview, it was clear that regulators were not sufficiently aggressive going after the new monopolies.</p><p>  Although never shy about speaking out -- he predicted in 2011 that Donald J. Trump could win the presidency -- Mr. Zingales became more vocal about the need for the Chicago School position to evolve. He said that today's tech giants were ''unprecedented in nature'' and that the rules of traditional economics did not apply to these companies.</p><p>  For the last three years, Mr. Zingales and the Stigler Center have hosted an antitrust summit. The 2018 and 2019 conferences focused on how to deal with digital platforms like Google and Facebook. He gathered most of the leading antitrust scholars, a handful of top regulators, judges and attorneys general to come up with proposals on how monopoly policy should deal with the tech giants.</p><p>  Discussions at those two conferences have been echoed in recent decisions by the Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general to investigate antitrust claims against Big Tech.</p><p>  At last year's summit, Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, told attendees that his view of the cost of free platforms ''has changed'' with a greater understanding of the nature and scope of data collection and sharing.</p><p>  An attorney general at this year's conference, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, was one of the main speakers when states announced an antitrust investigation into Google last week.</p><p>  ''The fact that you have prominent people at Chicago calling for antitrust enforcement is changing the game,'' said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is the author of ''The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age'' and contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.</p><p>  Mr. Zingales started a podcast with Kate Waldock, an assistant professor of finance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, in 2018 called ''Capitalisn't'' about what works well in the current economy and what does not.</p><p>  Their first episode called for more antitrust enforcement of Facebook and Google, centered on the idea of how dangerous it would be if Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, decided to run for president -- which didn't seem so far-fetched at the time.</p><p>  The Chicago School started to gain prominence in the 1970s in response to concerns about overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. It argued that it was not enough for companies to possess significant market power; regulators and judges had to prove through economic analysis that consumers were harmed through higher prices.</p><p>  The ideology has influenced a generation of judges and regulators, who have taken a restrained approach to antitrust enforcement in the United States based, in part, on the belief that market forces would correct imbalances better.</p><p>  The Chicago School has greased the wheels for the megamergers that have reshaped many industries while providing the intellectual justification for why today's tech giants are not dangerous monopolies. It's hard to argue that Google's or Facebook's market power is hurting prices when their products do not cost money and Amazon -- while not free -- is celebrated for its convenience and prices.</p><p>  Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the Booth Business School with Mr. Zingales, said he still didn't see a serious alternative to the Chicago School for formulating antitrust policy. He also said there was little evidence that more regulation led to better outcomes for consumers.</p><p>  ''Most of what I see from companies like Amazon, Google and Apple is that they are successful because they do well in the competitive battle,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''The difference between him and I is that he sees a failure of competition, whereas I see the success of the companies.''</p><p>  Mr. Murphy said, however, that there was not a monolithic view among the university's faculty, especially since many of the professors hadn't been trained at the University of Chicago.</p><p>  ''They would probably agree more with what Luigi is saying compared to what I'm saying,'' he said.</p><p>  But Mr. Zingales said the tech industry's network-driven business models -- based on the notion that a service or a product becomes more useful and valuable as more people rely on it -- was a relatively new area of study for economics.</p><p>  Powerful monopolies like Google are a potential threat to democracy, Mr. Zingales added, because they hold so much sway over what we read. Google declined to comment.</p><p>  Mr. Zingales also noted that the ideology failed to capture the risk of a monopoly's exerting influence to persuade regulators and politicians.</p><p>  In his address, Mr. Zingales implored the graduates to push back against today's tech behemoths, just as the colonists had resisted the monopoly of Britain's East India Company during the Boston Tea Party. He urged the audience to vote for politicians willing to stand up to Silicon Valley.</p><p>  ''This country was born fighting monopolies,'' said Mr. Zingales, who still speaks with a noticeable Italian accent. ''To fight monopolies, your power as workers, consumers and investors is not sufficient. Your participation in the political process is critical. This is not a Republican or Democratic battle. It's an American battle.''</p><p>  Then he addressed the elephant in the room.</p><p>  ''My conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,'' he said. ''It's a method of intellectual inquiry without the blinders imposed by conventional wisdom.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Professor Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago is calling for an evolving position on antitrust thinking.

The question is, can the CMA pull it off?</p><p>He wants the British competition watchdog to have the power to impose fines \u2014 at the moment it has to go through the UK courts to do so \u2014 and the ability to stop alleged anti-competitive behaviour by dominant online platforms while investigations are ongoing.</p><p>He has also been quite vocal about scrutinising acquisitions by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis>and other large US tech giants, with a view to potentially blocking them.

The stock has fallen 20 percent since its record close of $1,296.20 on April 29.</p><p>And new reports surfaced that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have arranged to expand and divvy up oversight of tech giants Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. Reportedly, the latest development hinges on an agreement between the two arms of the federal government, with the FTC helming antitrust probes into Amazon and Facebook and the Justice Department investigating <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/brazil-magazine-luiza-google-amazon-1203144691/\">Google</url> and Apple.</p><p>That helped pressure shares of the tech giants.</p><p>Facebook's stock fell 7.5 percent to $164.15 as Twitter dropped 5.5 percent to $34.43 and Amazon lost 4.6 percent to $1,692.69 and Apple slipped 1 percent to $173.30.</p><p>The news arrived as Apple took the stage at its Worldwide Developers Conference to reveal updates for its wearable, mobile and desktop technologies, sending Apple stock lower on a day that would normally perk up shares as investors reset to what is starting to look like a new regulatory backdrop for Silicon Valley.</p><p>For Google, if an antitrust probe did materialize, it would be the latest in a long line of investigations into the company's search and advertising business. A 2011 case, in which the Federal Trade Commission took aim at Google's use of cookies to track Safari web browser users, led to a $22.5 million fine. In Europe, the European Commission took issue with how Google ranked search results in its shopping platform in 2017 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/google-european-union-antitrust-fine-over-adsense-1203088619/\">fined the company again this year for anti-competitive practices</url>.</p><p>The stock drop comes as the giant pushes forward with growth initiatives, including a new cloud platform and shopping efforts.</p><p>Google and other major tech companies have become the subject of heightened criticisms over the power they wield as their ability to collect and crunch personal data grows. Calls to break up \"Big Tech\" have become a drumbeat in some circles, with Democratic representatives, presidential candidates and others turning the issue into a platform.</p><p>Earlier this year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren hit the campaign trail urging the break-up of major tech firms such as Facebook and Google. And while Silicon Valley as a whole might lean more toward regulation than monopoly-busting, Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes penned an op-ed for The New York Times a few weeks ago that supported the break-up bandwagon.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/brazil-magazine-luiza-google-amazon-1203144691/\">How Brazil's Magazine Luiza Out-Amazoned Amazon</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/suresh-kumar-named-walmarts-new-cto-1203141264/\">Walmart Taps Google Exec Suresh Kumar</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/kering-nike-copenhagen-fashion-summit-stella-mccartney-calvin-klein-google-1203132706/\">Copenhagen Summit Preaches Urgency for Fashion</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1203147570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W84-VFY1-DYJW-X1DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The immediate impact is on hundreds of thousands of Federal workers - 380,000 are on leave without pay; 420,000; others have to work but aren't getting a paycheck. And then, get this. If you want to reach the White House about any of this or anything, for that matter, this is what you'll get.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: We apologize, but due to the lapse in Federal funding, we are unable to take your call. Once funding has been restored, our operations will resume.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLDUAN: Two other important numbers to remember today. December 27th, Thursday - that's when the Senate comes back. January 3rd, that's the day the new Congress is seated.</p><p>Joining me now to discuss, former Republican Congressman and current CNN political commentator Charlie Dent.</p><p>Congressman, it's great to see you. You have seen your fair share of shutdowns. And I'm just talking about this year. Does this shutdown seem different than others?</p><p>CHARLIE DENT, FORMER PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN: Yes, this one does because I think there's a - because of the President's erratic behavior, I mean, this shutdown in my view is completely unnecessary. The appropriations process actually had moved pretty well this year.</p><p>Five of the 12 bills were already signed into law in September. And of the seven remaining, six are teed up, ready to go, they could pass those today if they wanted to. The fight is over the Homeland Security appropriations bill, and over the wall funding and so all they really need to do is punt that bill into the new year and do the other six now, and problem solved.</p><p>But obviously, it's going to be more complicated than that. But the President's position though is unclear. He had a deal last week that they are going to do a continuing resolution into February 8. And then he reversed himself. So if you're a Senate Republican right now, I would think the Senate Republicans must be out of their minds over this.</p><p>They're not going to put up another bill on the floor of the House or the Senate until they're certain that the President will actually sign the thing.</p><p>BOLDUAN: And that actually is an important point. I mean, being able to trust any deal that the president agrees to is a real question now, because as you point out, there was a deal between Democrats and the White House. It passed the Senate and then Trump changed his mind.</p><p>Is there any way - I mean, honestly, if you're still there, if there's any way to trust any deal that the President agrees to at this point when it comes to this? I mean, his track record is - well, it is what it is.</p><p>DENT: Well, you know, I think that the challenge that this White House has is that nobody really speaks for the President. There was just a story yesterday, I guess, the Vice President, Mick Mulvaney, and somebody else went down and met with the - some of the Senate leaders, and are they really speaking for the President? I think the short answer is, they are not. So I think that's really the problem.</p><p>We had an appropriations bill, you may remember, it was last March, the big Omnibus, which was negotiated. I helped negotiate that bill. And everything was worked out and agreed to. The President got what he wanted. And then in the 11th hour, somebody was screaming about the magnitude of the bill, the size of the bill, and he threatened to veto a bill that he had agreed to.</p><p>Now, in the end, he signed it, but that does not inspire any type confidence if the President is so whimsical and does not empower his staff to negotiate or speak on his behalf.</p><p>BOLDUAN: So there are a couple of things, right? You've got border wall as a big sticking point. But there's always two parts to the border wall conversation. It's not just build the wall, the second part was of course was that Mexico is going to pay for it.</p><p>I want to play for you what the now acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney said about this just yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But none of that is Mexico paying for the wall. Let's just be clear about this.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, INCOMING CHIEF OF STAFF FOR THE PRESIDENT: Technically, you and I both know that it cannot work exactly like that, I can't spend any money at the Office of Management Budget ...</p><p>[13:35:09]</p><p>MULVANEY: ... that the Department of Homeland Security can't actually spend money from Mexico, we have to get it from the Treasury. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLDUAN: It doesn't actually work like that, says Mick Mulvaney. So now, they can't spend the money if it would come from Mexico. I watched that thinking, do you think it would change the dynamic of this whole thing if the President would just once and for all admit, acknowledge, say, that he knows that Mexico isn't going to pay for it?</p><p>DENT: That would certainly help. It was absurd to state in the first place that Mexico was going to pay for this wall. Nobody who had anything between their ears ever believed that, let's be honest about that. Now he is also - the President has also floated the idea of having the Department of Defense build the wall. Now, I can tell you as the guy who ran military construction projects for the appropriations committee, the Defense Department cannot do that. They don't have the authority.</p><p>But for 37 miles on the Gold Water Range in Arizona, where they could build some fencing. That's it. That's the only authority the Defense Department has and they haven't really sent over a request to do so, last I checked.</p><p>So I don't know. The President said that Mexicans will pay for it. He said the Defense Department will build it, which they can't. So you know, he says a lot of things that just simply aren't factual and it really makes no sense.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Congressman, I am struck by - I remember our conversation when you announced your retirement that frustration with the President was one of the reason, just one, there were many other reasons for you to retire.</p><p>As we're sitting here today, are you having any second thoughts?</p><p>DENT: Well, you know, I guess I could say, not my problem today. But on a serious note, it is a big problem. We're talking about not just a shutdown here, a crisis in leadership.</p><p>With the resignation of Secretary Mattis, with the repudiation frankly of the Trump doctrine. The president threatening to fire the Chairman of the Federal Reserve for doing his job and trying to bring about some kind of monetary normalization with interest rates. You know, we had that crazy week with Flynn and Cohen and of course the precipitous Syria withdrawal.</p><p>All of these issues are creating a climate of crisis. And the markets of course are spooked. Mnuchin today making his comments, calling the banks, saying, \"Hey, you know, you have nothing to panic about,\" which of course makes people think immediately, you know, \"Should I panic?\"</p><p>And so we have all of this happening, and I think that's what's discouraging to so many people. I've spoken to people over the last couple of days and this market turmoil is really getting a lot of folks' attention.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Yes, and not going away. Thank you so much, great to see you, Congressman.</p><p>DENT: Thank you, Kate, great to be with you.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Thank you. We'll be right back.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>BOLDUAN: Indonesia is reeling after a deadly tsunami killing nearly 400 people. Ivan Watson has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>IVAN WATSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The death toll from Indonesia's deadly tsunami Saturday night surged on Monday, even as recovery efforts have been hampered and complicated by warnings from local authorities that they are afraid there could be another deadly tsunami.</p><p>This is all because of an active volcano, a volcanic island that is known in Indonesia as Anak Krakatau that erupted on Saturday and sent more than 150 acres, Indonesian authorities say, of mountainside plunging into the sea. They believe that subsequent underwater landslide triggered the deadly wall of water that hit the shores in resort communities in Indonesia that were full of Indonesian tourists on what was supposed to be a Christmas weekend holiday.</p><p>Instead we saw scenes like that concert that was tragically cut short Saturday night of the Indonesian pop band, \"Seventeen\" when the wall of water crashed through the stage and overwhelmed both the band and the audience.</p><p>In that tragic story, it turns out that the lead singer of the band says three of his band members were killed and his wife is still believed to be missing.</p><p>So the efforts now are focused on trying to bring wounded, injured people to the hospitals and also trying to provide temporary shelter and basic supplies and food to thousands of people made homeless by this tsunami. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BOLDUAN: Ivan, thanks so much. Just horrible. Coming up for us, it was a short trading day on Wall Street and an ugly one, too. Details on the selloff, next.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>BOLDUAN: The continued market turmoil today, just one of the major business headlines of 2018. Christine Romans and Richard Quest take us through.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Iconic American industries transformed.

This year, two-decades-old iconic American retailers closed up shop.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, ANCHOR, CNN: A dramatic fall for what used to be one of the United States' largest retailers, Sears filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The last generation of Toys \"R\" Us kids have spoken across the U.S. all of it still as we are now closed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Toys \"R\" Us and Sears struggled to keep up with retail's digital transformations. Stores like Target, Macy's and Walmart are investing millions on in their websites mobile apps. The goal, compete with Amazon.</p><p>The online behemoth dominates the industry with billion-dollar profits and a trillion-dollar market value. Granting its CEO a coveted title.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all-time.</p><p>[13:50:01]</p><p>QUEST: Two new locations will feel Amazon's power. New York City and Northern Virginia. They won a year-long competition for its second headquarters.</p><p>ROMANS: Number seven, auto companies reckon with the future. Americans are shunning sedans for SUVs and that's changing the industry.</p><p>Ford will drop all but two passenger cars from its lineup by the year 2020. And General Motors is restructuring its workforce, an announcement that sent shock waves through America's heartland and Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, ANCHOR, CNN: General Motors, the iconic American automaker, is cutting staff and closing plants.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: President Trump slammed GM's decision to shutter five North American factories, costing 14,000 jobs. But U.S. automakers say it's evolve or die. They are investing in self-driving and electric cars to compete with each other and their new rivals in Silicon Valley.</p><p>QUEST: Number six, Trump versus the Federal Reserve. In 2017, President Trump praised his pick for Fed chief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's strong, he's committed, he's smart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Well, that didn't last long. The President breaking precedent by repeatedly criticizing Jerome Powell for raising interest rates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: the fed is out of control.</p><p>I'm not happy with what he's doing.</p><p>We have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Historically, Presidents always avoid confronting the Central Bank. It's supposed to operate independently from political influence. So President Trump's attacks may have unintended consequences. If the Fed suddenly slows the pace of rate hikes, that could raise concern it's bowing to political pressure.</p><p>Or the President could do exactly the opposite of what he intended. The Fed may feel it has to raise rates to show it's not surrendered.</p><p>ROMANS: Number five, Elon Musk's erratic behavior cost Tesla and himself. Many credit Tesla's incredible market value to belief in Musk as an innovator, but this year his actions caused many to question his leadership, like slamming analysts on an investor call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Boring bonehead, questions are not cool. Next.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Smoking marijuana during a live broadcast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE ROGAN, PODCAST HOST: It's totally legal.</p><p>MUSK: Okay.</p><p>ROGAN: It's tobacco and marijuana in there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Calling a British cave diver involved in the Thai soccer team rescue a pedophile. And of course, the fiasco over potentially taking Tesla private. Musk stunned investors in August when he tweeted he had secured funding to take the company private, a plan he has since abandoned. That triggered a jump in Tesla's stock price as well as scrutiny from Wall Street's top regulator.</p><p>The SEC concluded Musk misled investors, forcing him to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman to settle those charges.</p><p>QUEST: It's number four. Wall Street's wild swings. Now, 2018 started with a bang, and then trading turned volatile.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, ANCHOR, CNN: Happening now, breaking news. Wild ride. Another dizzying day on Wall Street, with stocks nosediving more than a thousand points for the second time this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: In February, the Dow lost 3,200 points in just two weeks when inflation fears ramped up. Stocks recovered, as corporate tax cuts juiced profits. But then came the tech stock meltdown that dragged the whole market lower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Very scary October in the markets.</p><p>DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: Stock market just had its worst month since 2011.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Breaking news, the Dow plunging more than 500 points yet again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Trade fears, rising interest rates, Brexit chaos, slowing growth, recession concerns, all of them putting strain on a bull market that's already the longest in history.</p><p>ROMANS: Number three, President Trump took on the world, turning his tough trade talk into action, slapping tariffs on foreign, steel, and aluminum, ripping up NAFTA for the USMCA, and trashing America's neighbor in the process.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Canada has treated us very badly. We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: But what really unsettled investors, a trade war between the world's two biggest newest economies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, ANCHOR, CNN: The President announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Well, China shot right back, saying it will retaliate with countermeasures.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: China and the U.S. hit each other with tariffs on billions of dollars of goods. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary trade truce in December. Investors hope that could lead to the real deal. But that could be complicated by the recent arrest of the CFO of a Chinese tech giant in Canada.</p><p>Number two, unemployment hits historic lows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Three point seven percent unemployment in the month of September. A 49-year low.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The U.S. labor market is strong, adding jobs for the past 98 months in a row, but as the U.S. nears what's known as full employment, employers will ...</p><p>[13:55:10]</p><p>ROMANS: ... struggle to find workers, hiring may slow, but for now, job gains are solid and wages finally started to rise. A missing piece of the recovery so far.</p><p>QUEST: Number one. Facebook scandals, which sewed distrust in big tech. In March, Facebook revealed it exposed 87 million users to a third party app. It angered users, advertisers, lawmakers, and investors.</p><p>ROMANS: The data crises was a hit to Facebook's reputation, already tarnished for its role in spreading misinformation and allowing election meddling. It led to an apology tour for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, concluding with a grilling on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I started Facebook, I run it.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources. The Department believes maintaining a domestic climate for state of the art security and encryption is critical to the protection of our national security.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> Of course, the Pentagon isn't saying anything that anyone who has a professional requirement for encryption or who uses encrypted services in areas like commerce, law, banking and intra-government communications doesn't know already: once you have backdoors into encrypted systems, they're open to everyone, not just the goons of the Australian Federal Police or the FBI -- a message that global village idiots like Dutton will never understand.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY2-H331-JD6R-T14W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><timeReceived>10:02:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.

In October, Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton attacked Google and Facebook, as well as other tech companies that provide encrypted services such as Apple, for \"protecting paedophiles\" by refusing to let security agencies of the Five Eyes countries have backdoor access to their systems.  Throwing references to paedophiles around is a bit risky for Dutton. As it turned out, the company doing the most to help paedophiles in Australia was Westpac, shortly afterward exposed as providing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/what-is-westpac-accused-of-and-how-is-this-related-to-child-exploitation-explainer\">a payment system used by child abusers</url>. Dutton and his Liberal colleagues, of course, have been happy to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from Westpac over the years and run a protection racket against effective regulation and consumer protection in financial services.  But never mind that: last week Dutton also labelled tech execs \"morally bankrupt\" for failing to give governments unfettered access to the private communications of their citizens. Facebook, meanwhile, is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2019/10/31/facebook-is-testing-end-to-end-encryption-for-secret-messenger-calls/\">actually extending encryption</url> across all its services, including Facebook Messenger. </p><p> The likes of Dutton and his counterparts in the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, are hoping to cash in on the global wave of loathing and revulsion toward big tech and especially Facebook, a giant machine that appears hellbent on monetising its users no matter what the damage inflicted on civil society by sociopaths, political manipulators and fascist groups.  But when it comes to encryption, Facebook, normally intensely hostile to privacy, is on the side of the angels in committing to ensuring that malignant online actors like security agencies have difficulty accessing citizens' private communications. As events in Australia this year have demonstrated, governments are as likely to use laws aimed at defeating encryption to pursue whistleblowers, journalists and those who embarrass it as they are to go after paedophiles and terrorists.  Indeed, Dutton's own portfolio is ground zero for the phenomenon of government agencies using the excuse of national security to relentlessly pursue those who have exposed agencies' shortcomings while happily handing over secret information to stenographers in News Corp keen to act as government propagandists.  And Dutton can attack Facebook all he likes; the business models of major tech companies now rely on being able to assure consumers that their products are safe -- especially given western governments have been so vocal about the security threats posed by Chinese tech companies. Facebook is unlikely indeed to ever heed Dutton's complaints, even if they end up backed by legislation.  Zuckerberg and co have very deep pockets and a lot of lawyers, and the company is unlikely to be giving into demands for encryption backdoors, especially in minor markets like Australia, any time soon.  If only there was a neutral party that both had in-depth knowledge of encryption but also understood the need for secrecy of the highest order to provide a perspective on this clash between privacy and the desire of governments to undermine their citizens' most basic rights.  Ladies and gentleman, say hello to the Pentagon.  The US Senate Judiciary Committee, controlled by Republican Lindsey Graham, has been conducting an inquiry into encryption, with the goal of shaming tech companies over their refusal to cave into demands for backdoors. Inconveniently, however, Californian congressman Ro Khanna last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6572247-DOD-encryption-letter-Khanna.html\">forwarded to Graham a letter</url> from the Pentagon's Chief Information Officer, Dana Deasy, about encryption. What is the Pentagon's view about the importance of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The Department... requires that data-in-transit, on [Department of Defence]-issued mobile devices, be encrypted (e.g. VPN) to protect DoD information and resources. The importance of strong encryption and VPNs for our mobile workforce is imperative.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> So strong encryption is important to defence. How does it see the future of encryption? </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>...it is imperative that innovative security techniques, such as advanced encryption algorithms, are constantly maintained and improved to protect DoD information and resources.
