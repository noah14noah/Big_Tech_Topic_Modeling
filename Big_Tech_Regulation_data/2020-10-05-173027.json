The latest was spotted in a recent SEC filing and shows the two companies reached a new multi-year agreement that sent Broadcom's shares up two percent in after-hours trading. Broadcom's tech is slowly eating the world[1], even as many of us are unaware of its presence in many of our favorite gadgets. </p><p>The company's reach is so powerful that it has US and EU regulators probing every aspect of its business to make sure it doesn't abuse its dominance in key semiconductor markets. Recently, the silicon giant revealed in an SEC filing[2] spotted by the Wall Street Journal that it has signed a new agreement with Apple for \"the supply of a range of specified high-performance wireless components and modules.\" The company already has a deal inked in 2019 for \"RF components and modules\" which are used in iPhones and iPads, making up about $10 of the bill of materials if you go by JP Morgan's estimates[3].This could mean that Broadcom could rake in no less than $15 billion in revenue over the next three and a half years, which is a big win for the company.It's no secret that Apple is one of Broadcom's largest customers, accounting for somewhere between 20 to 25 percent of its net revenue over the last two years. Back in December, the rumor mill was abuzz with reports[4] that Broadcom was exploring a potential sale of its RF division for around $10 billion.Given Apple's appetite for strategic acquisitions that give it more control over key components that go into its products, it wouldn't be surprising to see it snapping Broadcom's RF unit. The only deal-breaker might be the asking price, as Apple only paid $1 billion for Intel's modem division in a deal latter described by one of the parts as grossly undervalued[5].

All of this came into focus as the company tried their luck at a hostile takeover of Qualcomm for over $100 billion, which was recently shot down by Trump's executive order. But that didn't stop it from shelling out $18.9 billion for CA Technologies, a software and services company that helps it expand its reach to corporate customers.<br/> The company naturally disagrees with the allegations, but the antitrust battle could bubble up in the E.U., and while Broadcom told regulators it doesn't expect any material impact from the interim ban, the Commission can hit it with fines of up to 10% of its global revenues - or something around $2 billion, which are already suffering from the Huawei ban.<br/> It's easy to look at this and dismiss it as yet another battle between regulators and big tech that will take years to get to a conclusion. Most people don't know that Broadcom's chips are inside almost every gadget you might have, powering internet connectivity in everything from phones to laptops, routers, and IoT devices such as the Raspberry Pi 4.<br/> The effects of the investigations could affect both manufacturers and consumers.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11064196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG8-R3D1-JBYT-H3FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002GD1</classCode><className>BROADCOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000248A</classCode><className>CA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Both the U.S. and E.U are investigating the company for abusing its dominance in the semiconductor market, which could have serious implications for everyone. The European Commission has recently opened an antitrust investigation[1] into Broadcom, one of the largest players in the semiconductor industry, amid concerns that it has been using exclusivity deals in order to corner the competition. </p><p>The investigation is focused on the company's chipsets found in many modems and TV set-top boxes, and there is a proposal for an interim ban on the alleged contractual restrictions in order \"to avoid any risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition.\"Broadcom is also under fire[2] by the US Federal Trade Commission, whose investigation is similar in scope, citing abusive practices in the sale of chipsets found in Wi-Fi and Ethernet chips. All of this came into focus as the company tried their luck at a hostile takeover of Qualcomm for over $100 billion, which was recently shot down[3] by Trump's executive order. But that didn't stop it from shelling out $18.9 billion for CA Technologies, a software and services company that helps it expand its reach to corporate customers.The company naturally disagrees with the allegations, but the antitrust battle could bubble up in the E.U., and while Broadcom told regulators it doesn't expect any material impact from the interim ban, the Commission can hit it with fines of up to 10% of its global revenues - or something around $2 billion, which are already suffering from the Huawei ban[4].It's easy to look at this and dismiss it as yet another battle between regulators and big tech that will take years to get to a conclusion. Most people don't know that Broadcom's chips are inside almost every gadget you might have, powering internet connectivity in everything from phones[5] to laptops, routers, and IoT devices such as the Raspberry Pi 4[6]. The effects of the investigations could affect both manufacturers and consumers.

This is a session I've been looking forward to all day, which is the opportunity to speak with a senior leader of Broadridge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just to introduce myself, I'm Jason Gurandiano. I run the fintech franchise here at RBC and have been doing fintech for over 20 years, which means I'm one of the few people who might actually have done it almost as long as Vince Roux, who's the Head of Corporate Development at Broadridge. So I don't know what it says about Vince and I, but we have roles. So that's definitely one conclusion you can draw.</p><p>When I think through the evolution of the fintech landscape, I've been amazed at some companies that had been there early and haven't evolved and some companies who -- and this is meant to be praise, by the way, before I go there, who started off with a legacy footprint and have evolved at a pace that exceeded who you've might have thought as being a market leader previously. So my hats off to Broadridge. And most impressive, I think, in your case has been the combination of both organic initiatives, the ability to see where the puck is going, because we are a Canadian bank, as well as inorganic initiatives and in deploying capital in a smart fashion.</p><p>And so I can't give you a better lead off than that, so I'm going to ask you to introduce yourself and then we'll go from there.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY, COO AND CORPORATE SVP, BROADRIDGE FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.: Thank you very much. So Tim Gokey. I am the Chief Operating Officer of Broadridge, which means the business units report to me. I've been with Broadridge for 7 years. Prior to that, I was the President of the tax business at H&amp;R Block, and prior to that, I was with McKinsey &amp; Company in financial services for about 15 years.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: So I think before we sort of delve into the meat of the conversation, I think Broadridge, as I mentioned, is a name that's been around for a long period of time. What I would like to impose upon you to do is sort of give an overview of the businesses because I think there is -- there's a perception and truth, and sometimes, those often don't match up. And so if I can impose upon you to sort of walk through the portfolio of businesses that comprise the Broadridge platform today and then we could talk about some of the specific dynamics as it applies to those.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Absolutely. And just -- actually, going back to your introduction, so I said I've been with Broadridge 7 years. When I came here is really because I was thinking about the next phase of my career, and I looked at the company and the market positions and the assets that Broadridge had. I thought it was a fantastic growth platform, and that's definitely proved to be true over time. So let me just take a minute to talk about the company. We are a global fintech leader. We have about $4 billion in revenue, market cap just under $9 billion and a couple of major business franchise. And I'll come back and talk about those in a bit more detail, but really significant positions in a couple of areas that are attractive, large markets that are growing. We are -- our whole theme is around creating sustainable long-term growth for the company, really by investing in trends that we believe are aligned with financial services industry around mutualization, digitization, data and analytics. We'll come back and talk about those in more detail as well. We've really been investing behind organic growth, more sales to our existing and new clients, more products, mostly organic, but inorganic also. And we really -- the focus of our company is around what we call a service profit chain, which is really engaged associates delivering great outcomes for clients and that leading to very good long-term outcomes for shareholders. And so from a shareholder perspective, we think about delivering upper single-digit recurring fee revenue growth, leading to some operating leverage, low double-digit earnings growth, pay a dividend, do some share buybacks, be able to deliver sustainable low teens total returns to shareholders over long periods with low volatility NOI growth.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: At scale, too.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: If we could all do that, yes, that would be a great day.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: That's good. That's pretty good.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: All of that is predicated really on the core businesses, and there are -- we have 2 major reporting segments: Investor Communications, Global Technology and Operations. On the Communications side, the core of that business is a business that our CEO founded almost 30 years ago in regulatory communications. And the core activities there are working with broker-dealers to help them send to all of their clients the communications that all public companies and fund companies need to get to their clients around proxies, prospectuses, annual statements. And so it's a fairly boring set of stuff, and we are basically at the stage to become an industry utility for doing that. But because of that activity, we end up with a relationship with nearly every broker dealer, with a service relationship with every fund company, a service relationship with every public company, with every -- and investor, and we end up with every position of every investor in the U.S. and Canada in our data. And so that -- and we don't do anything with that, which we'll come back to as an opportunity, but that gives...</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Which begs the questions.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. It gives us a really privileged position in terms of working with those firms in terms of kinds of solutions that they need and how we can help them with other things. And so in that communications business, we built a series of other businesses around that. Customer Communications, where we're doing statements, confirmations, bills, a range of things and now that's beginning to go outside of financial services, serving advisers, serving companies on tax. So a range of things that are really providing a lot of organic growth, serving the fund industry. So those all really made that Communications business be a nice growth engine for us. That's the largest part of the company. The other side is Global Technology and Operations, and in that business, we provide technology platforms on a software-as-a-service basis, largely in cash securities, largely to the sell side, mostly back and middle office. We have 18 of 23 U.S. primary dealers are at our fixed income platform, 6 of the top 10 largest global institutions are on our equities platforms. And so we have a pretty ubiquitous position there in capital markets and wealth management as well. And because of the needs and trends around those firms looking at next-generation operations, that's provided a nice growth platform for us as well.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: So the -- ubiquitous is the term I was going to used, so you stole that term from me before I could use it. But given the footprint that you have and the points of connectivity that you have across-the-board and sort of touching third-party ecosystem, one of the constant concerns that you hear out there as it relates to either the financial institutions themselves or the technology providers, instead of financial institutions, is step function changes in the way people either receive, understand, consume communication. And you alluded to the communication part of your business and then, obviously, the technology piece. How do you think of the electronification of those dynamics and how that plays into Broadridge's wheelhouse, given that -- if you own all the points of contact, I imagine they kind of got to go through you somehow.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. No, it's a great question, and digitization has been one of the key things that we have been investing in. We view it as a -- obviously, one of the mega trends and a real potential opportunity for us. So we have been investing, really, for a long time in what I would call traditional digitization, and that's basically working on e-delivery. And we have the incentive structure that's been created between ourselves, our clients, their clients and the regulator to such that we're incented to do that and we save the industry, literally, billions now in the evolution from paper to digital delivery. And so at this stage on the regulatory side, just under half of the communications are digitized. At the same time, today's digital experience for delivery communications is terrible. You get an email, it has a link, you click on the link, it takes you to a website, you enter a password, if you can remember it, and you try to do that across all of your accounts and it's just -- it's not a good experience. So we believe, in the future, there's going to be a very different paradigm, that the important digital communications that people receive, they're really going to want to have a place to go, and it'll be different for different people, that's secure where, really, with one log on, they're able to get all the different things that they need. And we're not sure when or exactly how that's going to happen, but what we do know is it's very complicated for mailers, because if you don't exactly know where that's going to be and have to integrate with all these places, it's pretty expensive and concerning. So we're building, basically, the hub to have everyone integrate with us, and we can integrate with all those points of output and help the mailers within our platform project their brand into those points of communication. Starting with all the cloud drives, we're integrated to all of the cloud suites. We think that's a big channel. Online banking is an interesting channel. We're working with a lot of the big tech players as well. And we think that is something that over time will really change the way communications take place, and we think it'd be a good opportunity for us over time.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: No, understood. Understood, yes. So when you think about electronification, I think the next natural sort of segue is into -- as we talked about the way people consume data, it's being felt in a way that people actually invest their money, right? So we've seen this massive trend and movement away from the active portfolio to the passive portfolio, which has disrupted various parts of the ecosystem on the asset management side. How do you think about the impact of that type of behavior and how it applies to the prospects for Broadridge going forward? There's various terms, the uberification of financial services, whatever tag line that I'm not smart enough to invent - that you could apply there.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: As we think about the shift from active to passive and sort of the broader commoditization of asset management, we would say it's probably a mild positive for us, given how we're positioned. But let me just go in a bit deeper into that as to why. Think about the different sides of the business. On the Investor Communication side, really, the driver of the activity that we do on behalf of the industry is positions. So whether someone is in an active fund or a passive fund or in a mutual fund or an ETF or an underlying stock, it creates a position or a managed account, in which case it creates a lot of positions. And so even as we've seen a significant shift from active to passive, the number of positions has continued to go up and that has continued to drive modest, modest growth for us. The other side of the ledger is on the technology platform side. There, you can think about the wealth managers we serve and how their business model is evolving. I think they are finding new ways to make money. I think they're really focused on how they serve clients and sort of in the life events and things like that. So I think they'll be fine out of this. Then the other side is really asset management industry, and the asset management industry over the next 10 years will be going through all the pain that the sell side is going through the past 10 years. And that really causes people to rethink their business model, to rethink how can they take cost out of the ecosystem that naturally leads to conversations with technology players like ourselves in terms of how we can help them reengineer what they're doing to reduce costs. So we think, over time, that could be a positive for us.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: And I think that's a very important point to sort of focus on. This -- there's this cost intention that exist within fintech between the financial institution's desire to own the stack. We have to own it. It's ours. There's a lot of reasons why versus the realities of the world and the way the world's progressing and, frankly, cost controls and more tempered top lines. How do you sort of see that battle playing out, the in-source versus the outsource? Do you think you're kind of further along that? The value proposition is now so clear to your various counterparties that you're starting to pluck a way at sort of that nexus of costs that still remains in-sourced within these institutions. Or is there still more game to be played there?</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: I think it's always slower than you want it to be because of the cost of change in transition. But I think more than in any time in the past -- and this really gets of the whole theme of mutualization. And if you think -- at root, what Broadridge does is look for non-differentiating activities, hopefully, ones that are sort of yucky and at a big pain for our institution, for our clients and ones where no single institution can really invest enough to do it right. And if we can take over that activity and do it on behalf of multiple institutions, then we can put the right technology behind it, put the right process behind it. We can do it better. We can deliver them a better end product at much lower cost and still make a nice return for our shareholders. And so that's sort of thematically. I think because of the agencies of the global financial crisis, more firms have created a much sharper focus on what's truly differentiating for them. And so they're much more focused on putting their investment dollars on client experience, front end kinds of things and really saying there's a lot of stuff that truly -- they might have argued in the past were differentiating, but is really not. And so that has actually opened up a lot of territory for us.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: And is the dialogue that you're having is it you're identifying that spot where there's a pain point? Or do you have sort of a proactive outreach of institution that's saying \"I just -- I can't do this anymore, can you help me?\"</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: It is both. First of all, clearly, we have a lot of existing solutions where there -- for some reason, there's a client that inexplicably has not chosen -- not to do it with us yet. So there's always those conversations.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: So the ignorants, yes.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: And -- but when you think about new solutions, there are -- there's one we're working on right now that I won't go into because we're working on it, but this is in the wealth management where there's a -- basically, new regulation is going to cause a bunch of new reporting requirements. All of our wealth management clients have the same challenge. They're not exactly sure how they're going to solve it. And multiple, or independently, have come to us and said, \"Broadridge, could you figure out how to solve that for us?\" And those are the conversations we love to have.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: So let's take a step back away from sort of the Broadridge-centric, and let's take more of an industry perspective. When you sort of step back and think through -- whether it's securities or the capital markets technology stack or securities processing, obviously, there is the prospect of disruption of some sort. Blockchain is the one area that seems to be gaining further and further momentum. We see real investment dollars flow in, both from the VC world, but probably more importantly for you, from the financial institutions that look at this as being something there. They don't know quite what it is, but it's something. And so how has that sort of -- how are you thinking about -- the evolution of that? How do you ensure that you are sort of -- remain the tip of the spear as it relates to being the service provider and thought leader with your client base?</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. It's a great point. We are -- there's clearly something there.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: It's clear as I have no other way but to be great. Eloquent of me, right? Something's not good.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: And the question is what and when. But what we really say to our clients is we believe we can be the on-ramp for you to take advantage of whatever that is. When you think about blockchain and how it evolves, the biggest cost of all of that is not going to be creating that core thing that's blockchain, but integrating all the systems that exist in the client onto that thing and so if -- for clients that are part of our platform, that's going to all sort of come with it. So to make that happen, we are investing in lots of different ways. We are -- we're core investor in Digital Asset Holdings, so one of the startups that we talked to -- we talked to all the startups. We have a -- we made some investments. We bought some technology from a company called Inveshare in the proxy space that we think will help us. We have a core team that is working on -- alongside clients, typically, on a series of use cases where we think there's the most promise in the areas that really touch the ecosystem where we're the logical players. So for instance, we just did a proof-of-concept with JPMorgan and Northern Trust and Santander in global proxy. We are working with TTCC in repos. So with 6 different use cases going and really by becoming knowledgeable, working on Hyperledger, on Ethereum, on Quorum, all the different technologies, have those covered, doing use cases on each of those. That's the way we think we'll be in the best position to help our clients figure out how to best leverage those technologies in the areas that are relevant for us.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Understood. So sticking with some of the macro dynamics, we've been blessed with a relatively strong equity markets for pretty close to a decade. One of the questions that does come up when you talk about the broader fintech ecosystem, especially an enterprise that is somewhat levered to the capital markets and the velocity of the capital markets, how do you think about the prospects of either a downturn or correction? What are some of the sort of the levers that a company, such as yourself, can pull to sort of insulate yourself from the esoteric factors -- the external factors that have a direct bearing on either your company itself or your underlying client base?</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. It's -- I think we have to assume that there will be a significant downturn sometime in the next few years. We -- by the nature of what we do, we're fairly resilient to that. No one is immune to it. But when you think about -- so let's say -- think about the Communications piece. The biggest part of that business, the driver of our revenues, again, is positions. Positions -- when people are happier, they do invest in more stuff. And when they're less happy, they invest in less stuff. But it's pretty, pretty slow. So in the midst of the global financial crisis, if you look at stock record growth, it was minus 1%. So it wasn't positive. So let's say -- it's -- in a good year, it's been as high as -- at a plus 5%, but it's not dramatically down. It just sort of stops growing. And even through the crisis, the mutual fund positions continue to grow. So the Communications business is pretty robust after that. On the Global Technology and Operations side, most of our fees are not directly responsive to trades. They're mostly more \"fee-for-service.\" There is some leverage there. About 30% of the revenues are levered against trades, and they're -- volatility creates more trades. Lack of volatility creates fewer. So if you have a market correction, you can go either way.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Okay. M&amp;A, so it's been a tool that you've managed to wield quite effectively. Vince, I'll pick on -- Vince. He's here. He's a discriminating buyer. So he's selective in his deployment of capital. Is that something that you foresee as a continued sort of avenue to accelerate growth across the organic initiatives? And how do you think about the deployment of capital between your 2 main divisions?</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. Well, I think -- we think of M&amp;A as a sort of a make or buy decision, and we're pretty disciplined around capital deployment generally. So I think you know, but just for everyone, we're fairly capital-light company in terms of the amount of CapEx that it takes to sustain our core business. That gives us free cash flow that is, I think, right around the same as net income, maybe a little better even sometimes. And we deploy -- we pay a dividend. We invest in our core business. Those are first 2 priorities. We have done selective tuck-in M&amp;A, which I'll come back to, and we do share buybacks. As we said, we're pretty disciplined around that, and that's a core part of the thesis. On the M&amp;A side, we really look at this through our clients' lens and where can we -- what do they need. We're a natural person that can add value to that. If you think about fintech, it's sort of an evergreen place for tuck-in M&amp;A because there's always change. There always new teams going out and creating something, and they get it to $10 million, $20 million in revenue. And 10 other teams have failed to get it that far. And we can partner with those folks, and we think about this almost as recruiting, and really helping an entrepreneur to realize their vision about how to become significant in the industry. Because when you get to, say, $10 million of revenue and now you want to sell that solution to RBC, RBC is probably not going to buy it from them. But they will buy it from us. And it's not about cost. A lot of people, when they're talking about M&amp;A is how much cost can take out of the target. In our case, it's usually there are servers in the closet some place, and we're going to put in a Tier 4 data center. And so it's how much more is it going to cost to really industrialize it and bring it to our clients in the way that they want to.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Cost guys (inaudible), those are the payments guys. Let's stay away from them.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Exactly. So we've had -- have had good success, and we track all the returns, and I'd say our unlevered IRRs are very, very good. But more important than that is the value that it's brought to our clients. And by making that our ecosystem that much stronger, it really improves our client value proposition as well.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Last question, and it's not on this page and it's not a controversial one, so this should be easy one. What are you most proud of about Broadridge? And what do you think is the one fact that you wish people understood about Broadridge but don't? So that's 2 questions actually.</p><p>TIMOTHY C. GOKEY: Yes. I think the Broadridge growth for a long time was predicated on -- and with the business that our CEO, Rich Daly, built predicated on being a disruptor and really bringing something that's really new to the industry. And when that thing, the regulatory communications that has really got to scale, I think there was a period there where we have really great client relationships. We really take a very long-term view of how we work with clients. We're viewed as very fair. People like doing business with us. But we became viewed as sort of a bit of legacy company without a lot of new solutions. And so I think the thing that I'm both most proud of and that I would want -- really want people to know is how we have really changed over the past 7 years, become more of a technology company, really reengineering our core platforms, bringing in new solutions, really being much more forward-thinking in partnership with our clients to really help map out with them where the industry is going to and be able to be a better partner industry to them really -- that even than we are in the current.</p><p>JASON GURANDIANO: Understood. I'm supposed to be impartial, but I'm a big fan of Broadridge. So thank you very much for your time. It was great.</p><p>TIMOTHY C.

He got over the decision-making challenge of what to wear by donning precisely the same style of grey T-shirt every single day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His reasoning is simple, somewhat reassuring to his supporters and yet breathtakingly arrogant: \"I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community... I'm in this really lucky position, where I get to wake up every day and help serve more than a billion people. And I feel like I'm not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He said this in 2014 when Facebook as a company was arguably at its peak: massive growth in audience and revenue numbers, especially on mobile phones; ubiquitous; popular; a largely uncritical public and media perception; everyone clamouring to be a friend of The Zuck.</p><p>But what he said about his one-style-fits-all clothing and need to serve a grateful billion people reveals a lot about how Silicon Valley's giant companies operate, with a dangerous mixture of idealism, naivety, arrogance and leadership that borders on dictatorship. It is this that has created just the conditions for the hot water in which Facebook now find themselves, amid a swirl of allegations over the harvesting and use of personal data from its users by political consultants Cambridge Analytica - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election or the Brexit referendum.</p><p>Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing, but with the social network's share price on the slide and Zuckerberg facing calls to testify before the US Congress about how his firm will protect users, this does seem to be a moment of reckoning for the company, and a warning for the rest of the \"Big Five\" tech firms - Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. Their weaknesses have long been apparent, even if they are not always clear to all those working on the inside. I worked at Microsoft for 18 largely happy years, from 1996 to 2014, and have deep knowledge of how seemingly-brilliantly run companies can walk into the type of nightmare scenario now unfolding for Facebook from the Cambridge Analytica allegations.</p><p>Facebook's 2014 uncritical peak highlights the most dangerous moment for that handful of giant technology platform companies, who have such a massive influence on everything that happens in the western world (China has its own versions of these firms), when optimism is unchecked, and self-questioning is overlooked. When Zuckerberg talked complacently about \"serving\" more than one billion people, there is little indication he understood how the platform he had created - where all those people share data and information - would spew up the sort of challenges that are now bearing down on his company like an army of Irish front row forwards.</p><p>Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are great companies. They have changed the world, mostly in a good way. But there are common characteristics in their make-up which mean that there are times when they are inevitably blind to what is really going on out in a cyberworld that is largely unpoliced and populated by very many bad guys.</p><p>It is up to the authorities to conclude whether Cambridge Analytica are among the 'bad guys', but what is already clear is that their problems are also Facebook's problems. The Californian firm is finding out what happens when it remains blind to - or uninterested in - what else is going on out there.</p><p>The Silicon Valley giants have each been led by undoubted geniuses - Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos - men who retained an iron rule and microscopic control over their companies even as they became too large for one or two people to understand all the details of what could go wrong. The fact that Zuckerberg's personal 2018 resolution is to \"fix\" Facebook's problems demonstrates that the company allowed too many issues to go unchecked - but that he still sees himself as the individual to resolve them.</p><p>Until they are forced to grow up, all of the West Coast mega-platforms are undermined by an inherent culture of wide-eyed idealism that fails to see the dangers hidden in the very products they are successfully creating.</p><p>I have a number of very good friends who work for Facebook. Some previously worked at Microsoft, Google and other big tech firms. Not surprisingly there is a merry-go-round of job-swapping around those firms and a recruitment war to bring the best ones on board from their rivals. All of them have an evangelical zeal at the heart of their culture that ensures employees are totally committed to the cause. They believe.</p><p>Facebook's mission statement, until 2017, was \"to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected\". It is now, to \"give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together\". They are classic platform mission statements supported wholeheartedly and uncritically by everyone who works there.</p><p>But the original left the company vulnerable. If part of Zuckerberg's goal is to make the world open and connected, if he and his software engineers build a platform that can do just that, then there should be no surprise that politicians, criminals, intelligence agencies, the military, marketers and many others will want to use that openness for their own agenda. Even now that some of those darker consequences are becoming clearer, the evangelical belief of the Facebook zealots is unshakable. The idea that being open and connected is the right thing - end of story - is bought into totally at the company's Menlo Park campus, in California, and its offices around the world. And it leads to an arrogance that is inherent in Zuckerberg's belief that he wakes every morning to serve a billion people - and spreads around the company.</p><p>Two years ago, prior to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, I spent quite a lot of time discussing with Facebook people and other observers about how the firm should work with media partners, and the dangers of the company's laid back, tunnel-visioned 'dive into our platform, the water's warm' approach. Emily Bell, the former <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis> journalist and now an academic at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, was presciently warning that \"Facebook is eating the world\", but the people inside the company didn't care and were utterly unworried as they marched forward into a world of 'fake news' and 'echo chambers.' The revenue was rolling in with more than 80% of mobile ad revenue coming to Facebook and Google, so why worry?</p><p>One reason for this apparent nonchalance, apart from the naivety and arrogance, is the way Facebook likes to self-identify as just a 'platform'. This is what every tech firm wants to be. It means your software is the basis for other companies and consumers to come and create whatever they want. The platform companies aim to lock you in to their platform, so that you use their services and no-one else's. It is why they all have their own operating system, browser, communication services, music and content services and hardware such as phones and Alexa-type devices. Every little piece that you do on that company's platform locks you in a bit more. It is why most people are either Apple iPhone users or Google Android owners: once you are in, it is very hard to get out. One of the problems with the 'we are just a platform' argument is that it allows companies to absolve responsibility from the bad stuff that is going on.</p><p>A newspaper is not a platform. It publishes what its editors believe are the right things to publish for their audience. Those editors are legally accountable for that content. The tech platforms are desperately trying to argue that they are not publishers but platforms; that what other people publish or do on their platform is nothing to do with them. It is exactly this attitude that allowed 'fake news' to establish itself.</p><p>It is like saying that if you are a phone company and two crooks discuss a bank raid over the phone, that is nothing to do with you. We had a classic and difficult platform issue in the early 2000s at Microsoft's MSN. This was relatively early in the history of the internet and we had chatroom technology that was fun, interesting, a bit scary and mostly unpoliced. In the UK, we started to get a lot of heat about how paedophiles were going into these chatrooms to groom children.</p><p>The official line was that we were a platform, and that the problem was nothing to do with us. The bosses in the US were not very interested. They didn't see it as a big issue... \"We are just the platform\".</p><p>I am glad to say that we took a stand with our leadership in Redmond, Washington State, and got them to agree that we could close down those chatrooms in 2003. We made the right decision, recognising that we were <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> just a platform and had a responsibility to do the right thing. I don't see Facebook yet fully recognising that they have to take responsibility for their own platform.</p><p>That internal Microsoft dispute over chatrooms also indicates another of the challenges for these global tech giants: those that arise when the technology is built centrally and distributed to local teams. It is a fantastic economically-brilliant model: essentially, one size fits all around the globe. Just see how Amazon's global platform is essentially destroying High Streets, shopping malls and retail chains across continents.</p><p>At MSN, we always had local editorial teams who had full oversight as to what was being published in each market: a local versus global balance that meant that we could ensure local sensibilities were taken into account. Facebook doesn't appear to have this to the same extent. They have local sales and marketing teams, but in other areas the company can appear very clumsy. One high profile example came in 2016, when Facebook demonstrated a lack of local understanding in its mishandling of the publication, in Norway, of the iconic 1972 photograph showing a naked Vietnamese girl running along a road after a napalm attack. Facebook initially removed the image, saying it violated its community standards barring child nudity. The incident even led to the Norwegian prime minister having a post deleted.</p><p>Such an impersonal intervention also hints at another problem for Facebook and others - the subjugating of common sense to the power of technology. The top software engineers are not only utterly brilliant people. They believe utterly in technology and the power that it brings. They believe that Artificial Intelligence will bring only good. They may say that they are concerned at the effects that AI will bring, but they will push on regardless. I had a brilliant genius of a boss at Microsoft who believed that we would be able to replace all journalists and editors with algorithms in due course. He has moved on now, but the process is continuing.</p><p>If tech firms involve humans in their process they not only create expenses, but also throw up other problems for the companies that it would be simpler to avoid. Such sites use technology to identify naked skin in pictures. At Microsoft, back in the day, we had a team in the Philippines to then check if the image was decent or not. The law and regulations were basically on the basis of 'notice and take down'. If you were alerted to bad content, then you should take it down. If you didn't notice, then it wasn't your issue. These are classic platform rules. Once again, we had issues with potential paedophile content. The lawyers told us that we couldn't mount our own campaign to 'notice' the content actively. If we did, then we could be liable. We went covert. We found bad content. We got rid of it. We alerted authorities when we needed to. We didn't tell anyone what we were doing. It was common sense. And the technology was not in charge.</p><p>Another weakness that these companies have is their very size. One of the fascinations about working for the Big Five is that the job you do has impact on millions and millions of people. The attractions of working at these places are well documented and all true: you are well compensated in terms of salary and stock grants; the kitchens have free food, Diet Coke, fruit and chocolate; many have gyms and fitness areas; it is fine to work from home regularly. But it is also seductive to be working on products that are used by millions of people. I remember introducing my then 14-year-old son to a mate from Facebook. He was instantly a total fanboy. But for those lucky men and women who fill those jobs there is a danger they get so wrapped up in the kudos of their role, making more and more money, hitting their key performance indicators and growing around the world, that they forget how it can go wrong. And that when it goes wrong, it affects so many people, can change governments, force companies out of business, result in young children being abused online. Not enough people in these organisations are focused on ensuring the bad stuff doesn't happen.</p><p>Many people will have read Dave Eggers' <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Circle</emphasis> or seen the movie, starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. It shows the platform company as a cult, where the core is rotten and the staff are believers. It looked very far-fetched but really it isn't. I don't believe the core of Facebook, or Microsoft or the others are rotten, although I never bought Google's claim to Do No Evil. But as the Cambridge Analytica scandal shows - and the fake news problems of the past few years have exposed - there is a vulnerability at the heart of these firms that they seem unable to fix themselves, because they are simply unable to see it.</p><p>Microsoft changed radically when faced with break-up action from the Department of Justice and the EU regulators, around the turn of the millenium. It is hard to describe just how much of a wake-up call that was for everyone in the organisation everywhere. It was a near-death experience that, I believe, made it a much better and more responsible company.</p><p>It feels like Facebook is now edging closer to that scenario itself.

The blue-chip proxy overcame an early decline to as low as 9178.60 but closed off its intraday high of 9245.54.\u00a0</p><p>IBM (IBM:NYSE) and J.P. Morgan (JPM:NYSE) were the strongest Dow components, the latter evincing the strong overall session for financial stocks. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Bank Index slid 0.2% but the American Stock Exchange Broker/Dealer Index gained 2.5%.\u00a0</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose as high as 1229.72 but saw its string of record-setting closes ended at three, falling 2.27, or 0.2%, to 1226.27.\u00a0</p><p>Hamstrung by weakness in big tech names such as Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), the Nasdaq Composite Indexalso fell from historic heights, shedding 9.50, or 0.4%, to 2163.04.\u00a0</p><p>The Russell 2000 managed to rise 0.78, or 0.2%, to 405.57.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's not a helluva lot going on,\" said Jim Volk, co-head of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson in Portland, Ore. \"The [Dow] is up but quietly rallying before Christmas. The market is seasonally strong except for the little down drift a few days ago.\"\u00a0</p><p>Volk said he expects more quietude in the coming week but with the positive drift continuing. \"It looks like people want to the market to continue to rally into the end of the year,\" he said. \"But my sense is most major accounts are done for the year, especially the big hedge funds.\"\u00a0</p><p>In New York Stock Exchange trading, 249.6 million shares were traded while advancers bested declining stocks 1,471 to 1,298. In Nasdaq Stock Market activity, 447 million shares were exchanged while gainers led 1,983 to 1,738. New 52-week highs bested new lows 95 to 28 on the Big Board and by 75 to 45 in over-the-counter trading.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Internet Madness Takes No Holiday\u00a0</p><p>Micron Technology (MU:NYSE) was a highlight among traditional tech names, falling 3.2% despite late yesterday posting a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss. But Micron was up 22% since Dec.1 heading into today, double the gain of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, so some retrenchment was due.\u00a0</p><p>While the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.7%, TheStreet.com Internet Sector index rose 0.4%. Gains by Infoseek (SEEK:Nasdaq) and @Home (ATHM:Nasdaq) led the index but much of the excitement today in secondary and tertiary names.\u00a0 </p><p>Delia's (DLIA:Nasdaq) climbed 67% after announcing it will expand its online offerings to include a store at Yahoo!'s (YHOO:Nasdaq) shopping site.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, CVF Technologies (CNV:NYSE) rose 43% after announcing it will begin selling its herbal and nutritional products online. Also notably higher on even the hint of online developments were PC Connection (PCCC:Nasdaq), higher by 65%; SkyMall (SKYM:Nasdaq), which gained 110%; and Internet America (GEEK:Nasdaq), up a further 42%.\u00a0</p><p>On the flip side, Multiple Zones (MZON:Nasdaq) slid 47% and uBid (UBID:Nasdaq) shed 35%; both enjoyed big gains yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>\"Anybody who would argue the Internet stocks are not in the midst of a speculative bubble is blind,\" Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in an interview earlier this week. \"It's the biggest speculative bubble of our lifetime. A moose bubble.\"\u00a0</p><p>Bernstein is not convinced (as are others) the action in Net stocks portends a disaster for the market as a whole. \"You can make a doomsday scenario out of anything, but there have been speculative bubbles of smaller proportions that have not affected the broader market,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Nonetheless, the quant maven said what is going on in Netland is \"mind-boggling\" and believes (as do most) that it will end badly. \"All that has to happen is Wal-Mart (WMT:NYSE) decides to open a Web site and it's all over for most retailers on the Web,\" he said. \"Yes, there is the psyche of the Net community but ultimately is comes down to who has the best price. When it comes to commodity distribution, nobody does it better than Wal-Mart and they can undercut everybody because of existing agreements. With that lurking out there, it amazes me what's going on.\"\u00a0</p><p>At least we're not alone.\u00a0</p><p>Among other indices, the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 10.15, or 0.3%, to 3044.08; the Dow Jones Utility Average lost 0.51, or 0.2%, to 314.54; and the American Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 1.71, or 0.3%, to 666.49.\u00a0</p><p>For the week, the Dow industrials rose 314.36, or 3.5%; the S&amp;P 500 gained 40.24, or 3.4%; the Nasdaq Comp rose 78.90, or 3.8%; the Russell 2000 added 8.15, or 2.1%; TheStreet.com Internet Index gained 52.06, or 13.8%; the Dow transports rose 35.04, or 1.2%; the Dow utilities added 1.25, or 0.4%; and the Amex Composite climbed 15.24, or 2.3%.\u00a0</p><p>The 30-year Treasury bond, in which trading closed at 2 p.m. EST, was down 19/32 to 100 15/32, its yield rising to 5.22%.\u00a0</p><p>Elsewhere in North American equities today, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 advanced 18.41 to 6465.40 and the Mexican Stock Exchange IPC Index leapt 71.06, or 1.8%, to 4001.35. For the week, the TSE 300 rose 112.08, or 1.8%, and the IPC gained 160.11, or 4.2%.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Thursday's Company Report\u00a0</p><p>By Heather Moore<br/>Staff Reporter\u00a0</p><p>(Earnings estimates from First Call; new highs and lows on a closing basis unless otherwise specified.

Just say something Weblike and you're good to go. Playboy (PLA:NYSE) took in 2, or 10.2%, to an all-time high of 21 5/8 on market chatter about a possible offering of the company's Internet unit even after Playboy executives said the company has no current plans for such a move.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* SkyMall vaulted 6 5/8, or 110%, to an all-time high of 12 9/16 after the company's Web potential was discussed on the Internet.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* Zapata (ZAP:NYSE) lost 1 7/8, or 13.2%, to 12 3/8 after yesterday's spike upward on news of the company's revived plans to open an Internet business.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* Ziff-Davis (ZD:NYSE) jumped 4 7/8, or 30.7%, to an all-time high of 20 3/4 after Tuesday saying it filed with regulators for an IPO for its ZDNet Internet business.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* Among those soaring for no reason other than being privileged enough to somehow be connected to the Internet were: PC Connection, an online software and computer products retailer, which hopped 8 3/4, or 64.8%, to 22 1/4; Internet America, an Internet service provider, which hopped 12 15/16, or 41.6%, to an all-time high of 44; Egghead.com (EGGS:Nasdaq), which hopped 1 1/16 to 23 3/4; and @Home, which hopped 9 1/16, or 12.6%, to an all-time high of 80 7/8. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures\u00a0</p><p>Aames Financial (AAM:NYSE) added 1/16 to 2 9/16 after last night saying Capital Z Financial Services Fund agreed to make an equity investment of up to $100 million in the company.\u00a0</p><p>Adelphia Communications (ADLAC:Nasdaq) lifted 2 1/8, or 5%, to an all-time high of 44 1/2 after yesterday agreeing to buy Verto Communications and merge the company into a subsidiary.\u00a0</p><p>Borders (BGP:NYSE) scored 2 3/16, or 10.4%, to 23 3/16 after the Federal Trade Commission announced yesterday it's seeking more information on Borders competitor Barnes &amp; Noble's (BKS:NYSE) $600 million proposed acquisition of book distributor Ingram Book Group. Barnes &amp; Noble rose 1 1/16 to 35 1/2.\u00a0</p><p>Ford (F:NYSE) took in 1/2 to 58 7/8 on word from ING Baring Securities the automaker sold its 9% stake in South Korea's Kia Motors to J.P.

Chevron shed 5/16 to 84 11/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Earnings/revenue reports and previews\u00a0</p><p>Community First Bankshares (CFBX:Nasdaq) lowered 13/16 to 20 1/8 after saying late yesterday it will take a fourth-quarter charge of $10 million, or 14 cents a share, on the liquidation of its subprime lending units.\u00a0</p><p>Micron Technology fell 1 3/4 to 52 1/4 after the chip maker late yesterday announced a first-quarter loss of 19 cents a share vs. the year-ago profit of 3 cents. The loss did beat estimates for a loss of 28 cents. Today, Credit Suisse First Boston upped its 1999 estimates on Micron and raised the stock's price target to 70 from 65 a share.\u00a0</p><p>Northwest Natural Gas (NWNG:Nasdaq), a Portland, Ore.-based utility, tumbled 1 3/16 to 26 5/8 after warning its fourth-quarter profit will be 2 cents below the four-analyst view of 79 cents.

AND ANDREW H. TISCH DISTINGUISHED VISITING FELLOW CAMERON F. KERRY </p><p>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE VISITING SCHOLAR ROSLYN LAYTON </p><p>OFFICE OF SENATOR EDWARD J. MARKEY (D-MA) SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR JOSEPH WENDER </p><p>[*]TURNER LEE: We'll ask everybody to start to get settled because we are webcasting and to our webcasting audience, we will be starting in just a couple of seconds. </p><p>All righty, hello everybody. Good morning. I go to a black Baptist church and when the pastor says good morning, everybody says good morning, okay? So, we're going to act like we're in my church. </p><p>Good morning, everybody! </p><p>UNKNOWN: Good morning. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Okay, I knew you had enough coffee, it's almost eleven o'clock, okay. </p><p>My name is Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, I'm a Fellow in the Center for Technology Innovation and I'm excited to be hosting this panel. </p><p>It's always difficult as we get to the end of the decade to have a significant conversation, but we thought it was really well worth having this discussion because we're sort of in the sandwich period when it comes to privacy. </p><p>Let me tell you what the sandwich is. A little over a year ago we had something called the General Data Protection Regulation come through the EU that pretty much changed the nature of what privacy looked like. </p><p>That came in a perfect storm of Cambridge Analytica as well as other privacy infractions that had been mounting in terms of our credit and other institutions and then leading into January we'll have the California Consumer Privacy Act, the CCPA which will be the other part of the sandwich. </p><p>And in between that sandwich has been a lot of discussions and a few bills that are sort of making up the lettuce around privacy, and that would be the Wicker and Cantwell bills if you have not already seen them. </p><p>So, we thought, and I'm saying we as I'm referring to my dear friend and colleague Cam Kerry who has been working really hard on this series called the Privacy Debates. If you have not looked at it, I encourage you to go to the Brookings website and read some recent pieces that he's put together. </p><p>We thought this would be a really timely conversation because as these two parts of the bread have basically framed this dialogue on what data collection, use and sharing look like. </p><p>Where are we going to take some cues of that, leading towards national federal privacy framework, or will we diverge, right? Or will there be parts of it that will actually not be relevant to the discussion. </p><p>So, today's dialogue, I'm joined by some additional friends and I think some really important experts who are taking a look at these issues. </p><p>I will introduce them in just a moment, but I want to make sure you are all in the right place and affirm that you are in the right place in this particular dialogue. </p><p>So, we're actually going to start with the discussion and after we start with the discussion, we will actually lend itself to about ten minutes of Q&amp;A.  </p><p>A couple of other housekeeping notes, please Tweet any activity under what's called the privacy debate hashtag and we also have left on your seats an evaluation form. If you find this conversation informative and something useful, I ask you actually fill that out on your way out. Give it to one of our staff who will collect that. </p><p>So, thanks again for being here. </p><p>Today I'm joined by experts in this field who have actually dealt with this conversation and I'll start with my colleague Cam Kerry who is a fellow here at Brookings. Joey Wender who is in the office of Senator Ed Markey, Roslyn Layton who comes from next door from the American Enterprise Institute and Jeff Brueggeman who is at AT&amp;T. </p><p>For disclosure purposes, AT&amp;T is a donor here at Brookings. </p><p>With that, let's give them all a round of applause. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>So, I want to jump right into this debate and Joey, I'm going to start with you, not like you all have anything else to talk about up on Capitol Hill. </p><p>So much has happened in the past 18 months and this has been a dialogue that's had starts and stops and we now have seen privacy bills come from both sides which is promising due to the bi-partisan nature. We've had multiple hearings on this as late as last week on it. </p><p>So what I'd like to talk to you about is just this conversation about privacy legislation and get this peek from you as somebody who sits on the Hill to where we were and where we're going general in the United States before we delve into the influences of, I like my metaphor of the sandwich. I'm sticking with it Joey, just telling you right now, okay? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WENDER: Well I'm hungry so-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, thank you. I would say we've gone from a world--so three things have happened, right? GDPR, the California law and Cambridge Analytica, I would say those are the three drivers that have changed the course of this conversation over the last couple of years. </p><p>So, we've gone from a world of if we were going to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation to when are we going to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation. </p><p>That's the first shift. The second shift that we've seen in the last couple of years because of these three intervening events, is what is the scope of what that bill looks like? </p><p>A few years ago, it would have been a more simple notice and choice regime. People should have noticed their information has been collected or shared or used and they should have the right to say no to collection, sharing, use, sale, etcetera. </p><p>That debate has clearly shifted over the last few years and not only folks on the Hill and advocates, but also industry has recognized that notice and choice is simply not enough for giving consumers rights over their information. </p><p>Now we're having a conversation about use limitations, that there are certain things that are always going to be off the table whether they be discriminatory uses or what do we do with people's biometric information? What data minimization requirements we put in place as in you can't, you know collect that information in the first place. </p><p>So, it's both this if to when shift and what is the scope of what this likely bill will eventually look like, shifted pretty dramatically in the last couple of years. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Okay, I want to jump over to you then because as Joey's talking about we're actually seeing, I think in some of the new bills, the bill from Senator Cantwell and Senator Wicker, that actually is starting to look at some of those things. </p><p>What I'm particularly interested in, since this conversation is about GDPR and CCPA, the extent to which we are actually seeing these new bills, maybe talk about what these new bills are, for people who may not know. But if they are in any way influenced by either, on either side. </p><p>KERRY: Thanks, and I'd move to strike the last word. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, you know they are as Joey said, they are certainly regular drivers of this legislation, but they are also benchmarks. So, we are dealing with first I think a set of expectations, that has been created by GDPR and more significantly by the CCPA. </p><p>So, as GDPR has been implemented, we've seen, you  know, many companies that are subject to it's very broad territorial reach, adapt their privacy programs to the GDPR, so lots of companies in some cases like Microsoft is one example, have said we're going to apply GDPR to all of our services as really a positioning statement and for others it was just a much easier compliance. Might have said look, we're just going to have one program around the world and so now lots of Americans are subject to GDPR, then along comes CCPA which applies to the seventh largest economy in the world and really sets a standard that affects services across the United States. </p><p>On top of which, one quarter of the congressional delegation in the--of the democratic delegation in the house is from California, including the Speaker, including a number of other very influential members of congress who are saying, we are not going to let the federal government roll back protections that our citizens have. So, any bill is going to match up to CCPA. </p><p>So, that has really set a benchmark and we are seeing the adoption of almost I think is a given in legislation, individual rights of access of correction, deletion of data and portability of data that mirror both GDPR and CCPA.  </p><p>The draft legislation, both the Wicker bills and the Cantwell bills go I think significantly beyond CCPA in terms of what Joey talked about, limitations on collection. On use and broader sharing limitations than CCPA and you know not exactly like GDPR but conceptually the same--the same principals. I think looking to have something that is not as prescriptive as GDPR is, not as process oriented but in some respects also goes beyond GDPR. What we're seeing, certainly very explicitly, in the Cantwell and others draft is provisions against the use of personal information in ways that--that are discriminatory. </p><p>That goes beyond GDPR and we're not as explicitly but certainly been an opening the door to discrimination issues in the Wicker bill as well. </p><p>You know this is a great start. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah, before we go to Ros on compliance, I want to go back to the two of you for just a second and I want to be mindful of folks who have followed this debate closely and some who are just getting their feet wet in this debate. </p><p>Look at GDPR, this is an oversimplification I'm going to make and please correct me if I'm wrong.  </p><p>I like what Cam said, right? This was about a process, a submission of processes around data use, data collection, data sharing. </p><p>GDPR--I mean CCPA seems to be something that's around enforcement, right? </p><p>And a much more granular look at what's on and off limits and how do we actually enforce that. </p><p>Would that be, can you give for the audience maybe a high-level view of what both categories, what each is trying to accomplish before we delve into compliance? </p><p>KERRY: Is that back to me? </p><p>TURNER LEE: Between the two of you. </p><p>KERRY: Well, CCPA is, you know as I see it first and foremost about providing more individual control and so it is those individual rights and you know it is a right to opt out of the sharing of your data but in some respects that is sort of doubling down on the problem that we have today. </p><p>Joe talked about the failures of notice and choice. The problem that we have with privacy today is that it really puts all of the burden on us as individuals, as consumers to protect our privacy and so what we are seeing is a, in GDPR, in both the Wicker and Cantwell bills, is a move towards putting more of the obligations on the companies that collect the data to manage that data, to handle that data, to process that data in ways that are consistent with our expectations, you know when we share the data. </p><p>WENDER: The only thing I would, I mean I agree with everything you said. The only thing I would add is that there is more and more of a recognition that there is an asymmetrical relationship in terms of power between consumers and these large companies.  </p><p>That consumers, you can give them all the rights in the world, they don't really understand what these large companies are doing with their information, how ads and other services are being served to them and so that's why a lot of this conversation is being shifted to what affirmative obligations are we putting on these companies to help protect consumers. </p><p>Because an individual consumer, it's just simply not enough to give somebody a four-thousand-word privacy policy and say okay, read this, okay cool you've read it now you've consented to it, it's over. </p><p>Right, that's clearly just not enough in 2019 and the only thing I would add is it's not only just asymmetrical power relationship, it's that these companies themselves have become so much more powerful and so much pervasive in our society and they control so many aspects of our life. </p><p>So, it's not as simple as just oh, you're handing over your information to a store because you're buying a service. I mean we're on a whole other level where there is a, we can talk about opaqueness of algorithms.  </p><p>There's a whole world in which people are being served news and products and services that you don't understand at all how that happened and so because of how powerful these entities have become in our society, it's incumbent on us to put more obligations on them in order to level the playing field between the consumer and the company. </p><p>KERRY: Some of these companies-- </p><p>WENDER: You know listen, I will say this, one last thing I'll say is that's what makes this conversation so difficult is that Google, let's just say the words, Google and Facebook become--become the examples right, that everybody uses for the internet or for these companies. </p><p>But the truth is Google is not like Facebook, Facebook is not like Google and Google and Facebook are unlike the millions of other online companies. </p><p>So, the rules we put in place can't be for Google and Facebook. We have to do it in a way that recognizes there is a huge diversity of services and websites out there and frankly that's what makes a lot of this so challenging. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Well that's a nice shift, Roslyn, to you right? Because if the and thank you both for sort of answering that question because I think it's inherent to this conversation. </p><p>If there's a shift towards companies then there'll be a shift towards compliance, right? And I was picking up my great research assistant, Kaitlyn Chin (SP) helped me find a stat that I want to share with the group from the International Association of Privacy Professionals at Ernst and Young who estimated that Fortune 500 companies spend $8 billion on GDPR compliance and it's anticipated with CCPA compliance that their looking at about $55 billion.  </p><p>So those are huge compliance costs, particularly you know, if we're shifting that burden to companies. </p><p>So, Roslyn, I'd like to find out from you, you know are these real and actualized costs? Are they areas that we should be paying attention to as we shift the regulatory burden? And you know, what impact does that have then on us you know, really creating a benchmark for privacy? </p><p>LAYTON: So, Nicol, first I want to start by saying thank you for this invitation and also to Cam and great to meet my new friend here, Joe and Jeff and just to say, I'm next door at AEI. </p><p>We've worked together, Brookings and AI for so many years, we like you so much we moved our office to be next to you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TURNER LEE: I know that was kind of like, huh. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LAYTON: So, but I'm going to make some remarks today that are going to reflect my views.  </p><p>AEI doesn't have a view on privacy itself and to keep with our idea about the sandwich, you know as a researcher, what I'm looking at is what's in the sandwich. </p><p>Is it made with Wonder Bread? Is it whole grain bread? You've got avocado in there. Is it a vegetarian sandwich? So, I'm actually interested in what is in the sandwich and when I look at you know. </p><p>And I also, I live most of the year in Copenhagen, I work at the university in Denmark at Aalborg University and my research is published there. </p><p>Where I'm looking at the outcome of the GDPR, 18 months after it's been in place and I'm comparing now what we have as CCPA and so I look at the differences of these two laws, for me it's about the numbers. I mean GDPR has 45 specific regulations around what the company has to do. CCPA has 77 so it's even more stringent and the challenge for me is there is a law put together in less than a month, no testing around the provisions that were adopted. </p><p>The folks who did this, they just made it up and said let's put an 800 number on the website. I mean they just pulled these things together. There's no testing associated with it. </p><p>But the early kind of data we have in terms of companies having to get ready for this is that it is between $1 million and--minimum and $100,000 to comply and $1 million and you know maybe in Europe it's been $9 to $10 billion for GDPR. </p><p>The CCPA is even more than that. We're talking on order of $55 billion, $70 billion. That's two percent of the GDP of California and the California Department of Justice itself has published a cost benefit analysis which is giving 14 to one cost over benefits. </p><p>Meaning that the cost to set this up, $55 billion initially, another $16 over ten to 15 years, compared to only $5 billion of documented benefit. So, that's not a great return on investment. </p><p>The other challenge there is that the 99 percent of the companies in California have less than 500 employees so $100,000 is more than the entire cost that a typical company spends on their entire IT system.  </p><p>So, this is going to be extremely challenging for small, medium size companies and the other part that we've seen already with GDPR which I think policy makers need to wake up quickly is that it has been the reward for the largest companies. </p><p>We've seen in 18 months that Google, Facebook, Amazon they have increased their market share on European Union, they have increased their revenue. In fact, users continue to go to those platforms to the detriment to their competitors who have lost market share. They have lost the ability to track venture capital and we don't see small and medium sized companies growing. </p><p>So, if you look at the United States, we had 40,000 start ups last year. Still a wonderful place to innovate. Things are going great. I'm really concerned about we're going to kill the golden goose that laid this golden egg. </p><p>And if I could give you my wish here, I would go back in time to 2012 when Cam was at Department of Commerce, he was so brilliant. </p><p>TURNER LEE: I don't know if he wants to go back to the Department of Commerce. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LAYTON: He had this brilliant idea for a consumer-- </p><p>KERRY: Depends on which administration. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LAYTON: So, but he, the actually--it's interesting the moral to the story, they had a very--a wonderful multi stakeholder-based standards--technical based solution. Consumer privacy bill of rights which was not at all controversial.  </p><p>We weren't able to do it, but the Europeans saw it didn't happen, they came in with the GDPR and we missed this opportunity, so I hope we don't miss it again. </p><p>But you know the brains are here at the end of this panel in terms of getting the right solutions. </p><p>TURNER LEE: But I want to just before I leave from you on the compliance, what are these costs?  </p><p>Are they the costs of manpower, are they cost of sort of recalibrating systems? You know, we hear costs, what are they? </p><p>LAYTON: The number one cost is the privacy consultant, so it is a wealth transfer from the companies themselves to the privacy lawyers or consultants. IAPP have doubled their membership globally. </p><p>So, the second highest cost is the IT costs but essentially you could say, well look those companies, could you spend a million dollars innovating your products and services, could you do different things with that money? </p><p>No, we're paying the privacy lawyers and the privacy bar, they're getting rich off of this. </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, Jeff, I want to go to you. I mean we have you up here, you know as I mentioned in the disclosure that AT&amp;T does fund Brookings as well as a whole lot of other companies but I was really curious to get a company on the panel that would actually speak to how this was actually going to affect them. </p><p>So, Governor Brown, you know signed the California Consumer Privacy Act in July 2018. The press basically touted that industry was okay with it to a certain extent, right, in terms of those provisions. </p><p>And it gave some industry momentum, to sort of look at how they could either comply or get this done.  </p><p>So, I'm just really curious. Does the CCPA change the way that AT&amp;T or other companies will do business? Are you worried by these compliance costs? Or kind of going back to Joey's original comment, you know, do you see this as a way to sort of have that pressure placed on you to just do better. </p><p>You know, I'm really curious how you all are looking at this. </p><p>BRUEGGEMAN: Well first, I would say I echo thanks for hosting this event and all the work you and Cam are doing on privacy because I really do think there, we're at a moment in time where there is an opportunity here. </p><p>You know, AT&amp;T has long supported federal privacy legislation, back to the excellent work Cam did in the Obama administration. </p><p>But California really crystallized this as an issue that's going to hit every type of company, right? From the dry cleaner to other retailers to any company that uses data. So, I think it did broaden perspective and broaden the industry engagement on privacy. </p><p>At the same time, just to unpack what California really--the process. It started as a ballot initiative in 2016, then the law was adopted that summer. </p><p>It is taking effect next year and then the state AG is now drafting regulations that will take effect some time next year so we're still filling in what the law is going to mean. </p><p>And then the ballot proponent is back with another initiative on privacy that he is putting--is going to try to put on the ballot next election that would take effect in 2023. </p><p>So, I think on the one hand it has helped a lot of companies get over that, okay I'm investing--as Roslyn laid out the numbers, we're investing in the systems to give consumers the tools to manage data to comply. </p><p>So, it's a lot easier to say, let's have privacy legislation. On the other hand, there is a lot of concern about, what about the next set of regulations in California itself. Or what about another state doing something different. </p><p>Given the amount and the cost of doing this, it is extremely concerning to businesses to then say, I may have to do it, you know, ten different ways going forward. </p><p>So, on the one hand, it's catalyzed interest in privacy, on the other it's made it easier I think for industry to get behind strong privacy regulation because you were already a third of the economy is now doing this for California. </p><p>TURNER LEE: I mean to all of you, when GDPR went into effect, started getting those pop-ups, it seems like common place now, you know you get them. Most people just sort of accept them, they keep moving on, but you know it seems like again on the compliance side you actually have to be able to comply and be able to institute those systems. </p><p>But I want to talk about consumers though, right cause at the heart of this, even though there may be more burden on industry, even though companies are sort of either going to be forced into sort of this state or not. </p><p>Do consumers actually benefit from any of this stuff, going forward?  </p><p>I start with Roslyn, let's put them back in the conversation. </p><p>LAYTON: I think the best statistic on this, 18 months after GDPR, the consumer trust online for Europeans is at the lowest point it's ever been. In the 20 years that they have kept the statistics, Eurostat, you can look for yourself.   </p><p>That's stunning to me because this is reflecting a long period of time the Europeans have tried to do more and more regulation. </p><p>But the challenge is because of the approach they've taken, only half of the companies comply so it's really a sense of set it, forget it. You get the pop-up in your face, but the people accept that there's not a culture of compliance. </p><p>So you may put all the regulations in the world but if it's so expensive that the companies just say we're not complying, remember the data protection authorities in EU, they don't have more funding, they don't have training so they can't enforce all of this. They have to pick and choose what they're going to enforce. </p><p>So, the consumers are really resigned and the other part about it is the small and medium sized companies don't grow and that was the real challenge that there's not a more robust eco-system as a result of this. </p><p>And something we need to think, what are we going to get if we go to California? </p><p>TURNER LEE: I--couldn't argument be--I wanted to jump in this, but couldn't argument also be made Roslyn that sometimes the consumers don't need access to content because companies can't comply.  </p><p>Remember right after GDPR a lot of U.S. newspapers just fell off the grid-- </p><p>LAYTON: Over a thousand--over a thousand U.S. firms no longer work in the EU. </p><p>Williams Sonoma, you can't even look at their recipes but there is a missing component in this policy is that we don't have a consumer education component which we could have a tremendous difference if we had, you know, digital competence training. </p><p>Or we had--we incentivized the companies to offer training for their users, for example. Because then people would feel empowered. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Cam, you want to respond to this? </p><p>KELLY: Yeah, I--you know I think we need to put GDPR a little bit in perspective. Like I agree with some of what you said, Ros, about the effects but I think--I think there are some things, you know, the extent of innovation, the venture market, the impact on SMEs in Europe. </p><p>I'm not sure you can necessarily lay that to GDPR. I think some of that is endemic to Europe and the European economy has not been that strong.  </p><p>But I think the effects on the advertising market have been clear. I mean it's clear that both Google and Facebook have gained share. That data I think is pretty robust and I think that, that does raise competitive issues for how we deal with the sharing of information, the impact of legislation on the advertising markets. </p><p>So, we can't--I think we can fix competition issues with privacy legislation in the states, but we do need to understand intended or unintended consequences on competition from doing that. So that's--that's going to be a critical discussion going in--going forward. </p><p>I'm--I think GDPR has had one beneficial impact has been to force people to look at their data governance. </p><p>A lot of process involved but the process of saying, what are we collecting, why are we collecting and what are we doing with it, is an important step in the process. </p><p>I mean a little too--because of the regulatory requirements, it's too focused on making lots of records of what you're doing. We need a more flexible approach but those pop-ups, I mean GDPR is not all about consent. </p><p>In fact, it sort of moves things away from consent but it certainly doubles down on consent where it's used. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Joey did you--or Jeff? Both of you come in. </p><p>WENDER: A lot of people lamented when California, excuse me, when Europe went first. That somehow the Europeans were now leading the world on privacy and a lot of Americans here said, \"oh, my God, how did we let this happen\". </p><p>Now, but there's a huge benefit to that though and the benefit is they've gone first, now we learn from their mistakes. </p><p>And beyond Europe, the states are the guinea pigs, right? They're the ones that are--California is gone, and other states are to go, as well. So, what Congress is doing right now is not only looking at what's happening in Europe and what's happened in California, but they're also looking at all the other states that--and state legislatures that are now proposing legislation. So, the hope is, and I make no guarantees about the ability or wisdom of 535 members of Congress to pass a perfect bill, but the hope is, the hope is, that somehow, we will learn from all of these intended or unintended consequences of Europe and the state bills to pass something great. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Jeff, do you want to jump in? </p><p>BRUEGGEMAN: Yeah, I would second that. I think there's a real opportunity to let's learn from both California and the GDPR. Let's take the best of what is there. As I said, companies have already invested heavily to comply, so there's a strong foundation, but then let's avoid some of the mistakes. And I would go back to the point that Jerry made earlier, I think of we're successful here, things should get easier for consumers not more frustrating or more complicated and I think that should be one of the lessons from GDPR that, you know, to the extent that we can identify either types of data or uses of data that really concerned consumers and put strong restrictions on those, then let's not put everything into that basket and--and complicate their lives for just routine transactions on the Internet.  </p><p>And--and let's also make sure we're avoiding the unintended consequences about, for example, if you--if you restrict sharing but not using data that you end up helping certain companies and not other companies. So, I think--and I think the frameworks that we've seen introduced, you know, there's a lot of similarity and a lot of overlap in the thinking that I think shows there's a lot of consensus-building on some of these issues that, you know--but we should always think about the consumer as--as--when we're trying to serve.  </p><p>And I guess one last point is, I--I think sometimes, particularly in Europe, it's viewed as privacy is a trade-off for other things. And--and, you know, consumers benefit from whether it's a free ad-supported website or a new use of data that helps, you know, make a--a product better, so we need to give them both, right? We need to give them strong privacy and security productions, and all of the great things that can happen from using their data. And we really shouldn't view it as--as a trade-off if we do this right. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Yeah, go ahead, Roslyn. </p><p>LAYTON: Yeah, I just wanted to make one last point there. I think part of this process of learning from the different approaches is I actually think we'll come again to appreciate the American privacy tradition. It's over 200 years old, and it is quite robust in terms of protecting individual privacy, particularly against the administrative state. And it is also had a tremendous reliance on the importance of recognizing the public's right to know. So, you have some terrible situations in the EU where murderers or child predators, they're able to erase the records about their crimes, so that you can't--you know, there's invaluable public information that cannot be accessed anymore because of this fundamentalist approach to--to--to--to data and--and sort of individual command-and-control rights. </p><p>But just the one thing I would say about the U.S. approach, people forget that we have over two dozen privacy laws in very specific cases because we followed an extreme democratic approach where we would identify the harm. We--Congress came forward, actually has done a tremendous amount, where there are industries where they would identify this is the problem, this is the harm, this is what we're going to do about it. So, there are privacy regulators all over the U.S., and we have to be careful that we don't torpedo the existing rules that have been developed over, you know, decades and centuries in the U.S., but also to appreciate that what's there and how do we complement that?  </p><p>We don't want to dismantle it but learn from those things. And the consumers and voters have spoken because they appreciated the American approach said, we're going to identify the dangerous uses of data. We're going to deal with that, but we're going to not assume that every use of data is wrong. We're going to allow permission less innovation, and consumers have valued that, you know, the United States is today one-third of the world's Internet economy. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Well, and it's so interesting. And I am sitting here writing like a whole lot of notes, some of the questions that I sent you previously, and some that I'm actually going to just give you now, right? Because I think this also brings up, and I think the point around GDPR being placed with an American context is different, right? We have a different relationship to the Internet, Clinton-Gore, we made it free.  </p><p>There was a reciprocal relationship. That's a little different from, but we actually see in Europe. And you know, Cam and I have been conversations where Europe is really clear, you know, without really strong privacy policies. You know, innovation may be sacrificed, but that's okay, right, as long as people are protected.  </p><p>But I do have this question because again, for the purpose of why people are here, we're no longer talking about GDPR. We're talking about a state law in the United States, that in many respects, recognizes the cultural context in which we all are consumers. So, I'm really curious now that we have California coming to--into fruition and we still have federal privacy legislation unsettled, you know, which side will be error upon?  </p><p>Will we try to take those lessons from GDPR, fill in the blind spots around compliance, and go along with California for about 3 to 4 months before federal legislators do something or will we look at the federal legislation a lot more carefully based on the blind spots, you know, that are in the California law? I'm just curious how California changes the nature of the game for federal privacy legislation and that standard? Any of you can answer that question. Go ahead, Joey. </p><p>WEDNER: I'll take it. I'll--I'll speak on behalf of Congress. No problem. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No problem. Well, I would--I would take your question and take it to the next level. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yes, yes. </p><p>WEDNER: The conversation is going to shift very quickly in 2020. And it's not to simply be about California, but it's good to be about Washington state, and it's good to be about Massachusetts, and it's going to be about all the other states that start acting. So, the world we live in now is going to change very rapidly, and so it's not to be, you know, as Cam accurately and on point recognized that there's no way the House of Representatives would pass anything that was weaker than the California state standard, given that about a quarter of their caucuses from California, included the speaker. The question is now to be--is soon going to become these laws are in a different with each other.  </p><p>The California law will be different than the Washington state one, or the Massachusetts one, or the New York one, or the Maryland one, or whatever else it might be. And so, how do we reconcile those differences one? And then two, what does, and the word I'm amazed that it's worth 38 minutes into this panel, and the world has--the P-word has not been used yet. </p><p>TURNER LEE: I was getting there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WEDNER: Because that is the word and its preemption. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yes. </p><p>WAGNER: Preemption. What does preemption look like? Because let's just be--let's be honest with ourselves, let's be honest, a lot of what is pushing, driving industry to want federal privacy legislation in the U.S. Congress is because they don't want to have to follow a patchwork of different state laws. They want the feds to come in and preempt the states so that we have one national standard.  </p><p>But again, what--then it becomes what does that preemption look like? Not all preemption is created equal. Is the ceiling? Is it a floor? How expensive is the preemption? How narrowly is it drawn? And I guarantee that that in many--that the extent of rulemaking at the FTC and what this private right of action will look like will--it will probably come down to those final issues on whether we can get final privacy legislation across the finish line. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Cam-- </p><p>KERRY: So, one other thing that's going to happen in 2020, is that the--the--the dial on the Californium is going to move because Alastair McTaggart, the proponent of--of the--the referendum proposal that led to the adoption of the CCPA has a version, too and the pipeline. And--and that's going to come to the California legislature, you know, sometime in the spring, about the same time that the Attorney General regulations that will raise the bar on the--the version 1 are going to come into effect. So, that--that's going to be ratcheting up. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Um-hum. Go ahead. </p><p>LAYTON: So, what--I mean, there--the gentleman are absolutely right. This is going to be coming to--to head if you will, in 2020. I think the importance is to say is that many people just assume because it's government regulation that it's the voice of the consumer. And I would push back on that because what's really going on is it's an empowerment of government.  </p><p>Consumers have very different views about privacy, and if you look at the way the California CCPA came together, Alastair McTaggart made millions of dollars as a real estate guy using personal data to grow his business. And he had--he didn't like the way Supercuts would collect your email whenever you know you signed up to get a haircut. Well, there's some people who happen to like Supercuts. And they don't--they don't have a prop--they want to get coupons and deals and so on, but it offended his sensibilities.  </p><p>So, the actual voices of consumers are very different, and they're diverse. So, I actually think the way through this is that we need to understand there's big tech, the large platforms. They're one order. I mean, we're talking about companies that are the size of--they are larger than countries. </p><p>It is very different than, you know, the run-of-the-mill ISP. It's very different than the--the church website or the school website or something you have in your home and I actually think we need to build the appropriate standards around that and have safe harbors so that we can evolve to a rational, reasonable world. We don't assume everyone's Google. I think that's ridiculous, but we're--we're expecting oh my goodness, you know, this--Brookings, why don't you have, you know, these.  </p><p>And--and then they're also looking at, you know, this challenge now because we're creating--asymmetry with government. Because you don't have the right to delete your data with government, can you imagine going to the health care services and saying I just want to delete my data now? How are you can continue to get your--your healthcare insurance? So--so, there are some serious questions there, and I think what we need to kind of do is cordon off the--the concerns where the harm is, for example, platforms. It's very different than ordinary websites and other industries.  </p><p>TURNER LEE: Right. And so, Jeff, I want to come over to you because CCPA, though assumes that all companies are the same, right? That there is this assumption that compared to GDPR, we are, I think, going to see in CCPA a lot of the definitions, a lot of the rules applied to every company from the dry cleaner to the big tech company. Is that something in terms of compliance, and, you know, will cause any kind of regulatory confusion? Will there be issues related to that in terms of, you know, what data is for the--Rosslyn, I think what you are mentioning what's for the good of the consumers versus what's not. I mean, where's the confusion going to come when everybody's sort of put into the same bucket? </p><p>BERGMAN: Right. I think we may see some confusion in California next year. I do--would, you know, pick up on what Joey said, I think, but think about that multiplied by 10 to 20 times if we get--a number of other states acting. I think, to their credit, many states have taken a step back and said that California law is very complicated. There are a lot--high potential for unintended consequences.  </p><p>We're going to take our time and think through this. So, I think there's a window to do something, but, you know, the complexity will only grow if we have this patchwork of regulations. So, think about it. Almost any business is online today, right?  </p><p>If I have to have a different user in our fast--interface sent a--set of privacy terms, controls that are different depending on where my customers are located, and by the way, my customers move all the time and may have complicated the relationships, I think we're going to paralyze a lot of things, especially on the Internet. So, let's get this right. Let's have strong protections and let's have it be flexible enough so that whether you're a brick-and-mortar store or you are a tech company or you're a small business. Again, if we do this right, we want to be sure that privacy protections apply across the board, but we need to not be so prescriptive that you can't accommodate that variation. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Cam? </p><p>KERRY: (OFF-MIC) Yeah. So, CCPA does have a carveout for small businesses based on, you know, the--the volume of business or the number of--of records that you have and that's something that was adopted in the--the Democratic bill in--in the Senate. I--and I think an across-the-board carveout is maybe too broad because, you know, anybody that collects data should at least be thinking about privacy and, you know, have some obligations to handle that data appropriately. And actually, the Worker bill adopts that approach and then carves out certain obligations, so, you know, the--the access correction, etc., obligations, you know, there's--there's a carveout.  </p><p>And those are the ones that really, you know, have the significant compliance costs. I mean, all the backend process of designing the consents, designing the portals, having the capacity in the company to actually turn over those records. You know, that's--that's where the real, you know, where the real effort comes in.  </p><p>TURNER LEE: Um-hum. So, I want to take questions in just a few moments. If you have a question, we'll come out and actually have the--my friends here and colleagues at Brookings help us to direct those questions. I do want to ask this final question of this panel of something to think about. So, I started with the sandwich model, GDPR, CCPA. In the middle, the meat. If you're a vegetarian the tomato-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Could actually be federal privacy legislation, right, which takes the good of--of each side and adds a little bit more flavor to it. Or perhaps it--it's so flavorful like a pastrami sandwich that it just dismisses the bread, right? We've talked about process, compliance, enforcement, covered entities, discrimination, legal recourse. I'd like to hear from each of you, where we land upon federal privacy legislation, given that? Which of these areas will we have to do a little bit more discussion on? What are some areas that may--we may want to do better definition? But, you know, I think that both sides of the sandwich give us something to work. I think it is what was mentioned earlier. Cam? </p><p>KERRY: Geez, I don't know. I think I got a mess on my face at this point. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TURNER LEE: What area like should--should out of all of the things that of sort of come up on the, what should we be focusing on-- </p><p>KERRY: Look, I think there's obviously a big gap on both preemption and private right of action. I think that you know, those things kind of work to--together but. you know. You get one national standard that provides strong protections so building on what's there in terms of the--the limitations on collection and use, and retention sharing of data. And, you know, some forms of strong redress. I'm not sure that that's going to likely to wind up being a broad private right of action that brings the class action bar in as a--a force multiplier but I think that there--there is a path to--to get there and that's, I think, the project of the next three or four months.  </p><p>TURNER LEE: Okay. Joey? </p><p>WEDNER: I agree with all that. I would add two other issues. One is again, what are the use limitations? Are we going to prohibit companies from sharing or selling your biometric information? You know it's been said if somebody steals your Social Security number, you can apply for a new one. But if someone steals your--your facial image, you can't get a new face. You could try but you can't get a new face. That was a joke, guys. Come on. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) I was going to say because you can get a new face. </p><p>WEDNER: Right, right. Sand--there's a sandwich metaphor. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I would say that's--that's the--I would say that's the--the first area that there's going to be a lot of discussion on what are those uses limitations.  </p><p>The second is, and this is contemplated in both the Cantwell bill and in the Wicker bill, is, are we creating difference regimes for sensitive versus nonsensitive information? What is sensitive? What is nonsensitive? What applies? That's--that's a very complicated conversation, particularly when it's--when it's recognized at the--that the universe of sensitive information online is only increasing, so you don't want to have a static definition either. Or do you not even use that paradigm altogether, and you just have--you just have--you really just have an exception for information that is transmitted in the course of a transaction versus everything else. So, I think those types of--those types of questions are very real. They're very current and I don't think there's a--it's not clear what exactly the answer should be right now. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Roslyn? </p><p>LAYTON: So, I'm ultimately optimistic that the process will--will play on the right way, particularly because I see where we are is a--it's part of being the long journey for America where we have had this--this interplay between the states and the federal government. And interstate commerce is an issue going back to the Constitution. So, these always--these things have been there.  </p><p>The two areas I think that will come to--will have more to play in 2020, one will be the Uniform Law Commission. This is a group of state-based actors who are working together. I mean, in addition to Congress, we have all kinds of state-based actors who are trying to resolve the differences in states because they to see the importance of maintaining a valuable, seamless Internet economy that we have, so--so that will be there. And by the way, this is more than the Europeans ever did. They did not have these levels of discussion and detail, all the--every state working in that way, so I'm even more encouraged because of the quality of the discussion. </p><p>And the other part, I'd say, is we can take a better look at independent certifiable standards. These are our privacy-based standards, security-based standards that are developed in independent institutes. We're not relying on someone subjective definition, but those can also resolve a lot of the questions that we have where, you know, people want to say it has to be this way. But we could look at how a standard's written and then map our technology to the standard and I think that that will help us in some of those places where we have the impasse. </p><p>And then, my hope is that Congress will also think about safe harbors. Because a lot of companies they want to do the right thing. They don't have millions of dollars. They want to get there. They need time to do it. And then, I think that our lawmakers will be--they'll see that that's going in the right direction and adopt a sort safe harbor to allow companies to--to evolve. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Just? </p><p>BERGMAN: So, we've kind of looked back, on this panel, of how did we get to where we are but I think in privacy legislation we also need to look ahead and we're on the cusp of AI, machine learning, and incredible uses of data and I think there is a--you know, we do not address all those issues at this point, but we certainly need to be taking account of them. And we need to be thinking about how we protect consumers and stop behavior that we don't want with data while not being so restrictive that we don't enable those exciting new services. I think if we do that, we actually will have an advantage globally in how we address privacy.  </p><p>And then the second issue. Back to Cam's point, enforcement. I think it's an underappreciated component of privacy legislation is how much this is strengthening the FTC's enforcement and state enforcement on privacy, new fining authority, you know, just regulatory authority, and stricter rules that are to make it easier to enforce. And so, I think we talk about issues like private right of action, we should do it in the broader context of let's look at the overall picture . And make sure consumers have remedies that they're strong enforcement, but that--that is a broader a set of requirements that are in these privacy bills.  </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah, and I would say, you know, moderator privilege before we open it up. I think all of what you have said is correct, right, in terms of where we're going to go on this trajectory. I think it is important that we look at machine learning and AI as sort of a separate conversation because of the technological nuances. But I think privacy legislation, on the discriminations side, which I think GDPR has covered this and I know California will go even deeper, discrimination is purely wrong, whether it's online or offline. So, I think there are easy fixes to actually ensure that the statues that exist today apply to privacy legislation.  </p><p>But I do want to keep going back to compliance. I mean, I think there's also this issue of how do you not create a patchwork of what you're saying, still give strong state authority and jurisdiction while not having privacy attorneys become richer. Sorry, some of the attorneys out there, right? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>This is really going back to the base of the problem that we're trying to solve, and not the one that we're trying to create.  </p><p>So, with that, and I had to ask. You know, I couldn't sit here and the last panel of today and not say nothing. I'm sorry everybody, but I feel I've got to be here.  </p><p>I want to ask questions of the audience, so I'm going to start from the front and lead to the back. We've given some time. I'm glad to see a lot of hands up. Let's start with this young man right here. And then, we'll switch over to my dear friend here. And then, we'll move our way back. Okay, just say your name and direct your question. I'll ask that these be questions and not commentary so we can get everybody in and the panel--this will respond accordingly.  </p><p>QUESTION: Richard Coleman. (SP) I retired from Customs and Border Protection when it was called the Customs Service or Bureau of Customs. One of my jobs was answering Freedom of Information Act Requests and Privacy Act request. The government was limited on what it could collect and how it could disseminate information. All of that was in the public interest of a law enforcement agency.  </p><p>I can't get my brain around the idea that corporations should be allowed to get your personal data, which is not in the person--public interest. Buy it and sell it. And the objection that it would be too costly to change presumes that the--that the default position was they get to keep the information. I think the default position should be they don't get to keep the information unless they can justify that it's in public interest.  </p><p>And the idea that there's a cost-benefit analysis, Americans With Disability Act, what's the cost-benefit of that? The Civil Rights Legislation, what's the cost-benefit of that? Doing the right thing? What's the--what's the cost-benefit. It just doesn't make sense. </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, you want to make that as a comment or a question? </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>TURNER LEE: Okay. </p><p>LAYTON: (OFF-MIC) Do you want to ask them to put all of their questions in. And then-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: I thought about that, but we've got a little bit of time for me to do one Ros, because--I'm trying to make sure I keep my focused attention here. So, I'll treat that as a comment. Okay, you all heard it. I think that's why we're trying to pass better privacy legislation. So, I think you're right on point with that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Let's go to the next question. Yeah, we got you. You got it. Here, help them out. Um-hum. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Paul Schrader (SP). Thanks, Nicol. So, three quick things, I guess questions. So, one is I work for a startup serving people with disabilities where maintaining and holding data could actually be really helpful for our customers. I worry though that often in these cases it's companies like ours that pay the price when, you know, the elephants are fighting Facebook, Google, etc. we're the ones that get stomped on by government action potentially. So, how do we protect startups doing good things, but also ensure that startups who could be doing harmful things aren't--aren't allowed to do harmful things?  </p><p>And then it--the thing that surprised me that you did talk about is revenue models. So, consumers expect and love having free Facebook and free Google search, but there's a cost to that and--and the cost of that is advertising and targeted advertising and we see where that goes, so. How do we deal with that?  </p><p>And then finally, enforcement penalties. I'm really surprised you didn't talk about that and whether we need a different regime for enforcement penalties. Many have complained that the FTC findings--enforcement have been far too low on the companies where they have found fault. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Paul, thank you for that. We're going to have more events. So, we'll talk more about that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>All right. Go ahead, Roslyn. </p><p>LAYTON: I want to thank you for that question. And if I haven't mistaken, I recall you testified in Congress on a prioritization hearing. It was a brilliant example of how technology can be used for good and the importance of when we had this kind of one-size-fits-all about how we treat the Internet that we are going--we will eliminate important services such as yours. And how you are, you know, you can get assistance walking across the street. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Yeah. </p><p>LAYTON: Anyway, I so appreciate that you're here and that you're involved in this debate and you've made so many good points. On enforcement, take an example of the FTC with Facebook. This $5 million settlement. That's $5 million, 200 times more than we have ever had for any privacy settlement in the United States and its 20 times more than what Facebook would be charged in the European Union under GDPR.  </p><p>And by the way, that was done in less than one year, with the existing resources at the FTC, and without any new laws. So, we don't know if anything will ever come to pass with Facebook in the European Union because Facebook will probably sue them, and they can't ever get that much money. So, I think that that's worthy of looking at in terms of what the FTC can do today and all of the legislation talks about strengthening the FTC. So, that is one area. </p><p>The other thing is, the restrictions now on Facebook as a result of that settlement are actually--go beyond the GDPR in terms of the personal certifications Mark Zuckerberg has to make to the FTC every single quarter on pain of, not death but grim--criminal penalties. He can go to jail, as well as the chief privacy officer. So, if anyone doubts that the FTC can't step in, they can. And that sends a signal to business. I also think that what's good about that is that we haven't saddled every company with the same obligations as Facebook because they haven't done anything wrong. But this was a case where the harm needed to be remedied and the FTC stepped in.  </p><p>So, I guess, the--the other thing that you're--I am not going to take all the time, I just wanted to make that point. I'm sure the other panelists could-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) Anybody else want to comment before I go to the next one? </p><p>KERRY: Yes. Just two--two quick comments. As has been pointed out, all of the bills would strengthen the fining authority of the--the FTC and allow it to issue fines in the first instance, which it could not do in the Facebook case. And secondly, I think in terms of dealing with the--the beneficial uses of data, I think it's important to focus--on sort of a general duty of fairness. This is something that I think the--the bills are getting at and still struggling to find exactly the right formulation. But, you know, to really--companies talk about being data stewards and I think that is the--the--the key goal is to make people good stewards of data. And you know, the good steward puts the interests of the principal ahead of their own. </p><p>TURNER LEE: (OFF-MIC) That's right. Okay. I've got time for one more question. This gentleman over here. That's giving me. I contact. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUESTION: Good morning. In the call-in Brookings, thanks for inviting us and all. And my question really is going to go to Joe. As a standard-setting bought--data standard-setting body and education, we support a federal standard, but there has to be an educational piece to that and I'm wondering if there will. And the reason is, I actually don't think there's going to be a sea of change from the consumer perspective because Americans are blinded by the word free and it is a fraudulent use of the word. And unless there's something in there, Americans are going to see free and not care and click the box and pry--all this is going to be in vain. But will there be something in legislation about education and about--I mean, credit reporting agencies. Do consumers know how credit reporting agencies work? </p><p>WEDNER: So, the answer is we hope. I mean, we obviously want to have an educational piece to this. And what I would say--this is the whole challenge that we're happening right now, in many ways, is that people do like these companies, right? They like the fact that they're free because they don't actually have to pay a dime upfront for it, and they always work, and as the--the previous gentleman said, people like targeted advertising, right? These are things that people--for the most part, that people like. They help drive the economy and help get people what they need.  </p><p>That being said, if you watch--if you watch the polling that's being done. There's more and more awareness amongst the American people that wait a second. There's a sinister side to this. Wait, what am I giving up? What am I giving up? I mean, the first--the first gentleman, who's comment who I agree with, you know, and this has been asked of Mark Zuckerberg when he was before the Senate Commerce Committee, is who owns your information, right? Who owns it? Obviously, we believe that the consumer continues to own his or her information and that privacy is a fundamental right. But how are all of these things balanced? And--and--and how, you know, how is all this information explained to consumers? I think that's the challenge that we have right now in writing this--in writing this large bill. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Um-hum. So, we've run out of time. So, I want to offer you a couple of--holiday presents. First, our panelists, let's give them a round of applause.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>You can find each and every one of them on the Internet, so please continue this dialogue through the privacy debate or directly to them. And then, I'm going to give you two more holiday presents before you run out of here.  </p><p>The second one is the series that we haven't Brookings call the Privacy Debates run by my colleague Cam Kerry. We're all invested in the dialogue around this and I encourage all of you to look at a recent blog that he put out a couple of weeks ago in addition to the information that we'll be sharing from other scholars. </p><p>And then the third gift is our AI series here at Brookings. We have a broad institutional AI focus, which is looking at governance, bias, and national security. Right now, on the Brookings website, are a series of papers around governance, as well as on bias. So, I also offer that to you for free to visit our website and look at that.  </p><p>I just want to say thank you all. This was a really important conversation to have as we go on the next eve of the next decade into the passage of the CCPA. So, let's keep talking because I think what we learned this conversation is there's more to be done. Thank you very much and have a good rest of the day. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BERGMAN: Thank you. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Oh, before I forget. This is new. Fill out that darn paper, please. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And leave it with one of our Brookings staff and colleagues in the back.

Thank you. Let me get my notes out. Good afternoon, everyone. Oh, I need a little bit more than that. You've had about five cups of coffee before you got here. So I'll say one more time. Good afternoon, everyone. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Good afternoon. </p><p>LEE: Thank you. I'm so happy to actually see everybody here once again at Brookings. I know that we have some of you who are new to a Brookings session. I won't ask you to raise your hand, but I would say welcome to you. And I know we got some repeat visitors that come to many Brookings sessions, so I would say welcome back. I don't know the last time that you were here, and I actually don't know if you were here last week for a privacy conversation. But if you were, you're going to get a little bit more privacy today. I'm excited for this particular conversation for a variety of reasons. How many of you have heard that we are trying to pass federal privacy legislation in the United States? How many heard that about a year ago? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>How many of you heard about six month ago? And you're going to hear about it today. And I say that because, despite all of the perfect storm that sort of converged when privacy legislation was actually, you know, restarted, we're still at this place where we haven't come up with what we think is really good comprehensive privacy legislation. And in my role, and I'm going to introduce the panelists, I'm Nicol Turner Lee, I work in the Center for Technology Innovation as a fellow. </p><p>And I basically have three buckets of work that I actually spend a lot of my time on. The first one is around regulatory and legislative policy. I see some friends out here. I've been doing this for quite some time. In fact, I'm not going to date myself because I have this young hairstyle so I'm trying to look like my daughter. But when we started talking about privacy in the Obama administration, to be back in 2008, 2009, many of us were in that conversation. My colleague Cam Kerry, who was at Commerce at the time, brought many of us together to talk about online consumer privacy. Back then we were just dealing with the Internet of Things. And some of you may remember that. </p><p>I also work on issues related to the digital divide. And yes, I'm going to give a shameless plug. I have a book coming out next year on the U.S. digital divide and I've completed a seven city tour of the United States on how people are accessing digital resources. So that will come out soon. And then finally, I work on issues related to artificial intelligence, particularly algorithmic bias. So that ties into the privacy conversation and we'll see how long we have. I've got a feisty group, just wait, in terms of the discussion. If we get there in terms of other spooks that are under the privacy umbrella, we'll talk about that. </p><p>So why did I decide I want to have this outside of being somebody who focuses in that first bucket? There have been a lot of privacy conversations going on. And in those conversations, we edge one inch closer, as all of us showed by raising her hand, and one inch backwards. And so what I'm really interested in and I think the panelists appear will help us clean this out and unpack this a little bit, is one, why we haven't made a lot of progress in the last six months, and then two, when we look at federal privacy legislation as this umbrella, what are the spokes that are sort of being debated right now? So all of us have really talked about the principles. Cam Kerry and I sort of have tag teamed on this in terms of the need for some either comprehensive or baseline or whatever you want to talk--call it in terms of the framework. </p><p>But then if you think about an umbrella, there are these little pieces that keep the umbrella solid. And under that, maybe some of the issues that we'll talk about today, which are cloud computing applications, healthcare applications, et cetera. But we've got to unpack why we even have not even opened the umbrella wide enough to figure out how to get the type of bipartisan support. So with me today are three folks that I consider to be just wonderful people, generally. I have known them for most of my life here in DC, but also, they've got something to say and I want them to share it from the Brookings stage. </p><p>So I'm going to start at the bottom. She's not an unfamiliar face here at Brookings and she's got a new job. Amie Stepanovich is now the executive director at Silicon Flatirons where she is a nationally recognized expert before then and now in domestic surveillance, cybersecurity and privacy law. Before that, she was the U.S. policy manager and global policy counsel to Access Now. And now in Boulder where she has a much better view than those of us in DC--you know, I had to ask her. Look how relaxed she looks compared to all of us. Right? She's actually moving that forward in terms of privacy, and we'll hear more about her in this new role in a few minutes. Let's give her a round of applause. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Morgan is another friend, and he's somebody that I used to see often at the oil change place. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Because we live in the same neighborhood. He's the president of the act--the act--of act, the App Association, where he represents more than 5000 app makers and connected devices in the mobile economy. He leads the organization's advocacy and strategy on behalf of small to medium-size businesses on policy issues such as privacy, intellectual property, competition, and small business innovation. Let's give him a round of applause. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And Jamie. And we've actually had the opportunity to sit on a panel together as well. Another friend. She began her career at CTA as a director of government affairs in 2014 and was promoted to senior director in 2017. Her current scope includes policy expertise on self-driving vehicles, transportation innovation, and privacy. And before that, she served in the Washington DC office of Representative Bill Schuster, representative from Pennsylvania and the then chairman of the House Transportation Infrastructure Committee. Let's give her a round of applause. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>David Young, there's a seat for you up here. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Call him out since we have no ushers. It's not like church. So let me jump into this first question. I told you there a feisty group starting with myself, okay? </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>LEE: Yeah, right. No collection. We will not have a collection plate at Brookings. So it may start this first question with this panel. Why has this dialogue sort of been extended since I think many people in this room probably heard about the need for privacy legislation following the perfect storm of Cambridge Analytica, right? But prior to that, there's been discussions. But why has it been so long, and really for this audience, who is probably following this, how has the debate changed over the last six months? You know, what are the--what are the stakes now compared to six month ago? Amie, why don't we start with you. And let people know, again, a little bit more about your organization. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Sure. So six months ago I was actually still in DC working on the privacy legislation conversations. That changed about three months ago. I moved to Boulder, Colorado and took over Silicon Flatirons, which is--I'm going to be a little bit biased here, probably one of the preeminent tech think tanks at a law school in the country. We worked on tech policy convening's, student development, and entrepreneurship outreach. And so I have been leading some of the work that we've been doing outside of Silicon Flatirons. </p><p>But previous to that, I was deeply involved in some of the conversations that are happening in DC around privacy. And if I were to answer Nicol's question about why that has stalled out, I think one of the reasons is we never got a vehicle. People were waiting for--there were so many laws. I can count on two hands the number of privacy proposals or bills or principles that I saw. But there is this promise of a bipartisan draft law that everybody thought was going to be the one that everybody kind of bought into and tried to make better and was going to move forward. And we never got the language on that. And I think one of the reasons for that is people--the privacy issue continues to evolve. The CCPA is now concrete. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, and for those of you--that's the California Privacy Act. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: The California--yes. </p><p>LEE: That's pending. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: The California consumer privacy act is kind of moving into implementation at the beginning of next year. The news stories around privacy keep coming out and people keep realizing that it impacts different communities and different categories of people and different ways. And every time that story develops, a new member of Congress decides that they have to be involved in these conversations and be included in the room, which means you have to wrap in their staff and get them up to speed and get them to buy in to what's being produced, and that takes a lot of time. </p><p>I will say I don't think it's that thing that we are at this point. It means that we are listening to more people. We're taking in more perspectives. It does mean that people may not be happy with the fact that the California law is going to go into effect. But again, I personally don't think that's a bad thing, having more protections, having companies look into how to apply those protections in the United States. So I think the conversation continues to move. People continue to show that they are interested and involved, and we will eventually see a federal privacy law. Is it going to be next year in an election year? Probably not. But the--it's to be continued. It's not stopped. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Morgan, let me run to you and ask you that question. </p><p>REED: So I think one of the fascinating parts, you said six months, but I see Aaron Burstein (PH) sitting here in the audience and I remember when he was 12 years--10 years ago working on the green paper, which was a comprehensive privacy legislation. And then you ended up at the FTC for a while, again, pushing comprehensive privacy legislation. And there's a well-known think tank/advocate advocacy group here in DC where I think they must've had a swear jar in their office that you put money in every time you didn't mention the word conference of privacy legislation. I think we all know which group I'm talking about. Three letters. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So it's not as though this topic hasn't been at the forefront for more than a decade. The underlying--a lot of the underlying problem comes down to what happens in most of these cases that, depending on how the language is crafted, there will be winners and losers. And so there is a sense that legislation that puts its thumb on one side of the scale or the other is going to meet fierce opposition. Amie was mentioning something that we've all lived through where you get close to a draft and then some and he comes in the room at the last minute. And she can tell that story better that I can later, but comes in at the last minute and says oh, I just have three words. You know, and the reality is with comprehensive privacy legislation, I think we all have to be clear eyed about that reality. </p><p>I think the reason you said the six months is I think consumers are becoming a bit more clear eyed about the value of their information and where they sit in the marketplace. And I think that with the GDPR, that's the European version of conference a privacy legislation, with California, with the attempt in Washington state with facial recognition, I think it's--it's the consumer now that is in a different position, and I think. And I think, before I handed over, I think one of the last parts is for the first time we are now seeing market competition around privacy. I don't think anyone can deny that Apple has made a decision to market on privacy. Their CEO has sent letters. They've put that statement out there that we are betting our purchasers of our products want this message. </p><p>So I'd say one, winners and losers are going to make some decisions different. Two, I think the consumers have a better sense of the value of their product. And three, I think you see companies making an active decision to speak to consumers about their privacy and why it has value. So I think that's why the conversation has changing, and will get to a little bit more on CCP afterwards. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>REED: But that's what I'd go with. </p><p>LEE: Jamie, what do you think? </p><p>BOONE: Sure, yeah. Morgan and Amie both made really, really good points that I generally agree with. You know, last year we started really having this conversation on why we needed federal privacy legislation between GDPR and then CCPA moving. There was a lot of pressure and a lot of pressure not just from consumers, but also from industry for that clarity at the federal level. You know, it comes to an election, you have, you know, a flip in the House, you have a lot of new staff, you have--and Senate Commerce, you have new chairman and a new ranking member, all staff that needs to get, you know, engaged in a conversation. In the House you have a flip, you know, and all of the leadership and you have to wait for people to get staffed up. So you know, that takes six months just to get people caught up in making sure that they're having all of the right meetings with the right people and getting that input. </p><p>I think another thing that is happened is that we've seen in the last, you know, last couple months there's been this pushback on tech in general and looking at liability with Section 230 and now antitrust and competition. I think privacy is maybe getting a little bit lost in that shuffle where we have all these really big topics and big issues all relating to tech. And while I'd argue most--a lot of them have to do with a lot more than just tech and especially privacy impacts a lot more than just tech companies, I think a lot of those things are getting kind of conflated and it just gets messier, especially when you have a lot of committees with overlapping or fighting over jurisdiction of who gets to do what and who needs to be in the room when it gets very messy, which it makes it harder. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, you know, I want to actually stay on that for just a second, if you don't mind, and maybe get some reaction from Morgan and Amie. I mean, are we seeing, like, this blurred line or this fuzziness now? Because it does appear like in the last six months there has been a lot of press towards, you know, big tech shakeup in these--you know, the presidential campaigns have sort of made it their business. Interestingly enough, do not just necessarily just take privacy, but take a whole range of tech issues and sort of put them in the same bucket. How do we sort of un-tease out of that or unpack out of those discussions that privacy is still pretty important? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: You want to just-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Why don't you start? </p><p>REED: So-- </p><p>LEE: --You need this, probably, to start. </p><p>REED: Right, well, no-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --I get to play cleanup-- </p><p>LEE: --Collaboration. </p><p>REED: So I think one of the problems is, and I--and I think it's a bit of laziness, we tend to lump tech into one phrase. But the reality is is that retail is tech. In fact, we'll talk about it on CCPA a little bit. I mean, retail has affinity cards and they have huge quantity of data. And so retail is tech. And there's this interesting divide. There's a tendency to lump Facebook, Google, Apple, all of them together, but it was interesting on the--I testified before the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Antitrust, and we were all on the panel. It was Amazon and Apple and Facebook and Google and--and I was there, and Tim Wu and we all went down the line and it was funny. </p><p>By the end of the hearing, it was--I think it was Senator--Congressman Armstrong who was like oh, Apple. Yeah, we'll ask you some questions, but you haven't been really part of the discussion, because they were focused on some of these privacy questions that were coming up. And it was interesting how what was happening as they were asking these privacy questions, they were asking questions about well, what are you doing with data? </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: And the Apple person was like well, we don't really use it. And then other, you know, so each person had kind of had their own niche. So I think one of it is there's a tendency to lump everybody together and I think that's a mistake. That's a mistake in terms of how we talk about it. And two, I think that to tease it out gets to the key factor, which is look, we're talking about your information and your personal assessment of what its value is both to you and in the marketplace. What are you willing to provide to somebody who collects data in exchange for a service? </p><p>And I think that's--that's the tease out. Are you good with that exchange? And then I know you deal with this too, which is do you think people understand what that exchange is? The privacy policies even--look, you were talking about earlier about reading them. I don't know the privacy policies are the methodology to get--to help people understand that exchange, sometimes. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I mean, I think privacy policies have been written over time in a way that takes the power away from people being able to--I think the we could get there and there's been a lot of, particularly academic conversations about what a privacy policy needs to entail and what it needs to be shown and-- </p><p>LEE: --Right. Right-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --But I don't think that they are written now in a way that allow people to have any idea what information they are turning over, what it could be used for, how long it's going to be held. It's just as a sophisticated user of technology, I have no idea half the time. So I--people who don't spend their days--their day jobs reading privacy policies, I have no hope for. And I, like-- </p><p>LEE: --It's true-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --And it's not on their fault. </p><p>LEE: Right. Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: It's just everything is stacked against them. To your point though, I think a lot of these conversations stem from common feelings. I've been manipulated, I've been abused, I have had my either information or interacted with a company or store or platform that has taken advantage of me. And so all of these tech conversations kind of stem out of common feelings, and maybe we do need to separate them back out. But in a way, this is going to be a very unpopular point of view, this is like a slight pitch, we maybe need to bring them together a little bit because there's a little bit of the solution in each of these conversations toward the overall issue of manipulation on the Internet. And once we start pulling that in, like when you talk about the \"fake news or misinformation\" situation, that's a societal problem. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: It's not really a tech problem. And so we have to kind of pull out and think what are the little things that we can do that move us forward across the space. Now, those each have their own incredibly nuanced conversations, but pulling out might actually help a little bit in this. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's why I've been using this analogy of the umbrella with the spokes, right? Because I think part of what's happened in this conversation for me in the last six months is that the spokes are becoming more defined. And since there are so many of them, everybody sort of pitching and what they think this spoke should be on it, and it's gone beyond the traditional conversations we had about consent framework and, you know, data metallization mitigation, it's--it's going to bias and discrimination and this and that. But I do have a question because none of you have actually set it in the first 10 minutes of this panel, which is the word preemption. And so I'm curious to see if that conversation has gotten better or worse in the last six months, before we go into more details on how we actually get to some type of federal privacy legislation. </p><p>BOONE: Yeah, I don't know that it's moved a whole lot. I think that, you know, everyone has kind of got there--kind of in their corners as we were talking about earlier on the preemption question. I think this just happens. It's not unique to privacy. It happens in-- </p><p>LEE: --Everything, right-- </p><p>BOONE: --A lot of things especially everything. Give me an issue that--and I'll find some way to relate preemption to it. But we are now looking in California, right, and they've just closed out their legislative session. We'll start to see, you know, what the AG does with it in the next year what implementation looks like. I think that makes this whole conversation harder that we've gotten so far down the road with California by itself because you've got, you know, just looking at the politics of it, you've got the speaker of the House, California, you've got huge delegation from California, primarily, that you know, our Democrats and generally will want to support their state and their state's law. How do you reconcile that in the House and get it--something through the House that preempts California but doesn't, in a way. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>BOONE: Right? And then that same thing then get through a Republican Senate. I think the politics on that are really hard. So you know, we were just discussing how you--how do you move toward each other in the preemption question? And I don't know how you do that without us seeing something to react to on paper-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>BOONE: To get people to come to the table-- </p><p>LEE: --Go ahead, one more reaction to this because we've got 20 plus states. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Sure. So for those of you who don't know, and this is DC, I'm not going to forget that I'm back in DC, but preemption is the conversation around the degree of federal laws going to write over state law. And the reason that is really unhelpful that people have kind of gone into their corners is because broad preemption, which a lot of people say, like, we just need preemption, we need to preempt all the state laws, could impact so much broader than that see CPA. It could go after civil rights law, it could go after abortion law, it could go after anything that kind of comes into the realm of privacy. And so you--even the people who I think really want broad preemption don't necessarily want the broadest of preemption. </p><p>On the other side, you could have no preemption at all, which could allow people to pass laws that conflict outright at the state and the federal level. So even on the side, nobody goes all the way to the end. I think they at least want basic conflict preemption. They want a federal law that, to the extent that it conflicts with state law, one standard will take over. And then between those two layers, there are 50,000 other options and nobody has dug in to figure out where they need to be. And we were talking--you've heard many illusions. We had a really in-depth conversation about preemption before we came out here-- </p><p>LEE: --I know. I was like please save some of this for the panel. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STEPANOVICH: But unless we start talking about what a real problems preemption is needed to solve and have really honest conversations, that conversation won't go any further. And getting back to my first point, that won't probably happen until we have a vehicle with actual language that allows people to dig into those issues and feel like they're not giving up on their position. And until then, it's going to be hard core digging into the ground and just waiting to see what happens. </p><p>LEE: Right. But I mean, I--I've got to just--as you answer, Morgan, I mean, we knew about California before California became California. We knew this law was coming and I think I had a coin toss with some friends in the EU who talked about they said do you think we're going to have federal privacy legislation before California? I thought I was going to win, but I'm not, right? Clearly. So-- </p><p>REED: Yeah, I--I--I always have to remember that nobody does anything until basically, you know, you're waking up and looking at the rope in the morning, right? it's--it's that kind of instinct that lives in DC of oh, we'll put it off and put it off, we'll put it off. I think though, there are two things. One of the things that came out of GDPR that still to this day is a bit of a problem and CCPA, and one of the reasons why preemption is important is even when there's areas that are true conflict, you can have overlapping requirements or overlapping build outs. And those favor larger institutions with larger collections of lawyers. </p><p>When you have a conversation, you know, working in the health space, which is what I lot of what I do on the health privacy space, it's very easy for large institutions to say well, first, you need to do DPO and then you need to have all of this documentation on how you're doing privacy by design on your health product, and then you need to do a complete six-month survey of your--of your data handling on--on--on health records. And mind you, this is before you ever stricken a single line of code, before you've written any part of your product, you have to--your first hire is not a programmer, it's a lawyer. </p><p>And that works in a large institution where it may be your health product is a skunk works project and you are borrowing from your--you're going to go to your general counsel and say hey, I need a--an FTE to work on this. But you are--if a five man start up who's making a product that a, it's a figures out a way to solve diabetic retinopathy, you probably got five MD PhD's focused on the problem and their first hire is not a doctor. So in some cases, the preemption question is not--is not strictly about aisle, you know, shoveling off liability risk, which I think some people do, they use preemption to push that off, but it's also, even when the law isn't truly conflicting where it creates multiple requirements. I often find that my larger company of friends are much more comfortable with that event my smaller company members who started as a hold on, what all do I have to do? So I think Amie's point about everybody coming to the table, and I think there's probably two elements to this, we talked preemption, the other one is private right of action. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>REED: And those two things are the anchor points of this fight where I don't think you're going to have a lot of people coming to the table. We talked about this earlier, all of us, about the fact that we all know in DC one of the things that happens is you don't want to give something up that you might want to give up later in the negotiation process. So preemption and private right of action are the ace cards, the--the--whatever you call it, the card that you're holding onto that you're not-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Trump card-- </p><p>REED: --Trump card really, yeah. </p><p>LEE: He said he wasn't going to say it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>REED: The trump card in this situation that people are holding onto. So Amie is completely right that there are-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Somebody get that on the record. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>REED: There are multiple senators in specific and some members of Congress and their--and as--and as you said, I think you hit the nail on the head where you said jurisdictional fights between energy and commerce and judiciary exists, but there's also preemption and private right of action, which unless we can find a way to come to the table on that, there--there is going to continue to be a problem. And I'll go back to my one of my original points. As much as I love tech and am from tech, I think retail will be driving a whole lot of this. </p><p>LEE: Well we--I definitely here at Brookings have seen more non-tech companies so--to step in the debate because what company is not tech? </p><p>REED: Everybody is tech. </p><p>LEE: That's part of the issue. I want to, because I always want to be mindful of people in the in terms of how far they are anti-they are in the debate, private right of action. Explain that to people, Morgan. </p><p>REED: Basically, can you hire an attorney to sue on your behalf. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>REED: And to sue a specific company on your behalf. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: So not the Attorney General. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: Bot the Federal Trade Commission, not--not a state agency, but you hire an attorney and go sue somebody. </p><p>LEE: That's right. And so Jamie, you know, sort of chiming you in there into this conversation, so what should we expect though as the new normal if CC--when CCPA actually gets passed? What's going to be our new scenarios? I mean, are we going to see more right to legal action by individuals, even if it's a person who wasn't even directly harmed by it? Are we going to see California sort of be the framing point for what federal privacy legislation should look like? Or are we going to just play out California with hopes that, you know, at some point something will happen, but we don't know what and when? </p><p>BOONE: I think it depends. It depends on, you know, the size of your company. </p><p>REED: Right. </p><p>BOONE: If you're a big player in California, you're obviously--you're going to focus there, and you're going to try and figure out how you comply with it because I think there's still a lot of unopened--unanswered questions there. There are still a lot of things that were left on the table. We mention retail a few times. The loyalty programs issue has still not--not been solved. That's been delayed until--until next year. We still need to see regs from the AG. </p><p>So the next couple months really and into next year, I think you're going to be dominated by reacting to California and figuring out how to deal with it. And then you also have GDPR. I mean, a lot of these companies that are big in California are also big internationally and are working to comply with GDPR. I mean, the ones that are big enough to have it be worth it I think, you know, I was reading the other day there are 1000 different U.S. news sources that have just stopped operating in Europe because it's--it's too uncertain and it cost too much to comply or to try to comply with GDPR. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>BOONE: So reacting to those two things and then, you know, something if we have a bill to react to may be will bring us back to the federal stage. But right now, the feds aren't saying anything, so we're getting kind of pushed out of the conversation. </p><p>REED: I do want to make one point though that you made. You said big. One of the problems with data is big is not what you think it is. A good example is one of our members did the first sideways keyboard on the iPhone. He has 2.8 million users. He's one guy in--in Oregon and he wrote an app. Yet another guy who does Montessori apps for kids. Montessori apps. He's got 1.5 million users on his--on multiple products. And so big is not big when it comes to data sets. My guys who are in the IOT space, they all have literally billions of data points that they have in their--in their collection, and they can be a five-man shop. So that's why you have to watch out on big because, as you know, big--big is about the data set, not necessarily about the company. </p><p>LEE: Did you want to say something, Amie? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Well, it's also about the sensitivity. And going back-- </p><p>LEE: --Yes. Yes-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --To specifically the health sector, I mean, I think there are definitely going to be places where people are okay saying maybe I don't want somebody rushing to the market to try to collect 2.5 billion data sets before they thought through these issues. I think some of this is a growing pains issue for the smaller companies. We are at--and had we had privacy legislation in this country or comprehensive--like GDPR style legislation 10 years ago, we have gone through this already. </p><p>LEE: Right, right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: There would have been a pain point, we would have figured it out. Third parties, largely, I think, are going to come in and do a lot of this the same way they do with employee records and paychecks and other things and we have a system in place. We are using the promise of an inevitable pain point when a law passes to keep a law from getting past and that means we are never going to get through that which means were actually creating larger pain points down the road when there are more companies who can do more things who are further entrenched in a system that doesn't have a federal privacy law. Whereas, if we do it now, it's lesser. If we did it 10 years ago, it would've been even-- </p><p>LEE: --Right-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Easier-- </p><p>LEE: --Because--right. That's right-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --And so we--we keep pushing it back and making it harder, I think, on ourselves. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. I mean, this brings up, and I think you saw, for those of you that are here, you saw sort of embedded in this conversation is, again, the broader dialogue against around process implementation. We really haven't gotten into enforcement, but I think we've actually talked about enforcement a lot in the general public, right? But I am curious as we look at these verticals of healthcare or cloud-based applications and other software, you know, how do we think, you know, privacy legislation will actually impact, I think, Morgan, going back to what you talk about, companies that are small or medium-size, startups? You know, where do we see that conversation happening as we sort of look at, you know, device makers and others who are in this space either directly or indirectly? </p><p>REED: So both the App Association and CTA have been working on some of these questions in this space. One of the hard parts in working on digital medicine and digital health is sometimes de-identified information is not good. What I mean by that is to solve the problem. Here's the construct, when you see a physician in your life, if you see your physician at what you consider the top of their game, they will have seen about 29,000 patients give or take. But the number of patients that they will have seen with your comorbidity, your genotype, your genetic makeup, your age, your family history, your everything else, you're lucky if you have a physician that's seen 100 people with your exact makeup. And so that puts the physician in the--in the unenviable position of having to make a decision about your treatment based on what they remember from medical school, a club couple of classes that they've attended, and 100 data points. </p><p>Now, there's none of you in this room who do business and make life or death decisions on 100 data points over--over that kind of stretch. So one of the things that digital medicine has the promise to do by using large data sets is to start to say oh, women of Irish descent tend to react better to this or if the person has this disease and this comorbidity, we actually find this medication treats them better. My wife, who is a doctor, but of another type, she now works on epidemiology issues, she's always right to point out to me that most of the medical--medicine testing has been done on men. Even when these women--even though the medication is assigned to women. And my wife is like why is this--why is this medication being offered up without the back--the concomitant research. </p><p>And so large data sets and large--in some of these cases where we have very personable, very personal, very direct is the only way we'll discover it. And your point, information that's why we--we would agree when it comes to health information, we need to be thoughtful about how we move forward. The real question is going to be is what's considered health information? </p><p>LEE: Right. And what's considered personal? </p><p>REED: Well, health, like what you eat, where you live, your-- </p><p>LEE: --Right. Right-- </p><p>REED: --All that stuff-- </p><p>LEE: --Within that, yeah-- </p><p>REED: --Starts to be the thing. It's less about treating the diseases that we know. It's about finding the solutions to the diseases that we don't have an answer for yet. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: But medical testing is-- </p><p>REED: --Yeah-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Privacy law will not impact who they test the medicine on-- </p><p>LEE: --Right. Morgan, you've been outnumbered on this panel-- </p><p>REED: --Actually-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --To solve that, why are we moving forward with gigantic potential privacy invasions if the actual underlying practices that have nothing to do with privacy like who is actually included in these medical tests, we can't solve for it--let's get that stuff out of the way. </p><p>REED: Actually, that's the part of the school. The FDA and Bakul Patel at the FDA and others are working on precertification programs and others so that we can actually do more with large data sets. The FDA--I'm here to actually say great things about a government agency. The FDA is actually putting a lot of effort into exactly that question, which is how do we pull larger data sets in? They got a whole AI project around this and a lot of it is public pressure. And I would encourage people to write, you know, encourage them to put pressure on the FDA and your members of Congress because there is--there is the thought inside of the FDA, which is how do we get more information. </p><p>And if you sit down with CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and they have CMMI, which does the research in the space, CMMI--we went to go meet with them. They say to get a research project out of CMMI will take 10 years. Well, 10 years ago we didn't even have smart phones. So unlocking some of these data sets will actually be key to empowering the FDA and companies to make good applications and to show the effectiveness. So it overlaps and I'm hopeful that we can solve the problem you're outlining by giving them better data. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, well-- </p><p>REED: --Because that's part of the problem. Sorry. </p><p>LEE: Yeah--no. I think--I think that's a good point. I mean, I think both of you-- </p><p>REED: --I didn't mean to jump on that one. It's my favorite topic. </p><p>LEE: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I mean, Amie, I share a similar peace with algorithms, you know, where we are actually looking at trading data sets that are, you know, largely male. But I don't want to go there. That's another event. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Okay, we had an event like that a couple months ago. I'm not going to go down that alley again. But I do want to talk a little bit about though go back into this--these nuanced verticals, right, where having access to personal information will matter. I'm not sure to the extent of how much that information has to be personally identifiable, but there may be cases, particularly the case of people of color where you'd want to know what some of those genetic markers are so that you actually have better access to solutions. And if they're underrepresented, that's a problem on the bat (PH). But you know, I'm always curious as we go down this road of privacy legislation, are we going to forget how to nuance that? One from the big company that may be providing that service like Apple where you can get a lot of health data, but in two from smaller companies that are heavily relying on the big companies-- </p><p>REED: --To process the data sets-- </p><p>LEE: --For data flows. Exactly. So I'm just curious, you know, I'll go, Jamie, to you. I mean, CTA, this is part of your business, right? Empowering these new innovations. </p><p>BOONE: Absolutely. </p><p>LEE: To what extent should we be jumping into that conversation on how privacy law will affect these third--third areas or these third ways? Yeah. </p><p>BOONE: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think health and wellness devices is an area that, you know, we've had a couple of years now, but it's been an area of huge growth and innovation and how you can use these different tools. You can use--you can use virtual reality to help with health monitoring and how you can help deal with therapies or how you can use different trackers to help look for certain markers that may, you know, indicate that, hey, your, you know, your blood pressure is way higher than it normally is. Maybe you should call the doctor, you should go to the doctor. And building those in the first place, yeah, it requires data. You have to know what you're building toward. And how you define, because you've mentioned personal information, and you've mentioned private information or sensitive information, definitions in this debate are so important. </p><p>REED: Oh, yeah. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>BOONE: And I mean, half of the amendments that just went through on CCPA were all about the definition of personal information. As you know, what--what are exemptions, what is--what is personal, what is--what isn't--what--what is sensitive or risky, what isn't? And I think we're kind of missing--what we're missing a little bit from this conversation is how it's--how that impacts harm. Like, what the--what is the harm to consumers and, you know, how do you draw that line is something always sensitive. </p><p>Is geolocation data always sensitive? It is, you know, is gender always--what--X, Y, or Z, is it always sensitive? Do you always treated the same way, or does it depend on the application? I think that that's a question that still kind remains to be answered, and we're starting to just see--we started to dig into the weeds more on that just with California, but I think that we'd be remised to forget that </p><p>LEE: Yeah, Amie, I know you--do you want to jump in on this one? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I think the other side is what's never sensitive. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Oftentimes, you hear name, phone number, address. There are things that are given, it's like not sensitive information, but you start putting those into databases together and then adding other things that you might think are not sensitive, and you start painting a really full sensitive picture of somebody's life based solely on publicly available data. And in an era of machine learning, the distinction just becomes almost nonsensical. Eight years ago, there was a machine learning paper that said with two location points-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>REED: --Oh, I remember this-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --You can identify somebody exactly who they are. Just to random location points. We are getting better and better at figuring out sensitive information from what many might consider non-sensitive. And I would say, like, this distinction is actually becoming less meaningful-- </p><p>LEE: --Right-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Over time because all of that information going into a common center and being analyzed means we--we know every--we probably know more about people than people know about themselves. </p><p>LEE: But I--Morgan, feel free to jump in. So this is interesting. I was at a conference on last week for--NSF was actually hosting this. It was interesting, we were talking about location data. You know, a couple of years ago we would have this conversation on location data, we were all up in arms around that in terms of our privacy. Today, you apply that to certain applications, and we are mad if they don't know where we're at because there are several applications that rely upon that location data, whether it's a navigation system, it's a ridesharing service, it's something. </p><p>You know, are we--and I'll just throw this out as a question. I don't think of us this question to any panel. Are we sort of over analyzing what consumers need and want versus what they're using? Do you see what I mean? Like, in this privacy discussion that's pretty much caught up by us, are we forgetting that some of these things consumers actually want their data used for? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: So this is the Uber question. A few years ago it turned out there were--there were three options at that point in time for an app to collect your location data on the iPhone. There was always, never, and while using the app. And people were using while using the app and they were getting information after they closed the app, so they were able to go a little bit further. And people were really not happy with that. Yes, they might want you to have their location information at certain points in time. Few people want every app loop tracking their location all of the time or beyond where they think they can track you. </p><p>And so we need to be able to approach it in that--again, back to the nuance of what the people want and are you giving them the option? I want to be able to enter my address sometimes into a place and not have the app know where I am. Do I have the option to do that? In some cases, that's not true, in some cases it is. Why can't people make that decision for themselves? And if they do want it, then they have the option of turning it on. </p><p>REED: I think the problem, and again, Amie is 100% right, there you go. The second time. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEE: On video. </p><p>REED: On video. I think the problem-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Three times and the panel explodes. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>REED: The problem is is that, and this is something that's very sensitive to my community, it's the whole kind of the third-party use question on where we go because, as you say, do you--you said, you know, do consumers relate--do they really want it used. And to Amie's point, they want it used in the way they have the expectation of it. And for those of you who know Lorrie Cranor who is at the FTC has written a lot about do people actually have that fulsome knowledge of not--not with the immediate use is, but what happens next and what happens after that and at what happens after that? And that's where, as Amie pointed out, you get these--these vertical silos of data built. And that creates trouble. The flip side of it is my community depends on third-party toolsets to do a lot of things. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: Third-party analytics are a big part of how a smaller company can compete with bigger companies because it ties you into things, it gives you access to a lot of other information, and kind of the--the bogeyman in the room on all of this is--is interspaced advertising because that drives a lot of the conversation that may be separate and apart from--from what the expectation is. As you said, right, if some but he says I only want it on when I'm using the app but, the app monetizes through interest-based advertising, well then the app company says this gets back to who is the customer, right? If it's monetized through advertising, you're not really the customer. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: So from the app's perspective, they need that information and so their attitude is well, no, I need that because otherwise I can provide you the service you want. And your point is-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>REED: --This is that question about where consumers sit, right? How--how much--how much convenience they want for a free application that's monetized through the use of their data? And then, do they really know what all of those things are? And that's I think where we as an industry have still not succeeded-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>REED: --And that is helping them to understand all of those uses. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, and I think as, I mean as, and from a layperson's perspective, and particularly when I've done this book tour and ask people about privacy, I think it's this concern of consumers that we become the product, right, and not having control over what does that actually mean, as you talked about before. But I think going back to the first conversation of why we are still here is because representatives are trying to take that consumer experience and figure out ways to make that into legislation where they can actually have bipartisan support. And everybody has a different angle and where they're coming into the conversation. </p><p>BOONE: Yeah, and if I can just add to that, I think that, you know, obviously transparency and choice are--are important and key and we should be considering that-- </p><p>LEE: --That's right-- </p><p>BOONE: --But what we need to think about, too, is the cases when it's not clear, who's data it really is. Facebook put out an interesting picture, or a paper last week that was focused on data portability and started to lay out some of the more in-depth questions of how we deal with data portability and what it is and what it means. And I thought one of the most interesting questions was whose data is it if you want to--if, you know, I have my contacts in a service and I want to move that to another service, is it just my data that that is or is it the people that it's their contact information? </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>BOONE: Do they need--have they already, you know, given approval for me to do whatever I want with the data once I have it in the first place or not, and whose responsibility is that? So there's really interesting edge cases that I think will start to see more of is receipt--as we get further into the implementation of California that are hard to think right off the bat when you're trying to legislate on it, but then come up later as oak, that's a really good point. I actually don't know the answer to that and what does that mean? </p><p>LEE: What are you showing us, Morgan? </p><p>REED: When GDPR first came out, one of the questions we asked is if I hand you my business card, does that equal consent? </p><p>BOONE: Well, I'll take it. </p><p>LEE: No, give it to me. </p><p>REED: There we go. Does she--in other words-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Now the question is-- </p><p>BOONE: Now I can give it to Nicol. </p><p>REED: Right. And exactly. So the physical business cards, because GDPR doesn't just cover the digital, you know, the--the email transaction or anything like that, it's a physical business card. And the question that we ask various DPAs and others were if I hand over a business card, is that--does that mean I'm assenting to them taking my information and putting it in my contacts and then, if that context as a service, does that mean I can go to LinkedIn and pull my data out even a I--because I don't want you to have it, even though I gave you a business card, which most people would say is consent. So it's--it's fascinating to think about even in physical space and how that will end up being represented. </p><p>BOONE: Yeah, absolutely. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Well, and this is--these are conversations we can have and solve for. </p><p>LEE: That's right. That's right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: We know these are going to be problems. Why aren't we digging into conversations--that level of nuance? Before I left, we were talking about what types of data should someday be able to access when they exercise their right to access, which is one of the rights under the GDPR, it's something that you see in CCPA. Should you be able to access the information you've given, the information that's analyzed and determined about you for what you--like, what levels? It's going to be the same questions when you ask to erase information that's owned, when you ask to report. Where do those rights apply? </p><p>These are predictable, knowable questions that are going to have to be solved by legislation and things that we can talk about right now and figure out what the answers are to make sure that they not only work and are workable, but work 10 years in the future. Because, let's face it, if we do get a federal law, it will be at least 10 years before we're talking about this again, if ever. Thanks to California, we are having this conversation to begin with. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Let's not forget that when we decide to have really broad preemption that a state is the reason that this federal conversation has started happening. </p><p>LEE: Right. I--I'm going to go to questions in a few minutes. So if you have a question that is percolating in your mind, just write it down. But we will have some time for question and answer. Before I kind of give you all this chair of giving us a solution, I do want to bring in one other area, which is cybersecurity, right? Oftentimes, we are in privacy conversations, and just like that spoke analogy, cybersecurity either comes up or doesn't come up towards the top of the umbrella, right, in terms of the reason why we're having these conversations in the first place. Some legislators are sort of driving their involvement based on the cybersecurity aspect of it versus, you know, just general consumer privacy rights. Where do you think you're going to actually fall out with regards to the cyber conversation moving forward? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I think we will likely security as an aspect of privacy law. It'll probably say something along the lines of companies should implement reasonable security practices. </p><p>LEE: Right. Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Dear agency, figure out what that means. But the FTC's authority in this area has been gutted recently because of a lawsuit challenging one of their actions, so we need to have some indication back. And I think in some of the questions in security and some of the questions and privacy, we're going to start to see overlap. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: We know, and I talked about this one insecurity--on security panels, rarely on privacy panels, we know what to do if our credit card information gets breached. Like, how many of you have gotten notice that your credit card information was breached? </p><p>LEE: How many--how many multiple times? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Yeah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You get your identity fraud protection probably from the company that had it stolen, you change your credit card number, it's really inconvenient for about three months because all this auto pays that you had set up have to be reset up again, but you know how to figure it out. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: If your photos on your phone got hacked into, nobody really knows from a personal operational matter what to do. How do you even respond to more personal information getting breached? And we're going to have to figure out that from a privacy perspective as well. How do people connect to this nonfinancial information and what is the harm that derives from that? And those are really hard conversations because a lot of that is emotional, mental-- </p><p>LEE: --Right-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Long-term, unable to come back from it emotional, mental. But it's not the I have $5 stolen from my bank account or $5000 or $5 million. </p><p>LEE: That's right. I was going to bring up something, but go ahead. You might say it. </p><p>REED: Yeah, Maury Muehleisen (PH) has done some work on this and Paula Bruning (PH), who many of you know, is also somebody looking at this exact question on, those of you who are in the legal sphere, you've heard harms theory and this question of how it does--how does the FTC take action. And so it's been very interesting to see, you know, both of those are former FTC people with inside knowledge of how it works and how do you construct something that creates a harms framework when you don't have a direct monetary harm? I think--I think the other part though, which is important, is, and you touched a bit on this on the control idea is part of giving people back some authority over their data is making sure that it is--that it is theirs and that they have some sense of how it's controlled. So we are fierce advocates for encryption, and-- </p><p>LEE: --I was going to say--I was going to say the encryption word. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>REED: Right. I mean, all of that stuff is supercritical to providing some sense of self, some sense of ownership because it also makes a clear pathway for breaches. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>REED: Because if it's encrypted and it's something that I don't have--I haven't given the holder of that, the person who's--holding that container and I haven't given them permission to access, then if there is a data breach on their end and it's encrypted, then my risk is less. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>REED: So I think--I think there is a tendency for people to--because back privacy, the number one thing that people--when we do focus groups on privacy, what they're really afraid about is identity theft. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>REED: It's weird, but when you ask people about privacy, what are you concerned about on privacy, well I'm afraid my data is going to be stolen. And then you have to be like that's actually identity theft. We're talking about privacy. And--and I don't think the general consumer feels that those are separated as those of us that are in the debate do. </p><p>BOONE: Absolutely. I agree with that 100 percent. I think there's a lot of confusion on the part of consumers on what is security or cybersecurity versus what is privacy. And they do get mixed in together. I--I don't think there will be a large security component to privacy bill, more because of the political history of--of that. </p><p>LEE: Right. Right. </p><p>BOONE: You know, we've been trying to get data breach notification uniform national standard and that data--with the security standard for 20 years now. </p><p>LEE: I was going to say (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>BOONE: --Always because of this, you know, going back to that conversation we had on preemption, everyone goes back to their corners. And especially when it comes to the breach notification, which means retail and cloud providers and banks, pulling that whole component on top of this already very complex privacy debate I think has the potential to pull the whole thing down. </p><p>LEE: That's right. That's right. Well, and does that mean that, and kind of going back to my first question--and again, in about six minutes I'll go to questions. Does that mean that all of these new areas, and I kind of go back to the same question I started with, it's just going to make it much more difficult to get to consensus, or, and this is my, you know, rock 'n' roll question here, are there 3 areas, if you were able to go to legislators and say stop worrying about these 10 different things and focus on 3--and I'll give you an example. So six months ago, no one was talking about online bias and discrimination. Many of you who follow my work know that something that really is something important to me. </p><p>Now we're actually getting legislators to say it can be involved in privacy legislation, but maybe it's not as extensive. We can actually follow up when we get into broader AI implications on that. But at least, you know, one of the things I've been putting out there is update the nondiscrimination laws and place those three sentences around that in privacy legislation and move on. Right? Not sure if it's going to happen, but it's something I publicly have said. Three things that may get us closer to legislation. Amie? I know there's a lot of conversations. It's it almost sounds like my dining room table. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Actually, I'm going to take the opportunity to think a little bit more by making one point because a lot of you guys are privacy people in the room-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --And not security people and encryption was said. And just an FYI, like, encryption is not always the same. There are different forms-- </p><p>LEE: --Different levels of (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Strengths, levels. So the writing, like, if data is encrypted, none of this has to take place as a safe harbor, not all created equal. So love to use that as an education moment. </p><p>LEE: Got to get that out of your system. </p><p>REED: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>STEPANOVICH: So three things. I actually think looking at the beyond consent looking to think--reasons to process data, the legal basis for processing data is a big thing to get to because it's cross areas and it's something to really dig into that can go beyond sectors. What are the things that we need to provide as legal basis, and what is too broad? Because I think if you talk to the privacy people in Europe, the legitimate basis is like a copout and was a huge back door to needing a legal basis to--to get information. And if you talk to the other side, there like this is way too narrow and we need a lot more of a reason, and that was another big schism. And so digging into that area I think is huge. The lawyer's committee has a civil rights-based privacy law-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah, yeah-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --That uses that different privacy rights and then incorporates civil rights protections. I think looking at that in greater depth is going to be super important. To Nicol's point, I think that's something I--I care about really deeply as well. And getting those protections in is going to be important. And then, going--getting beyond the exceptions piece, so rather than a thing that we need to concentrate on, it's getting past needing to have an exception for every single industry or non-industry or sector or size of a company and--as opposed to that getting to a place where we have a law that doesn't need 50,000 exceptions and is workable and will protect people's privacy into the future when more and more data is going to be collected. I think that the argument about exceptions in the California law went right up to the 11th hour about how many people wanted things and even now still, there trying to go back and get more written in. </p><p>LEE: Right, yeah. Morgan? </p><p>REED: I think what Amie said about the exceptions is really interesting and something that we've--that we differently pushed back on. You'd expect the small business people to say we need a small business exception, but that's proven to be very risky. I think you're right. So one of the things that was really telling as at a Senate hearing about the GDPR, they had Google and Apple and Facebook at the hearing, and they asked each of them how much time did you spend to comply? I think Google said hundreds of person years of legal time to comply. And the other companies all followed suit. And--and there was another panel where Garmin, which is actually a pretty small company-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>REED: --They said they spent hundreds of person months on compliance, for a person the size of Garmin. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: And so I think--I think Amie is right. Making sure that it's not a bill filled with exceptions, because my community actually deals with large data sets where it doesn't matter how many employees they have, I think you have to have a bill that deals with the size and scope and impact of the data set as--as much as the size of the company. I think that's--I think that's going to be something we've got to deal with to right size it. I think the second part, you said three, the second part is, and this is a bit blasphemous, and I know I don't have full support for this, but I think most everybody here knows that HIPAA is not actually a privacy law. The P and HIPAA stands for portability, not privacy. It-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --And there's one P. </p><p>REED: And it's one P, right. </p><p>LEE: It's one P. </p><p>REED: (INAUDIBLE) affordability. It is about--and--and here's a funny little anecdote on this. Unless your doctor actually files electronic insurance--electronic insurance claims, technically HIPAA doesn't apply. Like, concierge doctors who never file an electronic insurance claims, theoretically aren't actually covered. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: I mean, it's--it's an absurdist treatment of it, but it tells you something about the fact that high-tech act and the changes to HIPAA are really a tail wagging the dog because HIPAA was about providing portability for patients and getting access to. And if you meet with ONC, they'll talk about how do we utilize this law to provide better interoperability between EHRs, all that kind of stuff. So when I look at HIPAA, I want to--back to this cross sectoral, do we have an umbrella, I don't know that we want a law that guts HIPAA. I don't think I could ever get that passed. But I think Amie is onto something when you say that it needs to kind of not deal with 5000 except--did you say 50,000 exceptions? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I don't know remember. </p><p>REED: Ninety nine thousand exceptions. I think she's right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Seventy eight. </p><p>LEE: Right, pick a number. </p><p>REED: Pick a number. </p><p>LEE: Right, exactly. </p><p>REED: I think we have to find a way to be true to what the person is looking for, which is some sense of what's happening with their data that they have some recourse if the data is misused or used in a way they didn't intend that they have some ability to--to be engaged in how their data is used, but ultimately that it still provides companies some perspective and leeway to, if I deidentify it, if I aggregate it, that I can still make use of it without that thread being pulled and then my entire algorithm falling apart. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>REED: So I think--I think those are two, I think she's right, has to be--it has to be sized for all, no except--no tons of exceptions, and watch out for financial or healthcare where we may be misusing existing laws in a way that prevents it. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, just on that, because those have been the use cases that have sort of been triggered, right? </p><p>REED: Yeah. </p><p>LEE: Versus the other one. So that's an interesting way to look at it. Jamie? </p><p>BOONE: I think were actually going to get privacy legislation-- </p><p>LEE: --Yeah, I was going to say you're talking--this is Congress, okay? </p><p>BOONE: Do you just need something to react to? </p><p>BOONE: What three things can we actually give Congress? This is Congress. </p><p>BOONE: Yes. Give us something to react to. A draft would be really helpful, even if it's a fashion (PH) draft. Give us something that we can actually get people to the table because-- </p><p>REED: --Yeah-- </p><p>BOONE: --You know, I think all sides of this debate are interested in how having this conversation. I mean, industry for sure, we're ready. We want to move something forward. We--we see the train coming across the country from different states on, you know, what they're going to do on their own if Congress doesn't do something. So let's go. But you know, barring that, I think it's going to take time and time, one, just because of the nature of the congressional schedule, and that it being an election year, and also time to see the implantation of California and react to that, and then time to see how other states try and fill the gap, and then what--where we're at. </p><p>I'm so curious to see where we're going to be in two years. How many other states have something and how much they conflict or build or if, you know, they all just build right on top of the California model? Do they take the same--there's a lot of unknowns out there and I think in two years we can be in a very different place. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, I mean, it's like sort of reminds me, and I were going to go to Q&amp;A, but last night I made a really good macaroni and cheese. </p><p>REED: How any cheeses did you use? </p><p>LEE: And when you make macaroni and cheese, you put in the pasta, you put in the egg, you put in the milk, you put in the cheese-- </p><p>REED: --Cheeses-- </p><p>LEE: --Cheeses, right, because you got to have the sharp cheddar baked in and then the shredded on the top, that's how I make it. And then the end result is it's either good or it's bad based on how long you cook it. I had to bring it up because my daughter ate about three helpings of this. But when I think about this debate, I think about that macaroni and cheese I made last night because it just seems to me that we all have the right recipe, but we don't have the right actors around the table and the right issues and the right temperature, maybe that's the congressional climate to actually get stuff done. </p><p>And my fear is, and the reason I ask this security question again to tee up your questions, I think consumers are also somewhat getting it conflated, particularly as this election comes through in terms of what their privacy means, in terms of the public domain of voting and other things. And I think we've got to get it straight before, you know, we get into a place where we get into the next stage of issues, which we have not even yet determined what they are. So we're going to take some Q and A. Raise your hand if you have a question. I'd say just identify yourself and keep your question so I can take as many as possible. So we'll start on the side of the room. We got some generous time for Q and A, so if you do have a burning question for the panel, please ask. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. My name is Deborah Ray (PH). I'm a graduate student at the University of Maryland, and I'd like to know more about what is being said in the conversation about two points. So the first point is not just a private right to action but private incentive to act because, you know, just the way the legal framework is set up, you know, it's not enough to just have the right to take somebody to court, you need to be able to go after punitive damages. You need to be able to minimize the, you know, risk of, you know, walking away with nothing at the end of it. So we do need that private incentive to act, especially, I mean, our Constitution is basically a symbol because it is too difficult to actually enforce our rights. And even if we did, it is too difficult to go after damages and hold the government accountable. </p><p>So the other point that I like to know more about is infrastructure as a service. My understanding is that companies may begin to start sharing data amongst each other, common data. And just the fact that another company owns the data's information as itself, you are saying before that to location pieces is enough to identify someone. Two locations where data exists, that could be enough to, you know, come back and gain too much insight into the person. So I just want to know what you have to say about those. </p><p>LEE: Who would like to take this question? </p><p>REED: Well, I'll--one thing, you used the term too much information. I think I personally prefer the idea of unexpected because what we keep running into is those of us who are privacy nags have a tendency to be like you shouldn't do this and you don't do this, but then when you watch consumer behavior and consumer expectations, it's--it's actually they're like no, I want this or I need this or I don't want it to--I don't want a lot of friction in the system. COPPA, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act has a ton of friction. Parents don't like it. It's hard to get verifiable parental consent. So what you're really looking for is instead of too much but is it unexpected. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: I think--I think there's a point there. On the first point, I'd like you to take it because this is your space, but I think punitive damages for just general--for general non-malfeasance is going to be hard. If you don't have intent, I can't imagine that. </p><p>BOONE: No, and I'm not a lawyer, so I want to jump too far down that rabbit hole. But I actually wanted to go to your second point first, which is I see this assumption of harm in your question and I--I--there are a lot of data points. Take ridesharing, for example. We were seeing a lot of requests from city and local governments for the data that right sharing companies have. That could be used by the city then to improve services. So I--I want to challenge a little bit that assumption that because there is a lot of data or because there are a certain number of data points that it's going to be used against someone. </p><p>I think that there--it's important to have guardrails on how you use that data and how, you know, how a city uses that data, how the data is shared, but I don't like the assumption that it's just because there's a lot of it it's bad because there's a lot of positive users there. So I think the use and intent there is really important. Private right of action, that's one of--one of the two, like we started with earlier, those two topics that I think are going to be--those are the hardest to solve for in this debate in Congress, and this is one where everyone is going to be in their corners until we get to that last point of, like, we're down to this last issue of whether or not we're going to get a bill and where do we come--where do we end up on that. And I think that probably is going to go more toward the middle than further--further to the left. </p><p>LEE: Amie. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Yeah, I just want to underscore I think the importance of your first point, especially for certain communities. I apologize if what I'm about to discuss makes people uncomfortable, I feel like I need to say that. I did a lot of work a few years ago on the security implications of Internet connected adult intimate devices and they are collecting--it's an industry collecting more and more information, and it was a weird place where potential victims of these devices getting hacked were getting shame, victim blamed on two sides. You didn't have enough security, and also, you use this device to begin with, and how dare you. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: For certain communities, the information that is being collected and the potential for them to be pigeonholed or shamed is quite great, and that's why a lot of people I think want to have a private right of action built in and to have some of those incentives for them to come forth and file challenges because the potential negative pieces of having themselves involved in these conversations are quite great for those communities, and that's where that importance really comes from. And so just to underscore that and to really pull it out of what tends to be a fairly privileged conversation in Washington DC to say there are other people involved as well who have very, very different threat models that they're facing. </p><p>LEE: That's right. Thank you. Let's go to the second question. Right over here. And then I'll work in this room and then I'll come on the side, okay? </p><p>QUESTION: Great. Jill DeGraff (PH) from Aperture Law Group. I am curious if in the health data sector we could actually, you know, a way I think about it is whether the great privacy complex will actually agree not to have a comprehensive bill in favor of something that's just focused on health data outside of HIPAA. And--and one reason I think about that is that we did have bipartisan support for passage of the 21st cures act, which in turn was promoting data interoperability. We are now facing a challenge where there has to be data that will be flowing freely portability wise to consumers, but into the great unknown of--of third-party apps. And so there is some urgency, and I just wonder whether you think we could peel that off and iterate on it. </p><p>LEE: Morgan. </p><p>REED: Well, we know that ONC, and I'm sure given where you work you know this, I mean, ONC has been kind of raising these questions. There is a--there's a--not a rule, it's not a notice of proposed rulemaking. I'm forgetting the ONC version of this where they've--they've asked for input on that exact question. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: Notice of inquiry? </p><p>REED: Yeah, it's a notice of inquiry. Thank you. Yeah too many acronyms in this town. So there is a notice of inquiry on that exact question on how do we do portability post 21st century cures, and that was--she's exactly right, that was part of what was kind of tried to be teased out. I think the problem that we keep finding, and I mentioned this earlier, is what is health data, right? When you start to move into clinical support software, that's an FDA-ish term right around--around data sets that actually provide decisions for physicians. </p><p>When you're starting to gather a lot of these data, you may have data in there that might not be traditionally covered. And so this question of does data that goes into your EHR, you know, traditionally we just say oh, well if it goes to a covered entity, then it's data that's covered by HIPPA, but what if I'm taking data sets from an EHR that are part--there provided by a covered entity and that I'm overlaying it with data sets that I purchased from, say, Giant, right, Giant and I won't location data overlaid on it to see if there's a nutritional--if there is a nutritional deficit there or is there something else in the environment that's causing it. I think the hard part with a standalone data to try to help interoperability will be--I don't remember if it was Amie or--or who said it, if it was you, talked about the definitions aspect. </p><p>LEE: Yeah. </p><p>REED: I think the hard part in that fight is going to be about defining what is health data-- </p><p>LEE: --Right-- </p><p>REED: --Because there are going to be things that sound like edge cases that aren't so edge case that are going to make this harder to define. But it's a great question and it is something that I know everybody is trying to figure out. How do we get that portability and interoperability in an environment where HIPAA may actually impede? </p><p>LEE: And--and just on that health data question, moderator privilege, it is interesting to because it's health data defined by diagnoses or, you know, treatment versus health data like my apps that help me manage my calories that I think are keeping me, you know, \"more fluid health data\" that could actually be implicated, I think in any privacy legislation I think is one areas. </p><p>REED: That's right. </p><p>BOONE: And if I could just jump in on that as well, so CTA, we actually have a lot of health and wellness members, device makers and app makers. We actually recently just put out a health and fitness privacy guidelines for our member companies that, you know, our members came together to say, you know, to explain, you know, what the expectations are for--for that data that's in the in between that is not HIPPA data that is--you know. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>BOONE: So I think there is--there is obviously action in the industry to address that issue because there are definitely consumer concerns and questions around that. But when it comes to actual legislation, I don't think splitting out pieces-- </p><p>LEE: --Right-- </p><p>BOONE: --Is where this will go because once you start pulling it off, then you start--than the next person wants their issue pulled out and then there's a whole thing-- </p><p>REED: --Data services-- </p><p>BOONE: --Falls apart. So I think it'll--it's either--it's all or nothing at this point. </p><p>LEE: Yeah, next question? Okay, I'll take one question from here and then I'll take one question from here. I'm going to move over here, so this young man next. So we have another mic, right over here this gentleman. Raise your hand. Just so we can get the mic near you. Okay, perfect. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Alyssa Haslett with the Cohen Group. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential impacts of privacy laws on the--on companies operating in the transportation sector, so specifically, autonomous vehicles and connected car services. </p><p>BOONE: Yeah, my favorite topic. No, I've done a lot of work on self-driving. So--and this is one area where I've actually been very focused and very interested to see how those--how the privacy side of the debate and the self-driving side come together. And one--one point that came up when I was raising this with my members working in the space is facial recognition technology. So there was, earlier this year, Senators Blunt and Schatz had a draft facial recognition bill that they were floating around. And as those--as it was gathering feedback from my members, I had a couple of different vehicle tech members say this could have a really negative impact on future uses for self-driving vehicles and from two different aspects. One from--just from the--the vision of the vehicle and recognizing people versus animals or a tree trunk or whatever else is out there. </p><p>But two, if you're--if you're thinking about self-driving as a, you know, being the basis for future ridesharing, if your, okay, you're going and you're getting your self-driving Uber, there's no one in it to identify that it's you that should be getting in the vehicle. I would imagine, and a lot of my company is just thinking about, you know, how do we use--do we use facial recognition technology to acknowledge that that's the right person who's getting in the right car and going to the right place, which is going to be very important when there's no one--there's no driver. </p><p>LEE: Without a doubt. That's right. </p><p>BOONE: So if you're the user and that you are in Uber, your fine if you already consented. You know, you have the--the information and disclosures of how the information is being used. What--how does impact someone that it's not their Uber and they go up and they just, you know, want to take a look in and be like oh, what's this, and they haven't consented. You know, can the Uber even scan your face to check if you haven't opted in? What are the consent mechanisms there and what are the disclosure mechanisms there? So there's definitely going to be some interesting edge cases--edge cases like that as well that, and you could do this for any sector across the economy. When you pick something like that like oh, I haven't thought about that before where there is just going to be these--these kind of weird questions looking to the future. </p><p>LEE: And--did you want to add to the facial recognition? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I have an interesting story actually. About five years ago, I was at a conference, and I can't say--it was under a certain rule, so I can't talk about the identification, but somebody from a car company was saying well, we collect this data in this data in this data in this data, and somebody asked if they could have like a private driving mode, much like you have a private browser mode, where the driver could opt to turn off all of those different types of data collection. And the person from the company was clearly appalled and there like how could you turn off this data collection? It's not safe to drive without it. And somebody at my table with me, because it's a group of privacy people, looks at me and was like, how do we drive for the last several--century? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: And I think, like, there is a potential for tech to enter in and do things, but we need to also think back to the fact that we done this for a really long time. What data do we need to collect? Like, what is the data that is absolutely necessary to collect in order to operate a driverless vehicle versus what is the optional stuff that we are adding on top of that, like facial recognition, where you could really enter a code to get into the door, much like people did with Zipcar--since Zipcar was created? People may want that extra facial recognition like some people may want to look at their phone and have it unlocked, but other people might not. Where are the optional data categories? </p><p>LEE: That's right. Well, if I can, because were doing a lot of work on AI and facial rec, the other thing I would think that is also coming to that privacy ledge, this is kind of goes back to my earlier point about how strong is the umbrella to withstand the storms of innovation because if you look at facial recognition as it's being debated outside of privacy, there's a call to ban it. And if that call to ban it happens, then what does that look like when it comes to privacy legislation or are you really talking about maybe data minimization because that faces that are being collected may be phases that are not accurate or technically there are still some problems? </p><p>So the latest case I heard on facial recognition on autonomous vehicles, I hate to--to crack a little thing about this, but I think it's sort of what we've been talking about all day is because the technology is flawed in recognizing darker skin hues-- </p><p>REED: --Oh, yeah-- </p><p>LEE: --The likelihood of African-Americans to be hit by that autonomous vehicle is as likely as hitting a tree trunk because the technology is not refined. And so again, this goes back to all of these different areas of technology that are being overlaid and created in the midst of the discussion of legislation and how deep do we go, right, before we actually come up with something that we can live with that won't implode other parts of the economy? Or are those conversations happening marginal to this that will find themselves in privacy legislation? Are you all following me? This--this is like a continuous flow of conversation, which is why we're still talking about it. All right, that was my little moderator soapbox. I want to open it up for more questions. Let's go to this gentleman and will take one more question on the side and then will wrap up. </p><p>QUESTION: Hey. Dan Murphy from the Financial Health Network. </p><p>LEE: Put it closer. Okay, yeah. </p><p>QUESTION: Dan Murphy from the Financial Health Network. So I was a little surprised to hear you guys say that you don't think that this is going to break down a little bit more along verticals because it seems to me that's where a lot of the action actually is happening already. So Morgan, you alluded to the idea that all data sort of can be health data and the financial data ecosystem, all data, similarly, it can be credit data at the same time. We have a lot of laws around that, for FCRA, ACOA, and those conversations are happening in terms of, okay, of data is credit data? And so I'm just kind of curious what industries do you see as being ahead and why is it that you don't think that that action is going to happen before a national privacy law comes to fruition? </p><p>REED: Because you kind of pointed to it, with FCRA and a lot of these, if you look at other structured, a lot of them are harms based, right? You know, it has to do with the action of care credit. It has to do with the impact that it has on the person based and their ability to get a loan or get a--almost--almost all of those laws have a harms theory. And as we heard from the question over here and from her point about communities that are--are different, that may have different needs and where the harm might be something that isn't monetary, I think it makes it really hard to do that. </p><p>Health data is a good example. One of the areas that has been fascinating to work with on the health community we had a bunch of roundtables around this. Some patient advocacy groups are--are okay with privacy, but some of the fiercest advocates for not having privacy legislation are people whose children or family members are--have a disease that doesn't have a cure or a good treatment. Those people come to the table and basically say I don't care about your privacy, my child is dying, I need this--I need more information. They are zealous advocates for data because they have a family member that's dying, and they are insulted when you say how dare you do this. So don't forget that there are people for whom they see--I don't think that, you know, it's quite the same, but there's a problem with how that will all work because those people will come to the table and say if we have this narrow confine and this narrow construct around health data, what is its impact on orphan diseases or diseases that don't have good treatment mechanisms? </p><p>That, by the way, was back to--back to the problem with this, we all talk amongst ourselves, but until I sat down with the privacy groups, I mean, sorry, with patient advocacy groups, that's when I got--I got kind of coldcocked by I'd been in my own privileged healthy bubble with working with everything working and I'd never thought about the implications for people in that case. So I think it's hard because you will be surprised where some of the folks will come on--come from. And to your first question, most of the financial privacy space is dominated by harm. Does it hurt someone? And--and I think that's--it'll be hard to put that into the same context on health, or if we do, it will be--it will be interesting to see how we--because her point about private right of action, how do we monetize it, how do you--how do you make a--how do you make point about--seek monetary damages for that. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: Maybe we'll get it done, but that's why I think it'll be a little harder. </p><p>LEE: Jamie? </p><p>BOONE: Yeah, and I just want to clarify what I said earlier that I don't think, like, health will be split off to do--to be its own separate peace. I'm speaking specifically to legislation on the hill. I think in the lot of this verticals you just mentioned and others, there is a lot of work already going on and that will continue to go on on the regulatory side-- </p><p>REED: --Regulatory, yes-- </p><p>BOONE: --O on the industry side-- </p><p>REED: --She's right-- </p><p>BOONE: --Industry side--you know, industry, consensus side and guidelines and standards. Those things will definitely--will absolutely happen and continue to happen. I just don't think that Congress will start to split apart privacy into different verticals as opposed to a comprehensive practice. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: I mean, ultimately, this conversation is happening for, like, a handful of reasons, and one of them is the words that Nicol said at the beginning, Cambridge Analytica. And if we don't get a solution that solves all the way back for that and we stick in the verticals, I think people are going to see that we haven't done what we set out to do. And I think that's one of the reasons that we're going to continue on the comprehensive track. There are so many entities. Everything is tech. Are we solving for the problems when we re-narrow this back down. And I think we need to be having this--this nuance conversation about things outside of social media because that has dominated the conversation. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>STEPANOVICH: But the solution is--it's going to have to solve for that. </p><p>LEE: Right, as long as we go back to that. Okay, there was another question over here. That I see one more question, hand? That I see--okay. Final question and then we'll wrap up. </p><p>QUESTION: A lot of pressure. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I am Kristin Collins (PH). I'm a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center. I know this kind of ghost what you were just touching on. Morgan used the language of markets when you were discussing data and the idea of consumers knowing the value of their data in the market. And I wonder what the ethical and political advantages and disadvantages are of using that framework, especially when we think about the collective implications and the ways in which privacy is tied to things like disinformation or security and whether or not framing data in that will allow us to think more--in a more integrated manner of these different implications, so the idea of, you know, if we focus on the individual and their consent to their privacy in this exchange, will we be able to get at these bigger questions there tied into privacy, or will it limit our focus? </p><p>LEE: Interesting. Okay, why don't we go down the line? </p><p>STEPANOVICH: So I spoke about this last time I was on the stage. I actually think this is a really bad road to walk down. Once you start getting into how much is your data worth, you start getting into how much can we pay you for your data, and that's a super predatory business model, actually, where you start saying can we take advantage of certain marginalized communities in order to give the money for them to give up large amounts of their information. And then privacy becomes a privilege commodity reserved for those who can afford it. So I would prefer we stay away from that framing and--and start to think of it more as a series of rights the way the GDPR and CCPA both framed it. </p><p>LEE: You know if you want to say something different, it's okay. You agreed with Amie the whole time. It's okay to disagree. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BOONE: I'll jump in if you're stuck. </p><p>REED: Yeah, I want to think about it. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BOONE: I think Amie has a good point there and I think from the other side of it, from the innovation side of it, you have the potential then to restrict innovation to only those that can afford to pay for the data, and that is not good for anybody. That's not good for consumers and that's not good for all of the potential entrepreneurs and innovators out there. So I think I agree with Amie, it's a really risky path to walk down. </p><p>REED: I guess this is the hard part. I mean, it's a good question and it's--I may not have a crisp answer. Here's the thing, one of the most interesting--and having worked with Nicol on this, one of the most interesting aspects of smart phones has been the rapid adoption of this technology in--in communities that are--have been underserved by tech. </p><p>LEE: Right. </p><p>REED: Mobile--smart phone is the fastest adopted technology in the history of mankind by far. Faster than the wheel, faster than fire, faster than the microwave, which was close-- </p><p>STEPANOVICH: --Faster than fire? </p><p>REED: By far, yeah. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Like by every evidence about where you see, like, how quickly it moved around, I mean, you know, when you talk about marginal communities and impacted, you have folks in Bangladesh who did not have running water and do not have a street, or on dirt, and yet they use a smart phone to check commodities pricing before they go fishing so that they can make sure that they get the highest price by going to the next--to the right town. And while that's, you know, not in America, you see the same thing going on. </p><p>In the MississippiDelta, the University of Mississippi Medical Center is working to deal with type II diabetes in a community where they're more than two hours away from a healthcare professional because, guess what, that's a community that's poor and doesn't have a lot of education, but they've all got smart phones and they've all got data plans that allow them to have a lot of data access. So I'm--I want to be careful to not be quite as--as quick as Amie was on making this determination because I think that a lot of those communities actually see value. And I'll give you an example. </p><p>A lot of employers are now putting their--their job applications on mobile devices, especially ones that go to jobs that don't require college. And they're doing that because they find that people who will apply have a smart phone. They don't have a personal computer with a printer, but they do have a smart phone. And so before we jump to, oh, well those people can't possibly make good decisions, I--I want to be careful with that. And I understand your point about using the--the value framework, but I don't think that I, as a white guy, should tell people who aren't like me how they should make determinations. And I want to be very careful of not being too diminishing. </p><p>LEE: So I'll help you--I'll help you because I'm a black woman. </p><p>REED: That's right. That's why I'm like-- </p><p>LEE: --(INAUDIBLE) and I'm going to tell you why. I think--so Morgan, I think you're outnumbered on this one. </p><p>REED: That's fine. I'll lose. Like I said, I'm trying to be careful. </p><p>LEE: Let me--let me just--I'll share--but I'll give you a little bit of credit on something. So I think the question, and I'll wrap it up with this. I think the question is well-intentioned, right, because I think at the end of the day, the fundamental framework around any privacy conversations around the good stewardship on both the receiver and the recipient in this ecology, right, I want to know when I give my data it's done for good purpose, much like when we go to a bank and we give our money to the teller, we want to know that it's going into the vault and not into their pocket, right? </p><p>But when you talk about the valuation of data that what I, particularly among disparate groups or different types of people, you do run the risk of exploitation. And it already happens. I mean Henrietta Lacks, who some of you know about, gave up her information for a long time, helped to serve a lot of curable diseases and was never paid for it and died an indigent. And that's partly because we don't have in the society, it kind of goes back to what Amie said, the values that operate on the principle that all data is created equal and we don't have a system, which is why we're talking about privacy legislation that not only is all data created equal, but in some respects, all data carries a currency that is valuable to the person and not something that should be used and exploited and manipulated for other purposes. </p><p>And that's where I would leave it, Morgan. I think that even though people are on smart phones even though, for health reasons, they should be paid $0.10 for, you know, blood pressure prick in their arm doesn't mean that we want them walking around with 10,000 pricks in their arm just because somebody took advantage of them because they were going to be paid $0.50. Not having food is being hungry, and that's another issue that should not be solved by our ability to evaluate people's data. There's no currency in that. So with that, you can see why this is a difficult conversation to have, but one that we need to have, right? I want to thank the panelists. Let's give them a round of applause. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I hope that all of you take away from this that this is not the last privacy panel that you're going to go to, and I also hope that you take away from this that the issues, again, of the umbrella that we're dealing with have many spokes, and we will soon get there. Let's thank Amie for coming all the way from Boulder to visit us. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Thank you again, everyone. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-CJD1-JDPT-T014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Am I on, can you hear me okay? Great. My name is Ted Piccone. I'm a Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Program. I work on international order and strategy issues, among other things. </p><p>And a warm welcome to everyone here and to all of those who are watching us via our live webcast online for our sixth annual Justice Stephen Breyer Lecture on International Law. This series of transatlantic dialogue tackles cutting edge issues at the intersection of international law, security and increasingly, technology. </p><p>Over the last few years, we've used this occasion to examine such issues as cross-border data sharing for law enforcement and the role of international law in governing new tools of warfare, such as autonomous weapons. And all of that material is on our website. </p><p>We want to thank, first of all, the Municipality of the Hague, and The Embassy of the Netherlands for their steadfast support and partnership for this work and to Justice Breyer for his steady and thoughtful leadership on matters of international and comparative law. He is occupied with court business today. </p><p>For this year's lecture, we've chosen to examine an issue that really lacks an international normative standard or a multilateral process. And that is the protection of one's data and privacy online, an issue that directly affects anyone with an Email account, a Facebook profile or smart phone. </p><p>The timing for this discussion could not be better. The European Union is coming upon the one-year anniversary of its general data protection regulation, otherwise known as GDPR. This new rule requires any organization that holds or controls the personal data of E.U. residence to obtain clear customer consent and to build privacy by design as the default option for their organizations. And companies face large penalties for any serious breaches. And we'll hear a lot more about how GDPR implementation is going, this morning.  </p><p>On the U.S. side, we are hearing much greater public discussion and congressional debate over the adoption of privacy and data protection legislation. These include proposals to grant greater authority to the Federal Trade Commission, to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices which, of course, includes upholding their promises to protect our personal information. </p><p>As these debates, and we've seen a number of big data breaches in the past couple of years, as these continue, some states in the U.S. are not waiting for federal action. California, for example has adopted a consumer privacy act that gives residents the right to know what personal data is collected, how it is handled and to say \"no\" to its sale to others. </p><p>Of course, this is a big issue elsewhere outside of the United States. Other countries such as Brazil, Australia, India, Russia and China are considering their own protocols for data protection, many of which will not be so friendly to U.S. interest and our values and freedom of expression, the right to access information and protection of national security. </p><p>Meanwhile, technology doesn't sleep. Companies and researchers are racing ahead with the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Internet of things, for example, that is already opening new frontiers in the way our personal data is collected and marketed to others. </p><p>So, one of the key questions we hope to consider today, is how society should proactively govern the onslaught of these new digital technologies as they collect and process and repurpose our personal data and whether this can and should be done at the international level or be left to national authorities to sort out their own choices and, of course, we might end up with a very smorgasbord of options that start conflicting and clashing with one another. </p><p>To help us understand these complex and fast-moving developments, we've invited a top-notch panel of European and American experts from the world of ethics, law, international relations and sociology, for today's discussion. </p><p>Our keynote lecture will be given by Professor Jeroen Van Den Hoven from the Netherlands. Dr. Van Den Hoven is University Professor of Ethics and Technology at Delft University of Technology and Editor in Chief of the Journal Ethics and Information Technology. Among his many titles and awards, Professor Van Den Hoven was the program chair of the Dutch Research Program on Responsible Innovation and is currently a permanent member of the Ethics and New Technology Advisory Group for the President of the European Commission. </p><p>After his remarks, he will be joined for a panel discussion with three leading experts to share a comparative perspective on different U.S. and European approaches to data protection and privacy. </p><p>Cameron Kerry, a distinguished Fellow here at the Brookings Governance Program is the former General Counsel and Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. </p><p>Bilyana Petkova is a visiting Fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center here in Washington and Assistant Professor with the Department of International and European Law at Maastricht University of Law in the Netherlands. </p><p>And our moderator, Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, is a fellow in the Governance Studies Program here, Center for Technology Innovation, and a leading voice in promoting equal opportunity and civil rights in the digital technology and telecommunications industries.  </p><p>You have more information from their impressive bios in your handout. We encourage you to tweet your own thoughts, using the hashtag Breyer Lecture, and look forward to your questions to the panel later, in the program. </p><p>Before we hear from Jeroen, I would like to invite Saskia Bruines, the Deputy Mayor of The Hague to make some introductory remarks. After many years as Deputy Mayor for culture and information technology in Amsterdam, she now leads the city of Hague's work on education, the knowledge economy and international affairs.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>BRUINES: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It's great to be here. Thank you very well, thank you very much for well, for inviting me to be here. And it's my pleasure to welcome you also on the behalf of the city of The Hague. </p><p>You may be familiar with The Hague as a city of peace and justice. And I'm delighted to represent our city here today, and share our ideas on a vastly important subject. Let me use a short quote to explain why this is so important. It's a quote from 2017 and it is by a very famous state leader and he said, \"Artificial intelligence is the future for all mankind. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\" His name, Vladimir Putin, President of Russian Federation. </p><p>This world leadership to which Putin referred is, obviously, an extremely appealing prospect, not just for Russia, but equally for China, the United States, for example. And besides, this geopolitical game, we have to reckon with the enormous influence from companies like Huawei, Cisco, Facebook and many others. Companies that are able to launch brilliant invasions innovations on the markets but which, also, have daily access to privacy sensitive information. </p><p>Using this information companies can influence the lives of their customers and governments can influence the lives of their residents every day. And the question we face is whether the rights of all those customers and citizens are properly protected. </p><p>Isn't it time for fair global, ethical and legal rules regarding the use of data and AI? Rules that allow us to protect individual rights and freedom and that allow us to more effectively apply AI for the greater good. For example, in achieving the global sustainable development goals or in smart city programs, to provide better services to citizens in growing citizens like in Washington, D.C. and The Hague.  </p><p>Or applying data analysis to provide emergency aid more effectively and cheaply and thus, reach even more people in the wake of natural disasters. And by making the source of violent conflicts visible through the use of data thus promoting peace and justice, worldwide. </p><p>You might wonder why the city of The Hague is addressing such issues. This is because The Hague has embraced the development of international law for over a hundred years. Our peace palace is a wonderful icon in that respect. In a way, it is the very heart of our city. And of course, there are many, many more cities that contribute daily to creating a better world. </p><p>But we'd like to use our position as a city of peace and justice to stimulate the further developments of law. So that together, we can work towards creating equal rights and equal opportunities, also online. </p><p>In my own country, the national government will present a comprehensive strategy for the use of data and AI later this year. And the European Union is also focusing on this, also thanks to the efforts of committed tough leaders like Jeroen Van Den Hoven. </p><p>And the wake of these developments the Netherlands aims to become the European hotspot for AI development in Europe. As a result, more and more parties are being attracted to our city. For example, for many years we have been home to NATO's communications and information agency. </p><p>The U.N. Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute made a conscious choice to base its Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, called CAIR, in The Hague. </p><p>And I'm happy to announce that here, that the umbrella organization of over 7,000 European AI researchers called CLAIRE, will soon be basing its head office in our city. </p><p>As a city of peace and justice, we see a role for ourselves as an honest broker. A city where many people work together to develop the law and encourage the peaceful responsible use of data, AI and robotics. </p><p>In our city, The Hague, more than 2,000 institutes, universities, think-tanks, NGOs and companies work together for market leader to startups and to take a science initiative, for example, we combine tough issues facing organizations with the smart knowledge of startups and which always produce applicable answers. </p><p>The Hague, therefore, welcomes you and everyone who is working on this topic with open arms to join us in further developing the law and working to what's fair, just and peaceful societies.  </p><p>Thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: Good morning. It's a great pleasure to be here and to be able to address you with some introductory remarks on global governance and ethics of artificial intelligence and it's great to be part of that wonderful operation in The Hague. And I shall come back and forth between The Hague and Delft in the middle and then, to Brussels and I'm the permanent member of this committee advises the European commission on innovation and new technologies. </p><p>And we've produced this report. But I will be speaking as a private person, as an academic not as a member of that group, today. So, I will need some 25 minutes and I hope that the chairman grants me those 25 minutes. </p><p>I think we're all on the same page whether it's from the corporate world or from the public world. So, the commission has said the stakes couldn't be higher. The way we approach AI will define the world we live in. And I think that's a very important theme to bear in mind that we are going to use this technology to express our ideals, and to express our values and that will come back to shape us again. I will come back to that topic. </p><p>But you know when something really special is happening when Henry Kissinger is actually thinking about these things and even from an ethical and philosophical perspective, he said, \"Philosophically-intellectually in every way, human society is unprepared for the rise of artificial intelligence,\" in a paper called How the Enlightenment Ends. </p><p>Well, how does AI accomplish all of that? First, we started out in the '50s and then, '70s, to think that the expertise of thinking and understanding and cognition was in rules. So, we started to make explicit and write down all the rules of all the medical experts and the chemical experts. You see an example there, and this is an example from health care, from medicine., Only to find out it's not located in hundred, not even in thousand rules. It's somewhere else. new it's an evanescent quality and, if we talk about AI now, we talk about these kind of architectures, completely different architectures, not rule based, not following logic. It's subsymbolic. It's not put in concepts, neat concepts and in logical rules but it's in something like our brain, right. </p><p>And it learns like our brain. It adjusts itself on the basis of inputs to produce particular outputs and we can train it up as we train up a baby. </p><p>The interesting thing to note is, here, these things are very complex and they are even so complex, and I'll come back to that because it has ethical consequences, so complex that the people who craft them and make them don't understand them, actually. </p><p>So, this is all wonderful. You can do great things with it. You know, it can help you to distinguish your dog from a muffin.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, that's wonderful, it can also help you to become a GO: World Champion. That's a formidable very impressive experience and Google DeepMind has done that. </p><p>So, what is at stake with this extremely powerful technology that gobbles up and uses all the data to learn about patterns, structures, to optimize to make processes more efficient. It can do that with satellite images, with nautical images. It can do it in industry context. It can do it in hospital context. It can do it, look for vulnerabilities in cyber security systems, etc. </p><p>So, it's a quite generic technology. What's at stake? Well, as the Deputy Mayor already pointed out, some people have started to appreciate this and not always in ways that we appreciate it. But I mean, I'll leave that to you or to the panel discussion. </p><p>This is what's happening and we know that there is a battle going on between China, Russia and the United States and I will come back to others, as well. And we know what China is doing. It's applying all of this stuff to better face recognition, to more efficient and effective surveillance technologies. It's using citizen scores to keep tabs on their populations and is also doing the same thing in the new digital scramble for Africa. It's rolling out software there and it's also sucking up a lot of data there. </p><p>We know what the Americans have been doing, what you and we have all been doing and we have and Europe have been benefiting from, also, to a certain extent. And there is not only a big tech development, there's also a little bit of a tech, a big tech lash, you know, so were now starting to criticize and question all the data that we have freely given to those big companies to serve us for all kinds of wonderful conveniences that were very happy to buy but now, you know, we have some second thoughts about that. And we'll come back to it. </p><p>So, the big question is, where is Europe going in all of this? It's clear what the Chinese picture is. It's clear what the U.S. picture is. It's clear what the Russia picture is. I don't know how to qualify that more but, in any case, the question is what is Europe doing? Is Europe to be the Museum of the world at some time, as suggested, or is it perhaps the cradle of new enlightenment and enlightenment 2.0? </p><p>It's interesting to look at what was said in a press release of this European plan is the biggest plan, also an investment plan. For the E.U., it's not so much a question of winning or losing a race between the U.S.A and China but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human centered, ethical, secure and true to our core values. </p><p>So, it seems that there is a third way, you know, this is not Chinese way this is U.S. American way which is driven by Silicon Valley but also by the Pentagon so it's working on two cylinders, right. </p><p>And there could be a third way. And Macron has already experimented with this two years ago when he released his big plan with a couple of billion of euros, real money. He's putting his money where his mouth is. It was spearheaded by a top mathematician Fields winner, Cedric Villani, and he referred to it as AI for humanity. </p><p>So, the third way could be AI for humanity. But it's interesting to bear in mind that images of man and models of society get expressed in your AI technology and again, once that has been done, it will come back and shape us, again. </p><p>And we know that pattern. And this is a very interesting book. It's about Oriental Despotism a Comparative Study of Total Power, Karl Wittfogel, '57, 1957. And he shows how civil engineering and water management were the basis of the power of many of the ancient oriental empires and it dictated and suggested how their society should be run, namely top-down, centralistic. Otherwise, you could never do this. You would have large-scale forced labor, etc. </p><p>So, that's a very interesting way. It's now, not longer about hydraulic empires, it's about digital empire building. </p><p>You could do it in very simple ways. You know, this is more efficient. If you don't want people to sleep on those benches in the park, it's more efficient to do it this way than to have hundred people running around and chasing people away. But there is also the more, you know, digital version of this. </p><p>And this is algorithms. Algorithms shape our behavior as the steel rods on the benches in the parks do. It's very true, and I've already said it in a couple of ways, we shape our buildings and, thereafter, our buildings shape us. We shape our digital societies and then our digital societies start to shape us. </p><p>So, in the case of China, what gets expressed? It's called socialism with Chinese characteristics. It's autocracy and party rule. It's ubiquitous surveillance, filtering and firewalls instead of investing in deliberative tools, of deliberative democracy, privacy enhancing technology. It's working with citizen scores. It's working with the idea of social harmony instead of the human rights discourse. </p><p>And already in the Human Rights Council, there are attempts to replace those terms of human rights by the idea, conveniently vague as it is, of social harmony. </p><p>So, the model of man that is lying underneath that is a kind of a strange mixture of behaviorism, you know, sticks and carrots and keeping tabs on what people do by means of big data and machine learning and actually punishing and rewarding people, in order to make them behave in the right way. So that's AI for control. </p><p>In the USA, it's Silicon Valley in the driver seat, innovative in the grey zone, move fast, break things first, apologize later. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Regulatory aloofness when it comes to the governance of technology, Chicago school economics, austere individualism, libertarian values, and the model of man is Homo Economicus  AI for profit. </p><p>And then, we have Europe which takes its start from the European charter of fundamental rights and the European convention of human rights, open liberal democracies and rule of law, multilateralism and the focus on international legal order and global justice., Opportunities for AI to reach the U.N. sustainable development goals, Rhineland model of corporate governance, strong regulation by competition law and data protection, the model of man being a Kantian enlightenment conception of the moral of the person and Homo Socialis. AI for humanity. We still have a couple of seats in Europe available so, if you interested, you can join us. </p><p>But a recent document in the E.U., External Action Service, referred to China as a systemic rival whose engagement with the world of norms, rules and multilateral organizations is selective, at best. But bear in mind that we're all systemic rivals in this sense. We are using comprehensive ideas of what the good life is for our citizens, what is--what is the best way to arrange our societies and expressing it in digital technology. And AI is functioning as this huge systems integrator. It's making a lot of those ambitions possible. </p><p>Think of, in the case of China, the global financial system and think of the renminbi as the reserve currency or the new silk route or the military buildup or the science and technology programs or the industrial program, made in China 2025. </p><p>And then this final piece, replacing human rights discourse by the idea of social harmony. You could get nowhere with these large ambitions if you wouldn't have top notch digital technology with AI. You could simply not do that. </p><p>So, it looks as if we're moving to a multipolar interregnum, where we have competing conceptions of what the good life is, what a society should look like and what man is and work from that. So, what is that, what are the building blocks for this third way, from this European perspective? I am going to share some--some thoughts that I have, also as a result of being a lot in Brussels and talking to people of the commission. Again, I'm not representing the commission but I'm just sharing those thoughts with you. </p><p>The first building block is this ethics by design that is becoming more and more important. No longer getting a book from the shelf in your library and read Kant and Aristotle and John Stuart Mill. It is looking at the technology and expressing your ideas and your values in it. </p><p>The top legal advisor of the European Commission said, in order to protect and strengthen Western liberal democracies in the age of AI, and the core Trinitarian idea of human rights, rule of law and democracy, we need and I quote \"a new culture of technology and business development which we call human rights, rule of law and democracy by design.\" </p><p>He is the single handedly responsible or, at least, has had a major influence in the drafting of the GDPR. </p><p>Same for Buttarelli, who is the European Data Protection Supervisor, recently organized the mother of all privacy conferences and European Parliament in Brussels. Again, putting centerstage digital ethics by design.  </p><p>So, we will have to deal with a lot of this, right, a lot of technologies on the left-hand side, a lot of values on the right-hand side and we have to bring those together. We would have to be able to think, in quite some detail, about deep learning and human dignity, about a block chain and sustainability. </p><p>So, we have to bring together those worlds of the social sciences, the humanities and engineering. These are the examples. </p><p>So, this is the key problem of what we call value sensitive design on the left-hand side, we have all of those values that we think are very important and on the right-hand side, we have the world of engineering and technology and we want to express our ideas in those technologies and be able to explain what that was a good idea and that we did a good job. </p><p>So, Macron also said this in his famous Wired Magazine, \"If you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries.\" </p><p>So, that's a bridge to the second building block of that European third way and that's responsible innovation. This is the principle and the leading idea and the European Commission has invested 500 million under its last R&amp;D program, Horizon 2020, and it's going to invest a lot of money again in the new program, Horizon Europe, which will be hundred billion euros. </p><p>If you can change the world by innovation today so that you can satisfy more of your obligations tomorrow, you have a moral obligation to innovate today. So, we are looking at all of those values, all of those things that we need to do for future generations, for our children, for our neighbors, for people who are hungry and poor. </p><p>And--but we are overburdened. There's so much to do, so innovation is the idea of, perhaps we could cheat, could tweak the world in such a way that we could do more of the things that we need to do. </p><p>So, innovation becomes a moral concept and not just about the iPhone 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, marginal increases in functionality. </p><p>Smart fusion of conflicting values in design. And the best example is privacy by design. Privacy by design is the simple idea that, if you want to count the number of people here, right, and you don't want to disclose their identities, you could do this. </p><p>And this is what is called, technically, coarse graining the data. And it's a simple idea in which you could have your way, you use the functionality technology without the violations of privacy. That is the pattern. That is the idea of responsible innovation. Think along those lines. </p><p>And it has given rise to a whole industry in innovation, ecosystems that do this thing exactly this thing, because they will not give up on privacy but they will also not want to give up on the incredible benefits that the technology can offer. </p><p>With respect to AI, for example, we can do machine learning on homomorphic encrypted data, right. So, we can use big data and use machine learning and, at the same time, respect privacy. </p><p>Now, the third building block in Europe is that we never shy away from up front going back and tapping into our fundamental principles, fundamental rights and human rights. So, our foundations are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention of Human Rights. </p><p>In the paper that I referred to, the statement on artificial intelligence, we go through a number of problems. And so, we identify them in the papers online. So, safety and risk, safety, risk and security, precaution is a famous European principle, be very careful before you put things out there. Moral responsibility, I will come back to that privacy. Democratic decision-making, the optimization of social complex processes by means of scores, citizen scores or credit scores and the lack are the work that needs to be done on institutional and mechanism design to help ourselves to a safe environment for these new technologies. </p><p>And we identify a number of principles that are, can be found in these European charters in the convention for human rights. I don't have time to go into them but important is to that, this statement was published a year ago and now, the high-level expert group has been tasked with detailing these principles. And it's actually doing this. It has accomplished this and it will be presented next week in Brussels, a full-fledged report on the ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI. </p><p>And so, I was in, I served as an independent observer on behalf of the commission in this work of the high-level group, expert group. And so, they think of trustworthy AI as having three dimensions. First of all, it needs to be in compliance with the extant U.E. law. </p><p>Secondly, it needs to be ethically sound and it needs to be, and that means it adheres to a number of principles that overlap with the principles of the EGE report and it needs to be technically robust. It needs to deliver on the things it's promised and it needs to be, you know, in line with the requirements and specs. </p><p>The fourth building block is this that we identify the ethical problems and, I think, there is a, there's a way to lump them together to classify them because there seems to be a little bit of a preoccupation in Europe with the ethical problems that are tied to a particular conception of the person. So, they're very, so it's not only about damage or harm to people or risks, safety and security risk, but it's something to do with the person. </p><p>And you can see that, if we go through a number of the problems that are related to artificial intelligence that, at the same time, chip away at the conditions of being a responsible, autonomous agent, right. So, what are the conditions for being a full-fledged autonomous, responsible agent? Knowledge, you have to know what you're doing. You have to be in control of what you're doing. You have to have a choice, right. And you have to think of yourself as an integral person. </p><p>So, those four conditions are all threatened by artificial intelligence and official intelligence and big data. So, that is, and this is the reason why we, the two worlds come together. </p><p>First of all, knowledge, transparency and explain ability, I've already referred to this. So, we have a problem keeping track of what's happening inside of those neural nets. They are very powerful, they produce wonderful results that we can benefit from but at the same time we do not understand their black boxes. </p><p>So, we have made the world a very complex place even before the event of AI. But now, they've become, as explained, a little bit more obscure and, I think this is a very good contribution, both books are wonderful to read, The Black Box Society, Frank Pasquale, and Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O'Neil. </p><p>And there is a very good example, I like it a lot, and I will explain it. We bring out the problem immediately. So, you train up an AI system or a neural net to make the distinction between wolves and Huskies, right. So, you give it a lot of examples of not muffins and dogs in this case, but Huskies and wolves. It turned out, and it's doing its job greatly, wonderful. But it turned out that it was looking just for snow in the background. </p><p>So, all the wolves were photographed in the snow and the Huskies were photographed against the green background in the garden and so, it hadn't learned anything about the difference between Huskies and wolves. It's just looking for snow in the background. </p><p>So, this can happen and you can find out by accident that this has happened. But if you start to apply this in a human context, HR context, or a criminal justice context, that is a problem. </p><p>This is also an interesting problem. You know, the system has 57 percent confidence that that is a panda bear. And then you add some random noise to the photograph which is undetectable to the human eye. And then, suddenly, the system has 99 percent confidence that it's a given. And we don't know how it gets to that answer. So, that is, of course, then you are open to a lot of spoof and visceral attacks because you could fool, you know, defense systems, easily, by just throwing in a little bit of random noise that is undetectable. </p><p>So, data, black box and results. And if you apply this, as is done also here in the United States, this to a criminal justice context where a judge is using such a system to decide about parole, then you have a problem because it's under motivated and with success that could be viewed. </p><p>So, the holy grail is explainable AI. Again, responsible innovation of AI which would suggest that you would try to get all the benefits of this powerful technology but without the drawbacks. So, make it transparent, as transparent as we can. </p><p>And the first legislation that we have is already in the GDPR was referred to and it states that persons may not be subjected solely to automated decision procedures with far-reaching results and if it's used, meaningful information about the logic of the process needs to be provided alright. </p><p>So, that is a little bit of a problem. And there's a lot of technical work being done now. This is just an example of producing heat maps where you can just see a little bit where this neural network has been going for and what has it been looking at in the pictures. So, it's producing those kind of heat maps. So, a lot of technical work is being done. </p><p>All to prevent this, what Joe Weizenbaum already wrote in the '70s. He said, modern technological rationalizations in war, politics, commerce have an even more insidious effect, decision-makers have abdicated their decision-making responsibility to a technology they do not understand long before deep learning, responsibility altogether has evaporated. They cannot help but base their judgment on what the computer says. So, that's something that we would like to prevent. </p><p>The second is control, a condition for responsibility. I didn't have control over the cup because my hands were slippery, right. So, if you don't have control, you cannot be held responsible. You cannot take responsibility and people cannot make you responsible. </p><p>So, but we know that the application of AI produces a lot of control issues, right. In self-driving cars and in lethal autonomous weapons system which use the same software as Amazon, recommender system. If you go to the website, you've read this book. You may also be interested in that book. If these machines use that logic, that same software, you get things like okay, you like this target, you may also like that target, especially recommended for you, right.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>It could happen. It's the same logic. It's the same software. And we know, it's very tragic that there is this man machine fight to regain control over systems that are completely gone haywire. Or not haywire. I mean, it's a logic that they just consistently impose upon the human context. </p><p>So, we need to think about meaningful human control, meaningful human control. We've written some things about it. But as a discussion, there's also in Geneva on lethal autonomous weapons systems is going on. Then, freedom and choice. If you are forced, if you have no options, if you couldn't think otherwise, then your actions and your responsibility is compromised, of course Sorry, I had a gun to my head, I--I--I, there's was nothing for me to--I couldn't think differently. </p><p>And that's, of course, happening with these recommender systems with the digital environment online that suggests all kinds of things on the basis of our past performance online and our history. So, it's histories, you know, looks us up in filter bubbles and echo chambers and we don't get exposed to different opinions, anymore, so we don't have a chance to listen to critique. That is a problem, we will all be reading the daily me. </p><p>And this is Cass Sunstein, the nudging pope, former advisor to Obama. And so, he said, so we're using those big data machine learning to get a better grip on people and to understand how we could change their behavior. And it's becoming very, very, effective. Right. And he even said in his book, \"Why nudge? It is possible that companies that provide clear simple products would do poorly in the marketplace, because they are not taking advantage of people's propensity to blunder.\" </p><p>And so, there are some things to be exploited there and we are studying this by, you know, collecting the big data of what people do online and using machine learning to get a better understanding of it and then, change their behavior or affect their behavior. And we know it's been used in politics and we know not to what extent. We're still looking into this. </p><p>But micro-targeting is a real problem. And it's done on the basis of AI and it's done on the basis big data. So, we have, what I have called, a Bermuda triangle of advanced behavioral science and nudging big data and artificial intelligence that are reinforcing, mutually reinforcing each other. And those people who have access, and can afford to buy access, to that triangle or a triad, have a lot of power to wield. </p><p>So, we need to design for democracy. Democracy will not just happen because there are forces there outside that we have set ourselves created that work against democracy. So, we need to do that. </p><p>Privacy and data protection, finally. It's surprising to see that people are working in data protection often find it very difficult to be very clear and precise about why privacy is so important, right. So, they often say well, it's scary, you know, people know all this stuff. </p><p>But there are some very, very good reasons to do data protection in order to prevent harm to people, exploitation, discrimination, manipulation, stigmatization, limitation of choice and freedom, limitation of their autonomy, failure to respect them as human beings and their dignity. </p><p>And therefore, the data protection GDPR has these principles there. This is the reason why we have that. Whether it's the right way to protect it, we can discuss in the panel, right. I think what is coming is a paradigm shift. I think we will do it in completely different way without giving up on the importance of protecting individuals. </p><p>It's interesting to see that the latest economists and the praise of the European approach, you know, ruling by ethics, the determinators. And it's how, it's a kind of two-pronged approach by competition law because Vistagar (PH) is now onto this big time because the access to the data and to the technology into the platforms gives, you know, the big tech such an incredible power that the only way to take that back is to bring in antitrust and, at the same time, insist on giving control back to people with respect to their data. </p><p>And there are a number of initiatives that are very, very interesting that go in this direction. Tim Berners Lee, you know, the father of the worldwide web is busy with re-decentralizing the web because it started as a decentral infrastructure and gradually it became, you know, the place where people grabbed the power and it centralizes the power. So, he's going to re-decentralize the web by giving control back to people over their data. </p><p>Self-sovereign identify with distributed ledger experiments. Also, the Dutch government and member states of the E.U. are experimenting with these block changes distributed ledger's in order to give control back, to give everyone a digital blocker that you control, right. And now, the companies have to come to you and ask for your data. And you enter into a contract. So, and also Estonia and some other initiatives are there that are experimenting with this. </p><p>As I said, I think the new head of Federal Trade Commission has also, some sympathy.  I've seen some sympathetic remarks about the European third way. </p><p>Some last remarks. Three more. The future of global governance and ethics in this space of AI. First of all, we need to realize, whatever we do in this space of global governance and ethics of AI, big data privacy, etc., we have to realize it is a deeply human affair. This is about Dr. Frankenstein. It's not about the monster, right. </p><p>It's about us. We create this, we design it, we sell it to people who use it to fool other people or to do good things for other people. That is what needs to be assessed. That is what needs to be evaluated. </p><p>And there are some scary applications, right. We now can, and this is remarkable, we can predict the death of people who are admitted to hospital and who are wired to a lot of measuring devices. So, FDA approved crisis predicting algorithm to save hospital patients from early death. </p><p>But it's also used in the context of terminal care where we can say, well, we need to cut 40 percent of the cost. Well, let's not spend more time on these people if we go by what the algorithm says. And a very important development. This is the MIT moral machine, you can play this game the trolley dilemma. So, should the self-driving car hit those, you know, this group or that group? Should it run over the old lady or should it hit the boy with the dog, or whatever, you know. So, endless variations. </p><p>But millions of people have played this and it's in the database of, this time it's MIT Now, if we are thinking about doing the software for self-driving cars, then we should probably attempt it to look into the database of MIT and say, well, what did a million people think should be done? Let's program the car along these lines. </p><p>What we're doing now is we are, you know, implementing the ethics of what a million people said. But we have some very nasty examples from history where a million people were absolutely wrong. So, this is changing the enormity of direction of fit and it's a classical fallacy where you declare this to be ought, right, is to imply ought. And that cannot be done. It doesn't imply that these are not data points, that what 1 million people think about these things should not be part of your considerations in your analysis, but it should not be the final word on this. </p><p>So, ethics by design, and is related to this, you know, it's the poor guy at the switch, he has to make this choice, but we have to--you know, should the train, you know, run over one person or over five persons. Should you shift it to hit that one person? If you don't do anything, it will hit those five people. </p><p>We know it, you know it, it's in the popular press. And--but what's never--never observed is that this guy has a moral problem because of the design of the infrastructure. If the lever would be, at the same time, designed to be a brake, he would have a problem. But it wasn't designed as a brake. </p><p>So, the engineering students in Delft tell you, this is by design. The philosophers don't buy this by the way, of course. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>The other thing is so think design, right. So, it's about people, it's not about--and be careful of agency laundering, a beautiful term a colleague Ellen Ruble has--as introduced, agency laundering, where you look at a technical system as, oh, where are the humans. Look for the humans because they have decided things, they have overlooked things, they have neglected their duties, etc. </p><p>That's where you need to think design. And the other thing is think systems, you know. If we think about nuclear safety, our first reaction is to look for the--the concrete walls. How thick the concrete walls? How--what's the temperature of the cooling water? </p><p>That's not what it's about. So, now we jump to algorithms because that's a sexy term, we look at the algorithm. The algorithms sit in IT infrastructure in a data--data ecosystem. That's what you need to look at. It's much about the training of the security guards, the safety of the nuclear power insulation than it's about the inner workings of it. </p><p>Also, you have to differentiate AI and big data where it's working in different cases. Safety for these types of ships is different from how you use it and where it's used, under which conditions. You cannot take that boat on the left upper corner to from Rosa Dam to New York, you can do that with that thing. You are not in short, you're criminally liable if you do that. </p><p>So, AI can be used under certain conditions with certain specifications in the operating theater room. So, institutional mechanisms, also very important. We--we only think that food is safe because we rely on an elaborate system of institutions. And we'd like that in case of AI. So, we need to help ourselves to those institutional. </p><p>Finally, we live in a very hyper connected and interdependent world. Our fates, humanities fate is very connected, where something goes wrong here, it has consequences over there. And we need to appreciate that. That's what we appreciate in--in the Hague and, therefore, it's a great pleasure to do all of this research and this work in the Hague. And so, I'm looking forward to the discussion. Not--not 25 minutes probably. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>TURNER LEE: As everyone is getting miced, all I can say is, wow. What a presentation. Want to again, welcome everybody to Brookings as we jump into a panel discussion, in reaction, I think to what we heard and the presentation. As it was mentioned, I'm Doctor Nicol Turner Lee, I'm a fellow in the Center for Technology and Innovation here, and someone who has actually visited this great city of the Hague. And very happy to have everybody here with us in the states. So, thank you for being here. </p><p>I just want to unpack everything that you said. But I can't do that in this period of time because I got company. And so, what I would like to do is to start Cam with you to sort of react to what you've heard in the lecture. And as we react to that, thinking about, I think, the heart of this discussion, which is how do we balance U.S. and E.U. interest? Or will there be points of diversions, right, as it was indicated in the presentation? So, why don't you give us some short reaction. </p><p>KERRY: Okay. Well, thanks. And thank you for that--that very impressive and wide-ranging, thoughtful presentation. I guess that--to respond, Nicol, I think I'm, what, less pessimistic about AI than I think some of the precautionary, principal posits were then, let's say, Henry Kissinger is in his reflections on it. </p><p>I think--I think some of what Jeroen as outlined about the limitations of AI demonstrate that there are so many respects in which human beings are more capable than--than machines. And that, you know, whatever the predictions are about the abilities of AI, they are far much further off than, you know, many of those--those predictions, dyer or optimistic, often posit. </p><p>That said, I think, you know, I think that leads into some of the differences in--in approach. I think, you know, there, I think are fewer differences, frankly, then--than I think you--you suggest. You know, and I think a lot of the differences that we see, with respect to AI or to GDPR, come to--from differences in our approach to our legal and regulatory systems. </p><p>And, you know, I believe that--that several of the arguments about this really are results of cognitive dissonance that come from differences between, you know, a civil law system and a common law system, and thinking that results from that. </p><p>So, we look at E.U. approach in general GDPR, some of what Jeroen as described for AI, it is comprehensive. It flows down from central organizing principles. It's a Cartesian, logically ordered universe versus common law is a much more ad hoc, much more iterative approach. And that is also how--how technology works. </p><p>So, you know, that's some of the analogies in our system and Silicon Valley. If I were using slides, I'd put up a slide of that on one slide the Gardens of Versailles. You know, this beautiful geometrically ordered landscape versus the Gardens of Frederick Law Olmsted, there where I live in Boston, organic no obvious order. And that's the common law. </p><p>I'm--and we see this GDPR, it's one law comprehensive. We have 56 different federal privacy laws and state laws, and a little bit the same playing out and AI. So, Europeans, they look at that and they think it's the wild West. I've certainly heard Europeans say, Americans have no--and I've seen it in print. Americans have no laws on privacy. </p><p>But, you know, we do have lots of laws. And I think Americans, you know, tend to look at GDPR, what's this have to lawful grounds for processing. But I got to say, mother may I. And this is interfering with my permission list innovation. And I think we see sort of things in AI and the commission process that Jeroen has--has described. </p><p>But I'm--you know, I have heard a Europeans say, you know, we must have rules to--to define this area. And I think, in contrast, you know, we've recently had a presidential executive order, I think, frames a lot of the same issues. We want U.S. leadership. We want an investment. We want training for workforces. </p><p>But then that sort of says, you know, each federal agency you go off and you figure out how to deal with AI in your sectors. Some of that, I think, is appropriate, issues for streetcars or autonomous vehicles are different than AI in medicine, different from AI for autonomous weapon systems. </p><p>So, we need some of this. I think, though, frankly, some of having an executive order is also that it could be implemented with the only engagement from a president who seems to have an aversion to anything associated with the word intelligence is to put a signature on it. </p><p>I mean, I think this does contrast with, you know, some of the engagements the Obama Administration did a White House report on artificial intelligence. And, you know, we are, I think seeding leadership and lots of areas of digital policy to Europe. I think it is striking that Europe has a vice president and a commissioner, you know, for the digital economy. </p><p>You know, we have--we are not thinking systematically enough on this. But I think we have issues in common, tech lash is trans-Atlantic. So, I am hopeful, and maybe we can explore this further, that there are opportunities to work together. I think, you know, we have different systems, we're going to work in different ways, but I think, common--common values. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah. So, Bilyana, actually go to you is what Cam's remarks and what we've heard from Jeroen's remarks is really this conversation around framing, right. And what I think Cam has sort of injected is this conversation around jurisdiction and authority. And there seems to be, I think, some differences in approach state versus federal. So, why don't you remark on that, and then again, we'll dig into some questions and sort of unpack what we've heard today. </p><p>PETKOVA: Great. Well, thanks very much to the organization for having me. It's great to be here among so many distinguished speakers. And what I want to do today is just use up my short intro to say a little bit about regulatory theory and federalism comparing the E.U. with the U.S. context. </p><p>So, both the Federalist and the regulatory angle, I believe, our relevant to our discussion on digital technology the age of AI. And this dove tails with debate about framing the issues tech lash or as responsible innovation. I just finished teaching a small course in the U.S. here in Georgetown on the general data protection regulation, and I was happy to see that actually the majority of my students were Americans, they weren't Europeans who were doing their LM at Georgetown. </p><p>So, I think go back to Cam's point, there is hope. So, let me start with federalism. First of all, what do we understand by federalism? This is not the term explicitly enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. How vague it is the concept that has had a tremendous doctrinal impact. </p><p>As such federalism remains a disputed the notion while that was associated with centralization when the U.S. Federation was too young. More recently, federalism comes to be understood in the U.S. as preserving or even in housing local autonomy. </p><p>Conversely in the context of the European Union, federalism tends to be used anonymously with directing more power to the U.S.--sorry, to the E.U. institutions. And now, of course, with looming Brexit, the vote is happening as we speak. It is not a term of art preferred on the other side of the point. </p><p>Despite the fact that the E.U. system functions with its own charter fundamental rights, supremacy direct effect for E.U. law as cause federation in nobody name. There is one approach to federalism, however, that breaches these two divergent interpretations. This is the understanding that the U.S. Justice Brandeis has adopted on the states as laboratories of democracy. </p><p>And current Yale Law School Dean, Heather Gerken impacts this approach in her take on federalism as a process of continuous local and state experimentalism. And to some ideas, crystallize, and have to get adopted as federal benchmarks. </p><p>So, and to date the privacy field, we see how these dynamics has played out role in the E.U. where the first date of privacy statute was adopted in the German locality of Hessen to be taken up on the level of the German Federation in the 1970s, and later followed by French and Swedish, the protection laws to serve as a canvas for the first global comprehensive data privacy statute to be adopted 1990s, the European data  protection directive. </p><p>So, the rationale for Europeanizing the high level of data protection espoused at the time by these states was the few, the rest of E.U. members including new comers will lower the bar and thus place it a comparative disadvantage German French businesses, whatever. </p><p>So, in my academic writings a couple of years back, I argued that even its tradition and privacy regulation to a number of soft law initiatives and Centura privacy protective legislation, California is well-placed to play a similarly leading role in the U.S. </p><p>Today the California Consumer Privacy Act is a reality and the new law will enter into force in 2020. So, it seems fair to say that any attempt for a comprehensive federal consumer privacy statute in the U.S. will take the CCPA as a starting point, something that Kennedy transpired from the testimonies of Allister Mac Tucker (PH) the main force behind the CCPA in various committees before Congress. </p><p>States, and I want to add, localities is recently we see in the U.S., not only the state attorney generals, but also the city attorney generals entering the fray of privacy enforcement. So, they matter as conduits for national or E.U. policies. </p><p>State, and now the local level, is important first and foremost, from a democratic point of view, but it is also important from the point of view at experimentalism and--and ideas generation. So, global cities like New York, Amsterdam and, indeed, Washington DC become sort of test bets for tech companies. </p><p>When trying to understand the effects of new business models fueled by data, and the effects of regulation that is trying to harness technology or associative benefits, our cities become the next frontier. Alright, so, let's pause here. Federalism, the role of localities and states on the national level, and very briefly, I want to make a second point about regulatory theory. </p><p>Ever since political scientist, David Vogel, coined the term California effect in the 1990s, many have asked themselves, including Vogel, to what extent policy convergent stored a more astringent regulatory standard is really possible on a global scale. </p><p>Vogel's theory of have a race to the top the California effect based on California's first mover high environmental standards for car manufacturers, is based on the premise that trade liberalization triggers stricter standards developing jurisdiction--jurisdictions with a large market share to force private companies in other jurisdictions with weaker standards, either to meet the current standard or sacrifice a large portion of their exports. </p><p>Of course, California is one such large market for tech companies, but the E.U., another. So, fast-forward to 2015 when a Columbia law professor, Anu Bradford, introduced another buzzword for academics the, Brussels effect. </p><p>In the field of data privacy, it became attractive to think of the newly enacted GDPR enforcing's made 2018 as becoming a defect to gold standard for most companies, in an example of the Brussels effect. Vogel's theory that rules move to a higher level is based primarily on the assumption that export oriented firms do not want to have different rules in their home market, since complying with different rules can drive up cost, visibly domestic competitors. </p><p>The assumption is also that companies want to work with one gold standard for convenience, whereas, that might prove true in many areas, it cannot necessarily be true in others. So, think about the implementation on a global scale of the right to be forgotten. So, Google has pushed back against that quite a lot. </p><p>There is, however, an important case pending before the Court of Justice. So, as technology gives the possibility to lower the cost of diversifying products and services offered in different markets, again, think of the event of geo-blocking the wholesale application of Vogel's theory becomes somewhat disputed. So, I think by large, I'm out of time. So, I'll stop here and will go to the (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah, I know, this is actually interesting. So, I want to bring everyone into this conversation, right. So, what we've heard from Bilyana is this whole conversation around this conflict between, you know, what the U.S. is trying to do in terms of federal legislation right now, if I go back to the presentation, it's probably rooted in this need for marketplace certainty, right. </p><p>So, a lot of U.S. privacy concerns are really based on whether, you know, companies have certainty in terms of innovation. And if you counter that against what we're seeing in the GDPR, which tends to look at some more normative frameworks around that. </p><p>It's apparent that there may be this sort of disparate implementation of rules internationally. So, I want to start their first because if there is the somewhat disparate implementation of rules around privacy, let's start there before we go into AI, are we Balkanizing the Internet in many respects? And so that's part A.  </p><p>And then, Cam, I want to come back to you in terms of what that effect that has in the U.S., right, when we begin to look at, I think that was sort of indicate the remarks a national framework versus state of California, which is actually putting in their own rules to be adapted January 1st of next year.  </p><p>So, let's just start there. I mean, are we seeing in these conversations, these layers of privacy that are really going to lead to disparate rules, disparate impacts, potentially more manipulation and controls on freedom of expression, you know, just because of the nature of the ecology in which we're creating? I'll start with you, Jeroen. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: Yeah. I think we're already seeing a little bit of that. And, but the first question that you're-- I mean, although we have also kind of some serious concerns about our internal market-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: --Right. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: -- and the same time affects, we want to have level playing field and we want to have the same rules for all the member states so that we have certainty for, you know, so, that's also a concern that we recognize. It's not alien to us, right. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Right, right. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: The other thing that I think Brussels is always asking, you know, what should be apart from the whole trade argument is, what do we want to achieve together? You know, there's always the bigger picture. It's always like, you know, is there a kind of a real trans-Atlantic deeper kind of thing going on if we want to. And then we are willing to for solutions as we've done in all this decades of passenger list, you know, at the early stages of, you know, so people coming to Europe and talking about which databases could be used by which kind of, you know. </p><p>So, I think that the coming back to the geopolitics of it is what I see how is that there are new arguments to look for a deeper kind of trans-Atlantic relationship on the basis of which we can become a little bit more pragmatic-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: --Yes, yes. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: -- about, you know, the nitty-gritty details of how we deal with these things because we--it turns out we have, perhaps, more in common than we have these agreements, although these agreements are real. But there's, perhaps, a higher purpose. And mutatis mutandis that could apply actually everyone on the. But so, we could, perhaps, start here. </p><p>So, that--that's one thing I would say. And I've always found people at the (UNTRANSLATED) of the European data protection supervisor very, you know, very reasonable in this respect, open to--to debates also with--with the U.S. don't forget, they're really thinking about the next move after the GDPR.  </p><p>So, this conference they had in European Parliament, this the mother of all privacy conferences was already thinking about digital ethics, you know, because the ink is hardly dry on the GDPR. And they're already thinking about, okay, what's wrong with it? How can we improve it? I think we will see a paradigm shift in the long run where we have to give up on some of the core concepts of GDPR, by private opinion, but it's, for example, you know, informed consent purpose specification, use limitation. </p><p>Even the notion of a personal data. You know, all of these can--the key concepts may--may be the wrong way and not be sustainable for the rest of remainder of the 21st century. So, we have to, without giving up on the protection of individuals, that--that remains a big concern. </p><p>So, the other thing I wanted to say response to you was that actually I very much like this idea that your--your suggestion there is just a lot of democratic local experimentation going on as a source of innovation. And so, so we have people here trying to come to grips with a particular problem. They do it in their own way. They--they draw upon resources that are not accessible to others. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Right. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: And they may come up with really interesting suggestions that could be leveraged in and used on a federal or on a--on a higher level. So, that is something that you don't want to lose, I would say. That's a very interesting, you know, set resources that--that a system may have. </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, Cam, I want to just, real quick to just jump to you though on that concept because the U.S. is actually trying to develop a federal umbrella. And if we look at the state of California as an experiment, there is a conversation on whether or not that experiment should impact what federal legislation looks like or vice versa, right.  </p><p>And so, the question I have for you is, you know, are we going to see--you know, what is the effect of states like California implementing their own privacy legislation. There's already 50 states that have it. But, speak to us in the context of the U.S. </p><p>KERRY: Sure. Well, both GDPR and the California law-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: --Yeah-- </p><p>KERRY: -- are sort of powerful drivers for federal legislation for, I think, practically variety of reasons. I mean, certainly the drive to have federal preemption, a single standard, as the E.U. did with the GDPR and make a single market out of the U.S. is certainly there. But I think--I think the things that go beyond, as--I think a recognition that there is a trust gap that needs to be addressed and, you know, having a set of standards that level the playing field in terms of individual expectations would be a kind of seal of approval on--on company practices in--in handling data. </p><p>And--and I think, you know, as well as sort of for the U.S., you know, we, right now, we have no answer to the GDPR. And I think there's a recognition that, you know, we can't sort of go out into the discussion in the world and--and, you know, without a horse to--to ride, so to speak. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Right. </p><p>KERRY: And I think you know, also recognition alongside this that we do need to engage more. I mean, it's unfortunate T-TIP to translate Trade and Investment Partnership fell by the wayside because that was a vehicle to address, I think, a lot of the common digital economy issues and some of the regulatory barriers that could present Balkanization threats. </p><p>Unfortunately, you know, we see some of that, I think the new copyright directive may have some impacts towards that. We've seen some people make the decision that whatever business they had in the E.U. was not worth the regulatory cost of GDPR compliance. So, they've pulled out. </p><p>But, you know, we can, I think, get to common standards. And, you know, I think that that is part of the drive in--in federal legislation. And, you know, Bilyana quoted Heather Gerken talking about sort of state experimentation arriving in a point where it can be adopted as a national standard. Maybe California is that point. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Right, right. So, Bilyana, I want to go back to you just as we wrap up this part of it. And in a few minutes, I'm actually going to take Q and A from the audience, we'll have time for one or two questions. Again, remember to tweet if we don't get to your question, put it out there and the Twitter verse. We'll try to answer it. </p><p>So, looking ahead and looking globally given that these are out there, are there opportunities to do this sort of multilateral harmonization of these rules, in your view? Is this a conversation--we've heard some starting points, maybe there's something to be gleaned from GDPR, as well as, with the state of California? But is there something else we should be looking to get to that harmonization? </p><p>PETKOVA: Right. Well, certainly at first sight on the global level, one can observe a certain convergence that data prize these standards. To go back to Jeroen's point also about bridging these two worlds, the E.U. and the U.S., what Cam was saying. </p><p>So, this is triggered by adequacy requirement the pre-existing E.U. directive and now also in the GDPR. And Australia's (INAUDIBLE) Graham Greenleaf has found that there 20--120 countries right now that have enacted E.U. style data privacy laws, and 30 more are considering such bills. </p><p>So, as also Ted was mentioning more recently, Brazil enacted a statute called the general data protection regulation, and a comprehensive privacy statute that has looked for inspiration at the E.U. model is well on the way to the logistic process in India, after two court decisions there challenging massive national biometric identification system. </p><p>So, also Japan delete assigned adequacy decision on data protection with the E.U. commission, and in almost one year long negotiation process. So, finally also, we see also some privacy protections for the private sector in that country. </p><p>So, on the one hand, we see these convergence, however, the title is in the detail and it seems that there remain lot of divergencies in the concrete measures to be taken by the different countries that use the GDPR as a starting point, but still they are not replicating it. Each country is coming up with its own model. </p><p>So, I think aspirations for a global single standard will still face a lot of hurdles, essentially, someone needs to make it their lifelong project to work on that kind of standard. So, what are we left with in the immediate future? </p><p>So, one way forward could be that we see an attempt to extend the interoperability standard of what the privacy shield is, this framework for data exchanges is between the E.U. and U.S. an example of voluntary adheres to principles by companies and governments on a larger scale. </p><p>At the same time, we might also see some attempts for concretizing the interoperability and existing legal frameworks to joint enforcement actions. So, the GDPR, for example, explicitly favors this approach by giving what is known as the European data protection board, this body that is comprised of the data protection authorities of the cute 28 member states with the task of promoting exchange of knowledge and documentation with supervisory authorities worldwide. </p><p>So, that might be also one venue. And then, in addition, we see in the field of AI, for example, OECD, the organizations for--the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development basing parties that will come up in May with guidelines on AI. So, EPIC for example, has been heavily involved in that softball effort, which is important as it can serve for candidacy national legislation. So, civil society groups like the Electronic Information Privacy Center has also have weighed in in that process. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah. So, this is so tough for me because those of you who know I moderate, I want more time because I think we have to really go into enforcement. But before I open up to, again one or two questions, I do have to sort of end my part of moderating privilege on this discussion of AI and emerging technologies, right. </p><p>So, we sort of talked about the framing of privacy, how we could potentially get to some level of harmonization. What are some starting points? Where do we differ? But AI seems to be a different animal, right, because you're looking at this combination of risk space assessments combined with some harmed space approaches because at the center of it, I love the way that you frame it, are humans. </p><p>The work that I do, we have a paper coming out on algorithmic bias. These are real concerns that are going to, I think, affect the way that we see the evolution of technology and sort of getting to that gray area where there are human ethical concerns. What does a framework look like under those cases? </p><p>You've pointed out differences everyone around countries. Are we going to find ourselves in the same debate in terms of, you know, multilateral agreements around this, use cases? How do we ensure that these technologies are not weaponized? </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: Very hard questions very, relevant questions. </p><p>TURNER LEE: I know, and we only have a few more minutes for Q and A, but please, take your time. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: So, what do you see if you--if you--if you look at the landscape of all these kind of white papers and all these manifestoes and all these list of principles that are produced. There's a lot of convergence. If you look at, I triple E, for example, here, based here in the U.S., this is ethically aligned design. </p><p>So, they came and visit us in Delft, and we had conversations and we are providing input to their sets of principles, you have the Asilomar principles. And so, so everyone seems to be identifying all of those concerns, and also making those kind of distinctions that you were making. </p><p>And I think that people also realize that we've had this difficult trajectory and that it's very similar to--to it. And, of course, it is related because there is so much kind of overlaps. So, and everyone is realizing that there are great benefits to be had from this technology. So, I--I am fairly optimistic. I'm receiving treatment for that, but it's-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Okay, I think--we have a of a chance, for example, the clear initiative that Deputy Mayor mentioned that is setting up its headquarters and the Hague that is 7,000 AI researchers in Europe. I received just yesterday, I talked to the one that is heading this up from Stanford to have a collaboration going. </p><p>So, the same initiatives that Henry Kissinger attended, I think it was last week, it's kind of a launcher to kick off a huge initiative, I think these things--and we need to foster that, of course. I mean, you don't leave these people to their own devices but, you know, foster those kind of--of debates and dialogues that would be, I think, wise thing to do. And there's no better way to predict where the world is going than just create then make it vented. </p><p>TURNER LEE: And, will Cam, will privacy legislation address the concerns of AI? </p><p>KERRY: No. I think only in small ways. A lot of--a lot of the issues are--are different. I mean, I think they've certainly addressed some of the ways that personal data is used in AI, but I don't think that privacy legislation can or should try to address some of the fundamental crosscutting issues that have been identified.  </p><p>And I guess I come out a little bit where bit at the end here like you said let a thousand flowers bloom in terms of developing the codes and approaches. And somewhat, my take, but I think the principal that has also has been articulated, vigilance certainly needs to be an important part of the discussion. </p><p>TURNER LEE: That's right. And when you said that a flower--let a thousand flowers bloom though, I don't want the baby in the carriage to be hid, okay, I just want to be real clear. We got to be careful about that. But let me close with you Bilyana in terms of the whole concept then of GDPR and AI. Will that framework--were coming up on the one-year anniversary, will that framework at least begin to inform us on what we should be looking at around AI and emerging technologies? </p><p>PETKOVA: Right, while also, tough question. One year is, I think, still not enough to be able to assess appropriate statute, given its complexity and comprehensiveness. And also, European commission is under no obligation, unlike what the privacy shield to publish these annual assessments that we see for that other framework. </p><p>So, that's on the foremost of things. Now, I think that gives a lot of space for independent external evaluators to step in. So, hopefully we'll see more in the future. Of course, the GDPR answer to the is through article 22 which imposes some requirements for explicit consent when the data subject, the individual is affected either legally or by decisions that significantly affect the individual. </p><p>So, you can think about where you are targeting in that sense, for example, and many other areas so that there are some protections also their decision can be also contested or can be appealed. Now, how this is going to play out, whether there is going to be always human in the loop or sometimes we might see also that the decision is contested, for example, by checking with another algorithm. I think that would also be--it will vary a from area to area, so total. </p><p>TURNER LEE: That's with explain ability issues will come into effect. Okay, so, I'm going to try something a little different because I'm just going to take five minutes for questions and answers. That's all we have. So, I'm going to ask for a question, but I'm going--if more than two hands raise, I'm going to take two questions at one time and I'm going to throw it to the panel as part of their closing. Is that okay, Ted? Just to make sure we answer a couple of questions. </p><p>So, just raise your hand if you have a question and I'm going to tell you--I'm going to pick one from this side and this side, I'm going to do it the way we do in the US. I'm going to close my eyes and put my hand out, and if your hand is the one in the direction of my finger, you're going to have your question to ask. And certainly, let's continue the conversation on twitter.  </p><p>Okay, so, on this side going to put my hands on my eyes and I'm going to pick this gentleman right there is the first question. And let me do the second question on this side, and I'll ask that you keep your question brief so that we can actually have the panelist answer. And I will do young lady with the black on, okay, as a second question. So, let's do one question, say your name and if you all can just write that question down and I will have them answered both at the same time. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. I'll try to be very brief. Michael Tuador (PH) from the European Parliament Liaison Office. So, how do we balance out your comments about and cause for increased harmonization in terms of global governance for the Internet with the reality of the normative landscape, which most of the times is predicated on unilateral extra territorialism?  </p><p>And we've seen that on the U.S. side, for example, with the Cloud Act. We've seen that on the E.U. side, for example, with the GDPR, I'm thinking of the Senate scope of article 3 and also the coming, possibly E.U. evidence proposal and other commission proposals. Thank you. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Okay. You all have that. Just hold just for a moment. It was question there, but okay now let's go--I don't know my exercise will work. Okay, and second question. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you so much. I'm Marina Fezel (PH), an Afghan-American journalist. And I would like to ask you to address this on a couple of fronts, one is the international front. I mean, I heard you speak about President Putin being quite a leader in this arena. We are still in the midst of sorting through the results of what sort of meddling was done here. </p><p>In the length of time that it takes to go through those issues, by the time we know what were the consequences and the modalities, bear results for us to see the Mueller report, etc. is there a risk of damage to democracy? How do you view the time frame that it takes? </p><p>You're all talking about a longer trajectory of how policies can be formed to a fact international entities vis-a-vis to this, but in the meantime, what do we, global citizens do when our phones are taken by ghost operators, for example, whether we're journalist, whether we are business executives, whoever we are? Are there entities being formed already to deal with these things to inform the citizens to cope with the consequences and do the best they can? </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, okay good. I think I got question. I want to make sure we have enough time. Okay, so there are two questions. You can take both, you can take one. Let's end with her question and let's go to this whole question around unilateral concerns and the fact that there are competing approaches even in the distribution of power, right, around some of these areas, and we never get to harmonization. </p><p>KERRY: Sure. Well, I think we need to be mindful in terms of the E.U. U.S. discussion that if we have some very powerful common interest, it's economic interest in what is the world's largest trade relationship, strategic interest. And I don't believe that the AI and technology discussion should be turned into an arms race. </p><p>But is the threat that I think we have common interest, being on the same side if--if that does happen. And certainly, overarching this is, you know, common political interests to protect democracy, to ensure that AI technologies are not turned into the instrument of authoritarianism that Jeroen described. And I think, you know, those are enormously powerful common interest. And I think it behooves us to work for ways to harmonize--we're not going to--we are not going to be identical.  </p><p>So, I was very interested in Jeroen's comments about where things may go with--with the GDPR. But we need to be having that discussion, be pursuing it to actively--at all levels, not just a governmental discussion, but across all sectors. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Um-hmm. You want to go into it? </p><p>PETKOVA: I'll just jump and quickly. I largely agree with what Cam was saying. So, I think that there are more common interest than the divergencies. So, also with both Europeans and Americans are, I think, deeply concerned with the Chinese scoring system, credit scoring system, and the roll out the technologies on that scale.  </p><p>And so, we should start with, perhaps, the commonalities. And here, think of a secret scoring of travelers and police, and proprietary techniques also in the community law justices, Jeroen was saying. So, there are common interest there, I think that we can use as starting points. And it's also where civil society groups are playing a role on both sides of the Atlantic for exposing some of these mechanisms to the sort of public and pushing back against them. So, perhaps you want to. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: Yeah. </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, I'm going to have you actually end up on that last question. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>TURNER LEE: So, jump in if you want to say something, but end up on that last question, yeah. </p><p>VAN DEN HOVEN: With both of these. Yeah, to your question, which is a very pertinent and very relevant one is to say that in Europe we are thinking about those institutions that could surveille monitors kind of democracy observatories. For example, Macron has asked in his letter, which was ridiculed a little bit, so, he wrote to (UNTRANSLATED) or citizens of Europe calling for digital re-nations. </p><p>And he drew attention to this also looking forward to the European elections. And there is a lot of anxiety around how, you know, certain parties will meddle and will try to influence that. And indeed, I think your point is very, very relevant. How can we, you know, investigate and look at these things, assure ourselves of the fact of these things have been done properly and--and in accordance with the rule of law. </p><p>So, that is something that we have to create new institutions. We have to invent them. So, we are thinking also in the Netherlands about setting up the unit or an agency that would, you know, over--oversee elections and especially this--this online vigilance of seeing how, you know, maybe we're trying to manipulate and influence unjustifiably the--the voters. So, yeah. </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah. So, I can say this as we continue to close. I mean, obviously this conversation today from the beginning to this, now end, really points to the fact that technology continues to outpace policymaking. </p><p>Whatever front that you're on that were going to continue to be, in I think this race to ensure that we actually harmonize, you know, not only distinct approaches distribution power, you know, where civil society fits in with regards to freedom of expression. </p><p>And I think the most important thing is we have this race where people fit in to this equation where they are not hurt in the process of technologies evolution. I just want to say thank you today's panelist. Please join me in thanking them. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Before we leave, please join me in thanking the Deputy Mayor for actually addressing us. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I want to say to all of you that you already probably know the Brookings continues to work on these issues in our foreign policy program as well as our other programs in which Cam and are associated. Continue to follow our discussions. Continue the conversation on twitter. And enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VST-CB11-JDPT-T464-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

I see lots of old friends in the audience and several new ones. And it's a pleasure to invite you to our event with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo Pacific security affairs, Randall Shriver. I'm delighted to welcome Randy back to Brookings. We've been fortunate to engage him on several aspects of our policy research over the past decade and while he's been serving in the administration since 2017. And Randy, thank you for your service to our country and the important role that you play in this administration.  </p><p>Randall Shriver was appointed as Assistant Secretary of Defense by President Donald Trump on January 8, 2018 previously having served as deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, under which portfolio he covered China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia. All the easy stuff. Earlier, he held the role of Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary of State from 2001 to 2003 and also served as an active duty Naval intelligence Officer deployed in support of operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  </p><p>Beyond his government career, Randy has been a leading thinker on a range of issues that play into the U.S.-China relationship over two decades, and he has been a robust 40s voice on the future of that relationship, asking critical questions to help manage and shape American policy in the region. And with that background, we couldn't ask for anybody better to join us today as we continue to roll out our project on global China, assessing China's growing role in the world. I think we all recognize now that China has emerged as a truly global actor, impacting every region in the world on almost every issue. It's cast aside its strategy of hide and bide, and is now assertively seeking influence not only in Asia but will beyond.  </p><p>The effort of this project is to capture a baseline assessment of the trajectory that now expansive of that now expansive global role. It draws on our deep bench of East Asia and China as experts, but also pulls in the expertise of our institution security, strategy, regional technology, and economics scholars to try to capture the full scope of China's activity. It will focus on several key areas of research, strategic competition, great power rivalry, frontier technologies, China's influence in critical regions and China's approach to global governance and norms.  </p><p>Today, we'll have two sessions. Our--Michael Armacost Chair, Ryan Haas will chair a discussion with Randy following his keynote address, and then we'll have a panel that draws on three steps of the papers that are being launched or are still underway today. Audrye Wong, who contributed to an early set of papers on some young voices looking at the future of Chinese foreign policy, Cheng Li and Jamie Horsley, both here at Brookings looking at the domestic drivers of China's global influence, and Rush Doshi on strategic competition. All of which moderated by our own Tarun Chhabra, who is lurking someplace around here. There he is. </p><p>Before I invite Randy to the stage, to further notes for me. It is of course campaign season, which means that think tankers are off trying to influence political campaigns as well as doing their day jobs. And at Brookings, we disclose all of that. You can find on the website or on people's bios their campaign affiliations. They do that off-campus and on their own time, but it is an important part of how we think about policy impact to try to put our research into the lifeblood of the campaigns. As of now, we have scholars advising the Biden, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg campaigns. And of course, we also have scholars on leave working in the Trump administration.  </p><p>All of this is part of a long tradition that has seen scholars from the foreign policy program serve in the NSC, State or Defense Department of every president since Nixon, both Republican and Democratic. Of course, Nixon tried to fire Baba (PH), so we didn't really do him. But for the rest, we do. Second, I would like to thank the Ford Foundation for its generous support to this project, which has not only allowed us to do this comprehensive research, but to communicate it broadly to the scholarly community and to policymakers who would hopefully use the evidence that will provide and will find to right set and to have a baseline approach and empirical approach to China policy, which I think we all understand will be a defining feature of American foreign policy in the coming generations. And with that, let me warmly welcome Randy Shriver to the stage to give us some opening remarks. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>SHRIVER: Great. Well, thanks, Bruce, and thank you for the invitation to return to Brookings. And I really appreciate being part of this--this rollout of this impressive project. I've been following some of the papers that have already been released, but hearing your two year plan to help us really both deep dive and relate baseline this enormous challenge is really encouraging to know that you've got this project underway. And thanks for allowing me to speak as a part of that.  </p><p>So what I thought I would do is talk about our approach to China, our competition. And what I thought I would do is go into a little bit more detail on sort of the fundamentals of this policy. A lot of people, you know, sort of jump right in to we are in strategic competition or in a competitive environment without really even talking about the fundamentals, what are we competing for, what's--how is--how is competition implemented, how is it different from confrontation or conflict? And so if I could take just a few moments to do a bit of a deeper dive and explain our perspective from the department of defense, I hope it would set the stage for a discussion that would follow both with Ryan and with the audience.  </p><p>So with respect to our strategic competition, we believe that it is a major element of our overall national security strategy and international strategy. We feel as though we are in competition fundamentally because we have different visions, different aspirations, different views of what regional and global security architecture should look like. If you're familiar with our national security strategy and national defense strategy and our DOD Indo Pacific strategy, you'll know that we talk about a free and open Indo Pacific. Our free and open Indo Pacific vision is founded upon what we regard as enduring principles and principles that are near universal and widely shared. And believe that they're are principles that benefit all countries, if countries embrace them. These include respect for national sovereignty no matter a country's size, fair, free, and reciprocal trade, rule of law and rules-based order and peaceful dispute resolution.  </p><p>We fundamentally believe each nation must be free to determine its own course, and we believe that all countries can both benefit and--as well as print participate in preserving a rules-based order. We observe that China, under the leadership of the CCP has a different vision. And as I said, different aspirations. It is increasingly developing the tools to pursue its vision and seems willing to accept more and more friction in pursuit of that vision. We are competing with China, therefore, because we see China's leaders have assessed that they are in competition with us, both our ideas and our capabilities. Globally, China seeks to shape a world consistence consistent with its authoritarian model and national goals.  </p><p>We see that domestic governance in China as a resilient as a result of CC--CCP rule is increasingly authoritarian and less respectful for human rights and dignity. And that they are even beginning to export some of these tools such as facial recognition software and nationwide surveillance capabilities to other countries who are learning from China's governance model. We are concerned that China has grown more willing, as I said, to apply pressure against other countries and accept friction in pursuit of its vision.  </p><p>We observe China using influence operations to interfere in their domestic politics of other countries, undermining the integrity of elections and threatening internal stability using economic coercion, and we've seen certainly recent examples in countries such as Mongolia, Australia, and Canada. Promoting state-sponsored theft of other nations military and civilian technologies, exporting the most effective tools, as I said, from its domestic toolkit to other nations for surveillance and potential use of--for internal repression. We see them extending its military presence overseas and expanding the one belt one road initiative to include military ties with China. And we see deploying advance weapon systems to militarize disputed features despite pledges at the senior most level that they would not do so.  </p><p>In DoD, we focus on the military component of China's growing global activities and we take China at their word. They seek to be a world-class military by 2049, and they are making progress toward that goal. The department views military developments in China as seeking to erode U.S. military advantages. They are working to become a preeminent power in the Indo Pacific region while simultaneously undertaking plans to expand overseas presence and develop capability capabilities to sustain operations further from Chinese shores. We see China widening the PLA's operational reach to match what its leaders consider to be the global nature of China's economic and national interest.  </p><p>Press reporting indicates that China has sought to expand its military basing and access in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. Chairman's Xi Jinping himself has called for the completion of a security system for OBOR to strengthen, protection of its overseas interest to ensure the security of major overseas projects and personnel. China's defense minister has also cited OBOR as a framework for China to increase its military cooperation with other countries. While our competition with China takes place on various levels, at the most fundamental and basic level, what we are really competing for is to sustain a position within the regional and international system, which allows us to promote, support, and protect a liberal rules based order, whose institutions, rules, and norms have fostered peace for decades.  </p><p>And all of this matters because if the CCP and China were to be successful and its authoritarian approach were to become ascendant, the world could look much different. States will finally have less control of their political and economic decisions. Institutions could become less independent and less effective, such as ASEAN and other regional organizations. Freedom of the seas and overflight in the Indo Pacific may be challenged, the freedom of those--those bodies of water. We could also see a normalization of the lack of respect for individual and human rights. All of this portends a less free and less open and more unstable Indo Pacific region with high potential for these trends to manifest on a global scale.  </p><p>As I said, we view competition as being different than confrontation and conflict. A competitive strategy with China is not meant to lead us to conflict. For the United States, we seek to maintain competition as a stable deterrent that avoids conflict while we compete vigorously with China, our military to military contacts are aimed at reducing risks and promoting international norms and standards. We will cooperate with China where our interests align while competing within a rules-based framework where our interests diverge. And we will continue to call out China's behaviors that are counter to that rules-based order.  </p><p>So briefly, DOD's response and, as I said, changing our minds mindset, we seek to regain the advantage and play to our strengths. Our goal is to deter China from pursuing a faits accomplis and to improve our capacity to deter and prevail at the outset of a crisis. Meeting the China challenge requires this fundamental shift in mindset of our defense establishment. We are no longer in a period of overwhelming American dominance, but rather one in which our Armed Forces are adapting to fight against near peer competitors who are fielding increasingly sophisticated capabilities. Instead of expecting to dominate at opponent, our Armed Forces are learning to expect to be contested throughout a fight while achieving the political objectives set for them.  </p><p>Our national defense strategy and our Indo Pacific strategy within the department focuses on a couple of pillars that will be key enablers for us to succeed. Namely, the first two pillars of our national defense strategy, which include building a more lethal joint force and strengthening our alliances and partnerships. The first line of effort, preparing a more lethal and resilient joint force takes into account the scope and pace of our competitors ambitions and capabilities and prioritizes investment and modernizing key U.S. capabilities across a range of domains, our nuclear forces, space and cyber capabilities, missile-defense, and looks at how our force can be resilient and having more access options, dispersal opportunities, and adaptive basing.  </p><p>Within my office, we are also changing how we organize for long-term strategic competition. In June, our deputy secretary approved the establishment of a new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for China. This position is both outward looking and inward looking. The inward parts being to help us drive alignment on China across the department as we carry out our national defense strategy and its implementation. The second line of effort in our national defense strategy is strengthening alliances and attracting new partners. America's alliances and partnerships are a crucial and durable asymmetric advantage that no other country can match. For countries that valuate rules based order, the strongest way we can demonstrate our support for these principles is the action we take both individually and together to uphold a free and open region.  </p><p>Our alliances and partnerships are important for a myriad of reasons. For example, there is inherent trust and confidence building that comes with combined training and interoperability. Militaries that train together and trust one another are more adaptive, agile, interoperable, and survivable. In this vein, the department is expanding collaborative planning, prioritizing requests for U.S. military equipment sales to deepen interoperability and training for a high end combat missions in alliance bilateral and multilateral exercises. We look to strengthen both traditional partners and relationships such as Japan, and we are working to integrate our national defense strategy with Japan's national defense program guidelines, and we're also working very intensely and seriously on important emerging relationships such as with India, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.  </p><p>The 10 ASEAN nonmembers and U.S. Navy forces tested interoperability command-and-control and key maritime security tasks during our first ever annual--what we hope now is annual U.S. ASEAN Maritime exercise last month. We are also enhancing our engagement in areas such as the Pacific islands to preserve a free and open border and we have enhanced our engagement in the freely associated states and beyond in that regard.  </p><p>Beyond the Indo Pacific, the department is engaging allies and partners across the globe and we have brought the China challenge and our discussions in Europe and the Middle East, for example. China and others recognize our advantages are--and are actively working to disrupt our alliances and partnerships in these key areas, but we, nonetheless, see strong interest in greater alignment on these challenges from our partners. We are also exercising with our partners in real-world operations to include enforcement of the sanctions against North Korea. Japan and Yokosuka hosts the enforcement coordination cell, a command center of eight countries to include South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Japan, and France, who are all committed to enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions.  </p><p>We are also working in with our partners in the maritime spaces to include the South China Sea and are working with partners to build capacity through initiatives such as the Maritime security initiative, which has boosted key partner's abilities and helps them conduct maritime security and awareness operations. We are also part of a whole of government approach, which is Allied and partner centric response to China's expanding influence and coercion and their interest in acquiring and advantaging themselves in the high-tech area. We have ongoing deep conversations with our allies about protection of the innovation base and about the risks associated with new technologies such as 5G.  </p><p>To conclude, the unfolding long-term strategic competition with China is the defining challenge of our generation and we embrace that at DoD. Our current trajectory is largely driven by the ambitions and choices of Chairman and Xi and the CCP elite. The acquisition of capabilities to apply toward realizing those ambitions and the current policy choices and actions which demonstrate active pursuit of those ambitions. We remain open to changing this trajectory and our vision for a free and open Endo Pacific is in fact inclusive and affirmative for any country, China included, who choose to support the enduring principles embedded in our vision.  </p><p>But we should be clear that we do understand these to be consequential times and consequential decisions must be taken. The costs associated with complacency could be extremely high. But the benefits of competing well and competing to prevail are equally high. With that, I look forward to a conversation with Ryan and the questions and--and discussion that may follow. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>HASS: Well, first of all, Assistant Secretary, thank you for being here with us. Thank you for providing such a rich, nutritious overview of the work that is being done in your area of responsibility at the Pentagon. I want to give the audience a chance to jump in because I know there are a lot of questions that they would like to pose to you. But before I turn it over to--to this distinguished group, I did want to ask you a few scene setting questions building upon your comments today. First, you talked a bit about the U.S.-China military to military relationship. I was wondering if you could just sort of take us into the engine room a little bit of that. How is it working, and is it being insulated from ups and downs in the overall relationship, or is it a--a derivative of it? </p><p>SHRIVER: Well, we continue to hear from our Chinese interlocutors that they want them milled to mill relationship to be a stabilizing force in the overall relationship. We welcome that, so we have maintained a robust level of engagement to include high-level engagement. I think 2018 was the first year on record where there was both a Sec Def visit to China and a counterpart visit in the same calendar year. So by that metric, our engagement remains robust.  </p><p>Our focus is on the--how we engage with China in this context of overall competition. So that places a premium on confidence building measures, on safety of operations, so things like the military maritime consultative agreement, other measures that help us to ensure a safe operating environment while we know we operate in close proximity to one another with greater frequency, how we make sure there's no unintended incident or--or accident. So that continues. I plan to go to China next week, so our--our policy talks continue, our emphasis on confidence building measures and safety continues. So there are perturbations, but I see many old-timers in the audience. We are more insulated from--from the political ups and downs than we used to be, and I think that's a good thing. </p><p>HASS: I agree. That's great. Strategic competition was a theme of your presentation. It's also one of the themes of this event today. Can you talk to us a little bit about where that competition is felt most acutely in your day-to-day work, and also where you expect your successor 10 years from now, 2029 to feel the competition most acutely? </p><p>SHRIVER: So, I would say there's a--there's an inside aspect of that and then an external aspect. The inside aspect is we are doing a lot to drive the defense enterprise into alignment for this long-term competition. I mentioned that standing up of a new DASD. A lot of that is to help us internally with the joint staff and the services as they make their respective decisions to make sure that it's appropriate for the competition and the environment that we see. The external piece is, again, working with allies and partners. We do think that's an asymmetrical advantage that just can't be matched.  </p><p>And of course, also, some contested areas. South China Sea, some--some relationships that might be contested where China has ambitions where we want to invest more. So I mentioned the Pacific islands and parts of Southeast Asia. So it's playing out, you know, we're sort of building the airplane as we're flying it, if you will, because we are in a competitive environment now, but--but to get to your second part of your question, I think the work inside the enterprise is the work that will continue for quite some time because the nature of our business. We buy things, you know, big programs that last decades, and decisions now in 5, 10 years from now will have lasting impact.  </p><p>So we want to be investing wisely. I mentioned some of the new domains and areas of focus in my remarks, but it's a dynamic environment that could--that could change depending on the directions that China goes. I mean, that they will largely be a pacing competitor for these decisions, and we have to be dynamic and flexible and make those wise decisions along the way. </p><p>HASS: Yeah. You mentioned alliances. You've built a reputation as being a strong alliance manager, an advocate of strengthening our alliances. How are we doing? </p><p>SHRIVER: Well, I think we have a very strong demand signal from our partners. They want largely to--well, to generalize, we see a lot of interest in stronger defense and security relations with the United States. I think we are being resourced for that. And--and resource not only in budget terms, but how our senior most leaders are spending their time and attention. Secretary Esper just took his first trip to the Indo Pacific region as confirmed secretary. He is the second secretary in a row to do that. Secretary Mattis did the same.  </p><p>So I think we are--were making the investments, we got the demand signal, as I said, and were trying to meet countries where they are. We have more advanced and mature alliances. So I mentioned to Japan and the work that it's doing to align our national defense strategies and with the implementation of those will look like. We have emerging partners who are not allies but a place like Vietnam. We pulled at 92 percent favorable as a country in Vietnam. I've been to Vietnam five times. I'll be going next week and then I'll return with the secretary, so that will be seven trips to Vietnam in two years, if that's any metric.  </p><p>So I think we're doing okay. You know, we've got a region that China plays very prominently in and they have the ability to use economic weight and their own diplomacy, so it is a competitive environment. And then we have, you know, a different approach to issues like trade, which also, I think, some of our partners are trying to get their hands around and understand the trajectory of that. So you know, that's--that's part of the environment we work in. But I won't give us a grade, but I would say overall, we're doing pretty well on the partners and allies front. </p><p>HASS: Good. You mentioned polling. Vietnam is a bright spot. 92 percent favorable ratings other allies have a slightly different picture. Pew polling in our allies in the region has shown that supports for--or favorable ratings for China has gone down conservatively, but for the United States, it has gone down as well. This is evident in--primarily in Australia, but in other places as well. How does that affect your day-to-day job. </p><p>SHRIVER: Well, some of it is understandable. I mean, when you talk about burden sharing, that's a stress in the partnerships that will sometimes be reflected in public sentiment. But it's something that's important to the president and I think previous administrations as well, but I think this administration has been more aggressive in trying to pursue equitable burden sharing. Some of the countries, you know, we're going--Australia, I don't know the exact numbers, but I would guess we are going from high 80s favorable to low 80s, high 70s favorable. I mean, you can--you can fact checked me on that.  </p><p>Some places like the Philippines, you know, we have a different kind of leader there whose--who makes a lot of public commentary on the United States, yet we remain over 80 percent favorable in the Philippines. Maybe we are down historically, but still quite high. So it's an important metric, but it's not the only metric. We need to pursue, you know, the president's goals on burden sharing and things of that nature as we are doing what we think we need to do to compete with China. </p><p>HASS: Right. While we're on the topic of alliances, JapanKorea is a relationship that appears to be in a downward spiral at the moment. You've spoken publicly about this recently. Can you just give us a sense of where we are, where the bottom is in this freefall, and what role the United States can or should play in--in seeking to bring our allies back together? </p><p>SHRIVER: Well, I was meeting with a prominent Chinese scholar. I won't say his--I won't mention his name, but he remarked on the growing tensions between Japan and South Korea and he said China is very pleased about this.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>And I said--I said, \"Well, why is China pleased about this?\" He said, \"Isn't it obvious?\" So I think what we need to continue to remind our allies is that the countries that are benefiting from their tension is China, Russia, North Korea, and that's not a good place to be. We at the Defense Department to maintain trilateral relations. I believe this morning, at least I--well, I won't--I won't comment on that because I'm not sure it actually came off. But we will soon have an opportunity at ASEAN defense minister meeting plus where we'll have a trilateral meeting at the ministerial level. Secretary Esper will meet with ROK and Japan. That happened at Shangri-La with then acting secretary Shanahan.  </p><p>We have regular interactions at my level, including we last met on May 9 at--in Seoul. It was one of the days where there was a missile launch, missile test and the South Korean defense minister called the delegation leaders up into his office, previously unplanned, and said this is why we need to strengthen our defense cooperation and trilateral work. And he said it in Japanese, by the way. South Korean defense minister is a Japanese speaker studying at the Japanese air war College.  </p><p>So we are trying our best to insulate the defense and security relationship from the political tensions that obviously are present. I think one of the reasons we spoke out on GSOMIA is because that was spilling into the security trilateral work in an unhelpful way. But overall, I think we're doing okay. It's a tough environment for the defense ministries respectively in Tokyo and Seoul because of where their political leadership is on these things. But I think we ultimately are going to be driven together because of the prevailing security interest and security environment. I don't know where rock-bottom is or how much time it can take, but I do see so much that pull us together.  </p><p>If you--if you give the list of things that the ROK and Japan themselves would acknowledge they agree on, rules-based order, respect for human rights and human dignity, work in Southeast Asia on health issues, development assistance, you know, the list is quite long. So we'll play a role, if we can. I mean, there's some suggestion we haven't been engaged enough at a high level. I can tell you Secretary Esper in both capitals spent considerable time on this. Secretary Pompeo has. Former National Security Advisor Bolton, before he left office, spent time on this.  </p><p>And we're open to other ways we could be a constructive party here. What typically happens is one country asks us to go straighten out the other country and tell them why they're wrong. So should we be a more active mediator? If both sides can agree on what that looks like, and if it could be a constructive role. But we're open to finding ways to help bring the two sides closer together. </p><p>HASS: If I could just ask one more question, and then I will turn it over to our colleagues here. Taiwan. Taiwan's an issue that you've spent considerable time on. You've thought about deeply. You've worked on it for many years. Right now Beijing is intensifying pressure on Taiwan, particularly in the run up to a presidential election in January. What should the U.S. response be to that intensifying pressure? </p><p>SCHRIVER: Well, I think we've got the framework through the Taiwan Relations Act that gives a lot of flexibility to enhance certain aspects of our approach. We've made some decisions recently on security assistance that was consistent with the law and the growing threat from China. I think this is a particularly tense period because of the election. So we're doing certain things to support a fellow democracy and carrying out a free, fair and non-coerced election. So there's, you know, I think very little doubt that the Chinese will seek to meddle in that election. They've tried it in each of Taiwan's previous elections.  </p><p>In 1996 it was missile exercises. In 2000 it was a finger wagging lecture from (INAUDIBLE). This time I think it's a little more sophisticated with the use of social media and cyber means. So we're supporting Taiwan as a fellow democracy interested in seeing free, fair, un-coerced elections, particularly on the cyber--on the cyber piece.  </p><p>But over the longer stretch, certainly we'll need to continue to be that good security partner, good economic partner and preserve space for Taiwan to keep its unique status until the two sides are in a better place to work things out between them. </p><p>HASS: Thank you. I'd like to turn it to--open now to any questions. All right, we'll take two or three at a time. We'll start out with this gentleman with the tie. </p><p>SCHRIVER: Can you help me remember if we're doing two or three at a time? </p><p>QUESTION: Hi there, Dave Lawler from Axios. Assistant Secretary, you said in your remarks that China recognizes the advantages that the U.S. has in its alliances and partnerships and is seeking to undermine or counter that. I was wondering if you could expand on that idea. Thanks. </p><p>HASS: Thank you. We can go to the gentleman in the back. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary. (INAUDIBLE) China Review News Agency of Hong Kong. Assistant Secretary, did you watch the web live of the military parade in Beijing today? What is your take on that? Thank you. </p><p>HASS: Okay. And let's take one more question from this lady with the red sweater. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is (INAUDIBLE) from Radio Free Asia, and I have a question on North Korea. The United States and North Korea are going to resume the (INAUDIBLE) negotiations this Saturday, and how would you assess the U.S. China cooperation on getting North Korea to give up the nuclear weap--nuclear programs? And well actually the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his United Nations speech mentioned about the sanctions relief to North Korea. So how do you assess the U.S. China cooperation on North Korea? </p><p>HASS: Thank you. So we have a question about North Korea, military parade and alliances. </p><p>SCHRIVER: Okay. Well, just in order, on military alliances, it relates to the comment that I conveyed from the Chinese scholar that China benefits when there is tension between our allies and tension between us and an ally, and as a result will seek to drive wedges and find those opportunities. A lot of times it's through their economic weight. A lot of times it's about, you know, in the information space there's quite a bit about the United States being, you know, an unreliable partner, a sort of capricious power who, of course, will be drawn back into the Middle East, and you know, this interest in the region is fleeting.  </p><p>And so you know, they do it in a variety of ways. You know, I think that's just part of the overall competitive environment and why it doesn't bother me, as assistant secretary that places a premium on our alliance relationships and providing that reassurance, and explaining where the benefit is in continuing a strong alliance and keeping it moving forward. That's fine. That's a burden I carry with no hesitation. The military parade or the national day events, I went home and spent time with my four kids and family. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I did not watch it. The--I'm seeing some reports on it. It seems like there's an impressive display, and it's meant to send a signal, I suppose, internally and externally, so we'll do the postgame analysis on it, but I think it's in line with expectations. And then the last question was about-- </p><p>HASS: North Korea. </p><p>SCHRIVER: North Korea and China's cooperation in particular. I think as Under Secretary Rood said yesterday in public, we believe China can do a little better on the sanctions enforcement and cooperating with us in an overall effort to get North Korea to the negotiating table in a constructive way.  </p><p>We've seen some slippage on sanctions enforcement, and we are willing to work with China to strengthen that enforcement effort. I've said this--probably people have heard this story, but Secretary Shanahan, then acting secretary, went to Shangri-La, and he presented Minister of Defense Wei with a gift. He said Minister, I have a gift for you. He was very pleased with that, and then he handed him a picture book of North Korean illegal, illicit ship-to-ship transfers happening in Chinese territorial waters.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That was the gift. But the gift came with an offer. We'd be happy to work with you on curbing this. We can hand off targets at your 12 nautical mile sovereign territory and hand it over to you. We can do something more robust if that's of interest. We'd like to work with China on this, but right now what we see is actually Chinese vessels shadowing our forces that are trying to enforce the sanctions rather than enforcing the sanctions themselves. And so we hope that they can change the course of that and do a little better on sanctions enforcement. </p><p>HASS: Thank you. We have time, I think, for two or so more questions. We'll start out with this gentleman here. </p><p>QUESTION: David Little (PH) with Herding Cats (PH). Is China trying to insert its role into the conflict between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir, and how they are doing that? </p><p>HASS: Okay. This woman over here. </p><p>QUESTION: My name's Liz Kim (PH). I'm a reporter with Voice of America. Assistant Secretary, you said earlier that China was happy about South--frictions about South Korea and Japan, and my question is more about bilateral relationship between U.S. and South Korea. The two countries have been suspending the large-scale military exercise for long, and recently South Korea has requested the U.S. to expedite the handover of the more than half of the bases of the United States military in Korea (PH). Does that send wrong signal to China that the weakening sign of U.S. and South Korea relationship? </p><p>HASS: So we have a question on I think India, Kashmir and South Korea. </p><p>SCHRIVER: Okay. Well, China has a long-standing relationship with--with Pakistan, and they have growing competition with India. I think India seeks a stable relationship with China. We have an important visitor this week after Prime Minister Modi's big event in Texas, and then his work at the UN Foreign Minister Jaishankar has stayed behind, and we're having consultations with him, and we've talked about the relationship with China. They want a stable relationship with China, but there's no doubt that there is growing concern and competition there as well. So I think on a range of issues to include Kashmir, China has leaned toward Pakistan.  </p><p>They've supported Pakistan in international fora. There is some discussion about whether or not Kashmir would be taken up in the UN, China would support that. But in terms of something beyond that or more active, I don't see it. I think many have concerns that Pakistan keep a lid on militant groups that might conduct cross-border activities as a result of the Kashmir decisions, and I don't sense that China wants that kind of conflict or would support that. So I think it's mostly diplomatic and political support.  </p><p>With respect to South Korea and our relationship, you know, it is a long-standing deep alliance and we have issues from time to time, but it's a very strong alliance. When we look at something like OPCON transfer, I mean the remarkable thing is we are pursuing it and talking about it. I mean, we're talking about one of the most dangerous areas in the world, and we're actually involved in a process that will ultimately lead to South Korea being in charge of combined forces that include U.S. forces. That's a pretty significant statement of confidence in the alliance.  </p><p>Now we think it has to be conditions based because of the seriousness of the security environment there and the need to ensure that we're as capable and prepared as possible. And so when we look at things like command structure, when we look at things like certain key capabilities for that contingency, we're going to be pretty insistent that South Korea acquires those capabilities before we agree to the transfer and not be tied to any political--political calendar.  </p><p>On the exercises, we made some adjustments. President Trump felt that it was important to make an adjustment to give our diplomats space to work on this issue. I would just tell you that in a combined environment what you really want to stress and test is decision-making, how you, in a crisis, make decisions in a combined environment, and you can do that through simulation and through war gaming and command post type exercises. We can train on all the other mission essential tasks in ways that are lower profile, some off the Peninsula, some just smaller elements, training on the mission essential tasks.  </p><p>So I think of General Abrams were here--in fact, I know if he were here because he's testified before Congress, we have made these adjustments to give our diplomats space but still maintain high readiness, still ready to fight tonight and still ready for the emerging challenges. If there are further adjustments, which I'm not aware there is any plan to do that, we'd want to maintain the same kind of readiness. And again, it's really focused on the decision-making combined environment where we need to be excellent. And so I think we're able to do that. </p><p>HASS: Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you for spending time with us this morning. I promised your staff that I would allow you to return to your day job at 10:15, and that time has come. But on behalf of all of my colleagues, thank you for giving us such a clear and valuable insight into what's happening in the region. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>SCHRIVER: Thanks. Appreciate it. </p><p>HASS: And we will have our next panel join us on stage momentarily. </p><p>CHHABRA: Everyone, thanks for being with us today. My name is Tarun Chhabra. I'm a fellow with our Project on International Order and Strategy and also (INAUDIBLE) Center for Security and Emerging Technology. We really have a stellar panel to reflect both on the remarks that you just heard from Assistant Secretary Schriver, and also to talk a little bit more about China's growing global influence. We're not going to have any prepared remarks. We're going to jump right in. But before I do, it is Brookings, and I want to hawk the papers that we just published.  </p><p>So the papers that we published in this tranche of the project are focused on domains of strategic competition and then the domestic drivers behind some of China's foreign policy moves. So among those papers today that I hope you'll take a look at, we have Dan Byman and Israa Saber writing about China's approach to counterterrorism policy, including what it's doing in Xinjiang today; Mike O'Hanlon who is writing about China in the gray zone. He has a paper focused particularly on what escalation could look like in the Senkaku Islands. Caitlin Talmadge has written a book about nuclear competition between the United States and China. David Dollar has a paper about China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly focused in sub-Saharan Africa as a case study. And Mara Karlin and Leah Dreyfuss have written a paper about China's overseas base--basing ambitions.  </p><p>And then on the domestic drivers front, we have with us today Cheng Li who has written about Xi's transformation as a populist and what that means for China's foreign policy. Jamie has written a great paper on the shift in China's legal development and the growing role of the party in that. And then Rush has contributed to a prior--prior tranche in this series, which was focused on continuity and change in China's foreign policy and what role President Xi has played in it. And so has Audrye, as well, where her focus has been on economic statecraft.  </p><p>So let's jump right in. And Rush, I want to start with you because I think a lot of current debate about the United States' policy toward China and also how many other countries around the world are reacting to China's rise really turns on what you think China wants, what kinds of resources and risk China is willing to wager to achieve some of those ambitions, which is essentially a debate about what many would call China's grand strategy. And there's a lot of debate about what that grand strategy is.  </p><p>So I want to pose to you a question that has three parts. So the first is, tell us first what the contours of that debate about China's grand strategy look like. Second, what are some signposts that we should be looking for, particularly in the domains of strategic competition that we're focusing on today, whether that's in economic and infrastructure development, or security competition, or the clash of values. And third, picking up on some remarks that the assistant secretary made this morning, you know, he said the current trajectory of U.S. China relations is really being driven by President Xi. So tell us a little bit about what--how Xi has shifted China's grand strategy, if he has. </p><p>DOSHI: Sure. Thanks, Tarun. So the first question is sort of basically about grand strategy. It's a pretty abstract term. I think we all kind of know what we mean when we use that term. I think of it, and I think many of us think of it as the coordination of multiple different instruments of statecraft to advance an overarching strategic objective. And that coordination is what makes grand strategy grand. It's not just the objective. It's the coordination because that coordination is extremely hard to pull off, and when that coordination is undertaken by a country with a $12 trillion economy, rapidly modernizing military force, robust information influence operations, it has pretty significant implications.  </p><p>So that's what we mean by grand strategy. And why it matters is precisely because it's so hard to do, when you pull it off you can reshape sort of global politics. So there is a debate right now about whether China has a grand strategy, and I think that you really can divide that debate into two categories. On the one hand you have individuals who would say that it really doesn't have a grand strategy. I call them the skeptics. And on the other side you've got people who might say that it does have a grand strategy, or the believers. And I'd say that the believers, people who believe China has a grand strategy, have not really attempted true persuasion, and the skeptics yet remain unpersuaded.  </p><p>And so why is that the case? We have had a lot of works come out recently arguing that China has a long-term plan, but a lot of those works don't really get deep in the weeds. They're kind of more commercial works. They're kind of a little more glib. They're not really getting into Chinese sources. They're not really looking at Chinese behavior in a serious, rigorous way.  </p><p>Now on the other side, the people who don't think China has a grand strategy will say it's just too complicated; we don't think that China even knows what it wants. They'd say that it doesn't have a clear decision-making process that makes it easy for them to actually implement whatever they decide they do want, that there's vested interest that corrupt the pursuit of national interests, that there's nationalism which occasionally prevents China from pursuing a more focused, strategic set of objectives. Now, I don't agree with all of those objections. I think that China does have a grand strategy, but that's the current debate.  </p><p>Tarun, you asked sort of what the signposts we should look for. How do we know who is right? How do we know if China has a grand strategy? I think there are three things you look for. First, you look at how they think about strategies. That's grand strategic concepts. Do they have a set of ideas about the ends, the ways and the means to accomplish strategic objectives and how they should be combined? Then you look at capability. Can they pull it off? It's really hard to pull off a grand strategy. Do they have the ability to override vested interests, parochial interests, etc.?  </p><p>And finally, you look at conduct. Are they actually taking action consistent with what we think those concepts are? And I think across all three the answer is yes, and hopefully I can get into the weeds a little bit later, but I want to answer the questions at the top level first. What would we expect to see if China really had a grand strategy? Well, one question, one big debate is are its focuses primarily regional, or are they increasingly global? Does China pursue kind of regional primacy, regional dominance, or does it aspire to displace the United States globally? That's a big question. I don't think it's been adequately resolved. It's very difficult to resolve in any kind of empirical way.  </p><p>But increasingly there is evidence that maybe they're thinking globally, and you see that in some of the China Russia security cooperation that's gone global, not just in Asia, but in the Arctic and additional cooperation that takes on allies of Japan and South Korea. You see that in some of their (INAUDIBLE) global institutions. You see that in the discourse of the party on global governance, which is now the number one funded topic within the think tank system within China. It used to be maritime affairs. Now it's global governance.  </p><p>So there's all this circumstantial evidence suggesting that they're seeing things in a more global light. We should look additionally for what they do in the financial space. Are they going to seek to actually build parallel financial systems or undermine the U.S. dollar, etc.? </p><p>Finally, last point very quickly, how much of this is about President Xi? So in our past batch of papers we answered this kind of very question, all of us independently, all of us coming to the same kind of conclusion. My personal view, and it's a strong view, and it's a contested view, is that if President Hu Jintao had a third term a lot of what we're seeing now would still continue because it's not all about President Xi. I think of it as a lot of it rooted in the--in actually the party and its own vision of how global order should be arranged, how the regional system should be arranged, what national rejuvenation looks like, all of which has certain degrees of continuity. And I'm happy to talk more about why I think that as we go on. Thanks. </p><p>CHHABRA: So Cheng, this is a great entree into your paper, so you have said that in your paper that there's a--put it this way. There is a debate, as Rush just described, about Xi's impact on foreign policy, but there's a broader debate also about his standing within the Chinese Communist Party. Soon the one hand he's clearly consolidated his power, giving himself lifetime tenure, writing himself into the Constitution. As you point out in your paper, appointing supporters at the national and provincial levels of leadership, building a new populace brand and then focusing on both poverty alleviation and the development of megacities.  </p><p>But then on the other side of this debate you also have analysts like Richard McGregor who focus on the backlash to Xi's rules. So help us better understand this debate, including, you know, whether there are ways in which both elements of this debate could be correct. </p><p>LI:  Well, Richard is a good friend of mine, and he is a very respected scholar on Chinese (INAUDIBLE) politics, wrote the fascinating book, you know, a while ago called The Party. His new book (INAUDIBLE) talk about The Backlash. I haven't looked at the new book, but I read his article in Foreign Affairs.  </p><p>Now I think it's fair to say I think Richard would probably agree with me that no one could (INAUDIBLE), and the thing is not so much of black and white. You know, it's a little bit of complicated--Rush may not like the word complicated. And I think that we should avoid this kind of black-and-white to certain extent because based on different perspective.  </p><p>The title of my article I borrowed E.E. Cummings', the term called the proregress. It's a combination of progress and regress. Actually I got this word when I visited a Shanghai art exhibition called Shanghai Biennale, which was last year. </p><p>I also was in that museum just a few weeks ago. They used the title that is pro-regress to describe the art scene and also the ever-changing world. And also interestingly there is an equivalent Chinese term which was actually hardly used in Chinese language is the term called (UNTRANSLATED). It is based on the (INAUDIBLE) Asian--(INAUDIBLE) is mysterious kind of dance, a dancer that seems like they are moving forward but simultaneously moving backward and vice versa.  </p><p>Now I think it is very important on different people's perspective we look at the different assessments about Xi Jinping. Now this is also related with a Harvard professor Robert Putnam(SP) he wrote about two decades ago so-called to levels of chess games. You know sometimes politicians, the state leaders playing the game simultaneously domestic chess and international chess and does not make sense that if you look at the one chessboard it makes perfect sense, you look at the two chess boards, so that is dynamic we should look at that.  </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) Xi Jinping after continuation with too much talk about he just completely change the Chinese (INAUDIBLE) trajectories which is not true I think it is a continuation he is backed to a certain extent by the entire leadership (INAUDIBLE) top leadership. And finally I think it is very, very important to understand that Xi Jinping is also constantly adjusting environment. It's the action-reaction process; for example that he has been early on in his first term he was kind of a conservative (INAUDIBLE) toward the market except (INAUDIBLE) talk about the market and reform, but after that (INAUDIBLE) job but recently (INAUDIBLE) shifted back.  </p><p>It started from last November six points policy to promote the private sector, but of course he would continue to emphasize these state role in these so-called the state capitalism, etc. Now all of these things tell us that it's not just a simple true or false, right or wrong of course some facts but it's important to keep that we should also look into (INAUDIBLE) perspective beyond ourselves and be also aware there are a lot of dynamic things going on so this is my take about (INAUDIBLE) argument. </p><p>So for intellectuals in China certain backlash. For some international communities also a backlash but not necessarily for Africa, Latin America, the Middle East some of the people see (INAUDIBLE) road is really an opportunity to promote their development. So again different perspective, different assessment so it should not be a surprise for us, but I think very, very important for our policymakers to appreciate that kind of different layers and simultaneously you see progress and regress in the case of Xi Jinping and to a certain extent in the case of China. </p><p>CHHABRA: So, Cheng, if we--you do talk though about Xi Jinping's populist brand and so if we could just play out a little bit concrete ways thinking about some of the tensions in the U.S.-China relationship right now the trade war, reaction to the protest in Hong Kong, the detention of Uighurs in (INAUDIBLE) and now reports that some of this treatment of Muslims in China may extend to other populations in (INAUDIBLE) Northwest China for example, too. How--how does this new brand of populism play itself out? What--what are the implications? </p><p>LI:  Certainly, these are real challenges, real problems. I don't want to you know underestimate these challenges. Trade war (INAUDIBLE) first time hit Chinese middle class and as the country has a surplus usually where we get more and especially China still put a lot of emphasis on exports. </p><p>Now but the interesting thing is Xi Jinping made some adjustment here in addition to what I said about promote private sector development but also he played a card of EU and the UK and Japan. There are a lot of economic development going on in that region and also China probably (INAUDIBLE) U.S. power would stop the listing of Chinese companies, but China is already prepared you look at their so-called assigned (INAUDIBLE) it is like science and the technology stock market list them in Shanghai very quickly approve. </p><p>So these are all of the preparation to use the trade war so that gives Xi Jinping some leverage probably most importantly I certainly spend a lot of time in my article talk about also the contradictory move on the one hand Xi Jinping is a populist poverty elimination, not poverty reduction poverty elimination is the promise which is also a continuation with other leadership because it started with (INAUDIBLE) then (INAUDIBLE) and (INAUDIBLE) but Xi Jinping is lucky enough in the point to announce that by next year China will eliminate it; he also use more policy (INAUDIBLE) mechanism to implement that used the new term position poverty elimination really to announce that hopefully the next year he can announce that this is making him very popular with the poor people. </p><p>But now he reach the middle class in the major cities Shanghai, Beijing and (INAUDIBLE) and also (INAUDIBLE) area and also (INAUDIBLE). So if these places actually previously three, six years--three, four years ago almost enough of these leaders, top leaders, party secretary and governor or mayors Xi Jinping (INAUDIBLE) but now the majority of them are Xi Jinping's protege(SP) so if they are well-positioned to carry out this kind of delivery so this trade front. </p><p>Now regard (INAUDIBLE) maybe also I think we are very much interested in what's going on in Hong Kong these are big challenge but the nationalism on the rise for example just to talk about Hong Kong I think the Chinese leader may not be as anxious as many of us here to believe because for Chinese leadership why they should be too nervous.  </p><p>Yes, it is an embarrassment, but now it sounds like they get used to that because they certainly demonized the protesters, students and blamed the United States, UK, the West behind this kind of protest. It is not my view, but that is most of the people in China certainly feel that there is some evidence for that and also (INAUDIBLE) incompetence it is not Beijing's incompetence but rather some of the policymakers or--or leaders in Hong Kong and finally they also blame the business tycoons these people (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>So the pressure for Beijing is very, very low if we look at these kind of things going on. Of course I don't want to see that happening, but it has already happen I think that they have the leverage whether right or wrong. At the moment I do not think these kind of things will spread to China because Xi Jinping is backed by populism nationalism and there's early on mention about the national parade.  </p><p>Certainly you can see there's a tremendous discussion in China talk about China; this is China's global power of the United States wants to put China down. That interpretation that you find more and more people believe previously intellectuals especially pro-U.S. intellectuals certainly cynical, the majority of them probably still cynical but you see the switch some people now persuaded that some people in the United States want to put China down so at this time they want to back Xi Jinping, back the leadership. So that is the situation we enter. This is the way to answer your excellent question about the (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CHHABRA: So I think we will have everyone will probably want to weigh in on some of Hong Kong and (INAUDIBLE) as well. But Jamie, I want to turn to you and the work that you have done on China's legal development. </p><p>So I think most China specialist generally are aware that the parties sits atop the state in China but the story you tell in your contribution to our series is that under President Xi the party control is being consolidated and institutionalized in a fairly unprecedented way through law and you argue that this in some dimension is a legitimizing project for the party but you also worn on the other hand that the party's heightened involvement in state governance without corresponding legal accountability and its continued resort to exceptional extralegal measures to deal with perceived enemies may undermine the stability of expectations of trust at home and abroad that the party needs to succeed. So--so tell us why are we seeing this move now and why are we seeing it under President Xi? </p><p>HORSLEY: Thank you very much for the question and restating my thesis for me. So I guess to start off with first is the continuity piece which everybody has been talking about.  </p><p>So there is a lot of continuity under Xi Jinping in the legal area. Primarily when Xi Jinping came in one of his very first priorities was to elevate what he calls for rule of law with socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and ruling the country in accordance with the law or law-based governance and so we sort of elevated the legal project to a higher position; it's one of his four comprehensive. He devoted a whole Plenum to it as well and in fact what we have seen under Xi is a continuation of (INAUDIBLE) push to modernize the legal system that would deliver rules-based solutions in the majority of cases to both promote economic development and maintain social stability. </p><p>On the other hand what is new and what I see as short of a shift under Xi Jinping is an effort to then also legalize the status of the party. So the party is not registered under law. Some people argue it always has had constitutional basis because the parties mentioned in the preamble of the state constitution which discusses you know the history of the PRC, etc. But for most of the PRC history the party has not been mentioned specifically in the main body of the Constitution, and this was one of the constitutional amendments that happened in March 2018 when they removed the term limits and also set up a new branch of government, the supervision commission to take on anticorruption responsibilities. They wrote the party into the Constitution, the party's role in leadership to constitutionalize it.  </p><p>In addition there's been a push to write the party and its leadership role into more law and nationally applicable regulation. So prior to Xi's term, the party was mentioned in something called the legislation law from 2000. In 2005 actually they amended a company law to require that all companies private, foreign-invested and state-owned have to establish and support party organizations. So that was already written into the company law. But under Xi, the party has begun to be written into of course all--the whole suite of national security-related laws that they have come out within Xi's first-term but also in state counsel regulations as well.  </p><p>So it sort of raises the question why is the party, why do they feel they need to do this. The parties leadership as you note and all of us know has always been asserted over everything, but under Xi he has made a big point of asserting and making very explicit the party leadership over everything including law and legal institutions. But again as--as Rush was talking about and Cheng as well there's the words, and then there's the reality in the practice. </p><p>What I have also seen and so in my area I've begun to sort of watch this, I followed you know the state-society interactions, etc. and I have begun to see again party writing itself into for example procedures for rulemaking. So we always knew the party controls legislation, and they control the (INAUDIBLE) People's Congress, they controlled the state counsel, but again they felt it important now to write this actually into state law and make it very explicit. </p><p>And beyond this they have been asserting or institutionalizing their role in state governance in a whole variety of other ways and I go into excruciating detail in this paper but it has to do with jointly issuing regulations with the state, the merger that happened just after the March 2018 National People's Congress of several state entities into party entities. The--the epitome of all of this is, of course, the establishment of this supervision commission which was given constitutional status as a branch of government, given its own organic law but in fact, is just the state face of the party's discipline inspection commission.  </p><p>So you have a lot of these more now merged parties, state bodies, dual-facing but increasingly taking on state governance activities and why is this concerning? As you point out it is because the party even though they are trying to legalize their position they are not accountable under law. So for example if the party jointly issues a regulation with the state council, if it's a state council regulation they have to go through notice and comment procedures; you know the regulations are made public, people can go to court and sue to enforce them. If it's a party regulation on the -- that applies, so the party then removes the state functions outside the purview of the law such as it is. So that is one shift that I have seen is this push. </p><p>Now at a broader level it sort of reflects, and the argument has been made that Xi does recognize and appreciate the legitimating power of law and that is why he has elevated--the party has elevating law as a cornerstone of their new governance strategy. We understand the fourth plenum coming up is going to be devoted to discussing modernization of the party's governing capability and governance capacity. </p><p>Now another thing though that is still disturbing how do you square this importance of law in the legal system with the sword of the extra-legal treatment that we see the party doling out to perceived enemies of the regime? So and this was interesting to me to just focus on the fact that there's been a persistence of (INAUDIBLE) concept of two contradictions. So you have non-antagonistic contradictions among the people, this is a very natural and complex society. These contradictions can and should be handled in accordance with law.  </p><p>But then you have contradictions between the people and the enemy and those contradictions which threaten the stability of the party-state those that are handled outside through extrajudicial and often extra-legal coercive methods as well and that is another concerning aspect of the party's move because this indicates a kind of conditional attitude toward law. If you are deemed to be among the people, and it's a normal contradiction then the normal legal system which is increasingly professional, autonomous, rules-based, etc. that kicks in. But if you are perceived to be an enemy then you are outside of that system, and all of this, of course, is implications for China's role in the world and dealing with actors both you know foreign companies operating in China but also China's activities overseas.  </p><p>It's not--again look at the words, they are concerning and I was trying to identify why does this party legalization project make me feel uncomfortable and--and I've tried to articulate it is partly because it removes it from the area of state governance and kind of undermines, in fact, the whole legitimation through legalization project that the party seems to be carrying on now. But again it is important to see how it plays out in practice as well and I totally endorse what colleagues have said here today that when you are looking at China making policy yes, we must take the party at its word but then go beyond it and see how is this actually playing out in practice and try and analyze how in each situation this may impact us and our interests. </p><p>CHHABRA: So take--just to take one example of how this (INAUDIBLE) play out in practice Huawei has been in the news quite a bit. One of the arguments that has been made--that have been made is China actually does have some data protection laws right, that may complicate efforts to secure data from Huawei's service for example. But your argument would seem to suggest that as the party essentially begins to eat state law and to think about it in one way those claims would seem to become more and more hollow. Would you agree with that or would you think about it in a different way? </p><p>HORSLEY: Well, again it's a complicated situation, so I think the Huawei case is pretty special. It's got a military background, etc., etc. and it is everywhere in the world now, so there's a great deal of interest and concern about it. To back up again looking at the facts on the ground it was very interesting to me to see that the party is still doing a fairly light-handed approach to the private sector.  </p><p>You know as Cheng mentioned now again they have realized as economy slows China really needs the private sector. They are the main source of GDP growth, of job creation, of innovation and we have heard stories for example that you know the party-state has to negotiate with the big tech companies to get access to their data. You know how much, how often, in what form, etc. which is very similar to say Uber negotiating with New York City before it went in in terms of what data they would have to turn over to the state as well.  </p><p>And if you look at the party regulations and policies they do treat the private companies different from say a state-owned enterprise. So for example in the state-owned enterprises there were a lot of news reports a couple of years ago about this new requirement that the party have to write the party's committees role into the as so we the corporate charter or the Association and they were applying this also to the joint ventures between SOEs and foreign companies as well so that was raising a lot of concerns about what exactly is the role of the party.  </p><p>I mean traditionally they have always had a requirement whenever there's three or more party members in an entity whether it's a law firm or a company or an NGO you must--the party members must form a party organization, but now they are taking this requirement and trying to legalize it and make it a legal requirement either as matter of law or in this case the party--I mean the corporate charter. They haven't imposed the same requirement on private companies and their--although of course we know there's a big push for all of the companies to set up you know party organizations a much smaller percentage of private companies apparently do, etc.  </p><p>So clearly the party knows they are trying to while they really want to be able to control them and get access to data and other--and their innovations and they also don't want the private sector to be competing with the party-state they know they can't kill the golden goose and so you see a very interesting dance going on here. </p><p>When it comes to national security though I think this--this suite of national security laws I mentioned which include counterintelligence and national security and the data of cybersecurity, law, etc. where they have written the party into it the national security card could trump it, but even in that case I think the party-state would be careful on how they deploy it. Just like our government is even though in their case you couldn't go to court to--to prevent the party from access there, too. So it is a very complicated answer to your question. It is a complicated situation. </p><p>CHHABRA: Audrye, let's come to you. So you contributed a paper to the series earlier this year it all who wrote a book about China's economic statecraft and you are making the case that in some places China is focused on subversion which you find as going around established political processes and institutions and in other cases you see them engaged in what you call stakeholder cultivation where they are going through those institutions and processes. </p><p>So tell us why do you see different tactics in different places and how is this playing out through China's Belt and Road initiative? </p><p>WONG: Sure. So I think in terms of economic statecraft China has, by and large, used the strategy of what I call subversive carrots(PH), (INAUDIBLE) investment projects tend to circumvent regulatory procedures, institutional  approval procedures often involves the use of corruption. </p><p>And I think in terms of the Belt and Road this has generated a significant amount of public and political backlash. We see political incumbents losing office in countries that are important strategically important for China and the BRI so Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, incoming politicians of lost office because they have accepted corrupt infrastructure loans from China. And this is important because it means that we are seeing resistance to China's Belt and Road initiative across a range of developing countries even those with perhaps imperfect democratic processes.  </p><p>And this backlash has also produced a demonstration effect in which we are seeing elites and public and different countries becoming more skeptical and wary of accepting Chinese investments, Chinese financing and think--and being more wary about Chinese intentions and so this overall has created a bad reputation for the Belt and Road initiative in the last couple of years. And this means that the China has been not been broadly successful in its you know purported geopolitical intentions of having a very ambitious goal of trying to buy over--buy political influence using economic tools. </p><p>At the same time China is also learning and in my conversations in China my interlocutors have--have acknowledged some mistakes that Chinese made and the need for better public diplomacy, cooperation, adherence to institutional standards and processes, respecting regulations in receiving countries and we see this learning rhetorically as well as in practice.  </p><p>So in terms of rhetoric we see a rebranding of the Belt and Road initiative. China in recent years has--has tried to--has announced plans to curb corruption, implement better monitoring of overseas investment projects and second Belt and Road forum in April this year Chinese leaders also went beyond the usual bland rhetoric of win-win cooperation to really emphasizing the importance of debt sustainability, cracking down corruption, improving transparency and working with other developed countries and multilateral institutions and investment financing, infrastructure development. </p><p>And in practice in the context of certain bilateral relationships we see the Chinese government Chinese actors also being pressured to adjust its strategy. In Malaysia, for example, we have seen there was huge controversy over the East Coast rail link where we were away project was being suspended under the newly elected government after elections last year. China underwent a renegotiation process where the same railroad project is now moving forward with improved terms from Malaysia, at a reduced scale and cost and something that makes more sense for Malaysia's economy as well. </p><p>And in the example is Myanmar where again the government renegotiated a (INAUDIBLE) contract with the help of the US State Department and leaders have also publicly stated the importance of having BRI and Chinese investment be able to win over the support of the local people and local populations. </p><p>And what are the implications perhaps for--for how U.S. and other countries should think about China's Belt and Road initiative I think first China hasn't been as effective at buying political influence. I have seen a lot of skepticism about BRI on increased wariness and so in terms if you are thinking about BRI as part of China's grand strategy to increase its prominence and popularity and gain goodwill around the world that hasn't really succeeded as--as of now. </p><p>And so for the U.S., I think it is really important to think about economic statecraft as--as a component of grand strategy not just in terms of how China is operating but also how the U.S. should respond. I think in the international order today we have seen increasing prominence of economic and nonmilitary tools on this efforts to geopolitical competition efforts to gain political influence. So we need a more comprehensive and strategic way of thinking about integrating and national security and economic bureaucracies and thinking of this--thinking about security (INAUDIBLE) of economic activity. </p><p>CHHABRA: So tell us a little bit more what would that comprehensive approach look like and Rush, you have written a little bit about how the United States should respond to the Belt and Road as well so perhaps you could join in as well. </p><p>WONG: Sure. Well I think U.S. by and large in terms of national security strategy and thinking has--has by--has tended to favor--think about military options I think that's a very important tool but I think there needs to be a better coordination across on different bureaucracies the United States government. </p><p>So thinking about for example the U.S. State Department is organized by geographic regions but I think if we want to think about understanding China's Belt and Road initiative and its efforts at  economic statecraft globally we need to kind of overcome these bureaucratic silos and really integrate our approach and looking at China's strategy in different regions of the world at the same time. So maybe Rush-- </p><p>DOSHI: Sure. So let me just say a few things about Belt and Road very quickly. This is a great example of continuity I think in China's strategy, and I say that because although the Belt and Road was announced by President Xi Jinping there was a 2009 speech by President (INAUDIBLE) which was a major speech in which he adjusted the strategic guidelines that determined Chinese grand strategy and in that speech he proposed an interoperable network of infrastructure that would crisscross Asia and basically tie countries to China.  </p><p>That is in his speech in 2009 many years before the Belt and Road was announced and of course that, in turn, was preceded by China's going out initiative which was an effort to make sure that China was able to make its SOEs more competitive internationally, to secure resources, to invest in infrastructure, etc. So there is a longer-term history to some of these efforts that was only formally institutionalized and elevated under President Xi. </p><p>So why do I mention that? I mention that because that means that this is something that is not completely about branding, it's not completely random, it's not completely about vested interest. There is a larger rationale that has been there for a long time, but it was explicitly described in political terms in key party documents. So when people say that the Belt and Road is an example of failed Chinese grand strategy or the Belt and Road is incoherence and backlash is a sign that China is facing challenges, I say two things.  </p><p>One, well, they don't see it that way. They see it as something that they have been trying to do for a long time and second, I would argue that there is a belief in China but also outside of China that the Belt and Road is actually quite resilient. So we have heard a lot about backlash throughout the region, right? Sri Lanka, Malaysia, etc.  </p><p>Take Sri Lanka, the case where China had to turn over a port to (INAUDIBLE) or Sri Lanka had to turn over a port to China, essentially the (INAUDIBLE) port. Sri Lanka went back this past January for a $1 billion loan from China for highway construction. Audrye mentioned really well some of the cases where China was adaptable in Malaysia for example, in Myanmar where renegotiated terms. </p><p>In Nepal that's another case where there was one political group that was opposed to some infrastructure projects; another group won, they went back, restarted those projects and built a new and sort of pushed for a new rail line that will connect Nepal to China. So there's a lot of examples I think of where it is sort of the resilience of the Belt and Road is really on display and the reason I mention that for U.S. policy is that because the Belt and Road is more resilient than we thought it's not going to be enough to simply just wait for it to collapse under its own weight. So the U.S. has to provide alternatives, that is something that the United States is doing with the BUILT Act helps lead that, OPEC is a part of that. Other countries are also interested in cooperating with the United States. That is part one. </p><p>DOSHI: But part two, and this goes again to what Audrye was talking about is making sure that people are aware of the problems that Belt and Road has with respect to governance. So there are extensive examples of some of these SOE's from China being involved in corruption at the local level extensive well-documented examples all the way from Latin America and Ecuador, which might have implicated several senior leaders all the way to Pakistan, parts of Africa where vice president's children in some countries were getting payoffs to Sri Lanka where there were payoffs to direct families and on and on it goes.  </p><p>When that information comes out, as Audrye mentioned, it can shape the politics of those countries. The question is will it come out. So there is an informational component to combating the belt and road, which I think is asymmetrical. And finally, we shouldn't, and I actually misspoke. I shouldn't say combating the belt and road, because the belt and road isn't a bad thing. Lots of it can be good. All this infrastructure is needed. But it should be done in ways that are consistent with standards for governance and consistent with strategic maneuverability for those countries so they don't feel completely indebted. And those kinds of tweaks to the program are going to require a U.S. alternative and a better informational strategy. </p><p>CHHABRA: Cheng and Jamie. </p><p>LI:  Well, I'll just add a few things based on what my colleague just said. We do need to ask whether China as a regional power, and increasing global power has its own legitimate national interest to develop a Belt and Road Initiative, number one. </p><p>Number two, is that pre-determining on the Chinese leadership part, particularly choosing pings part tried to use that belt and road to undermine or challenge or kick U.S. out of Asia, you know, Asia region. Is that the predetermined as a kind of evil plan? Certainly, I'm cynical about that. </p><p>But of course, possible if our policy continued to contain China, it will be like this. But ultimately, it depends on how we look at the international system and worldview. And finally, whether China could improve belt and road because of the inaudible challenges. My answer is yes, and you can continue. So I think these are the three things I just add to the very valuable discussion by my colleagues. </p><p>CHHABRA: Jamie and then I know Rush wants to come back in. </p><p>HORSLEY: Right, so I'll just yet, from a legal point of view, I studied--everybody studied belt and road. It's sort of like the full employment initiative for the world these days. But I look at it from the legal and governance point of view and a couple of things. One, the problems they run into initially too, I don't think it's because China had this planned to go out there and subvert established procedures and, you know, engage in corruption, et cetera. It's a very messy noninstitutionalized project, and a lot of what the pressure on China now is to try and impose more institutionalization on it. And at that Belt And Road Forum in April, there was an intent to start talking about having a clean BRI as well as a green BRI.  </p><p>Transparency is a huge issue. From the point of view of American companies and engineering consultants and even our lawyers, you know, they would like to see an open procurement system put in place. There's a lot of pressure. We could partner with the EU, which is also putting pressure on China to open up the procurement on all levels as well. So I think in addition to having counter strategies, which we should, we ought to find ways to support and cooperate, sometimes often with our other allies, but also directly with China on making the belt and wrote really be a much better initiative. </p><p>DOSHI: Yeah, I'll just jump back in by saying the Belt and Road isn't always a bad thing and there are definitely ways in which you can be leveraged to do good things for the rest of the region. And that's especially important. But the belt and road is also not one thing, it's many different projects and the (INAUDIBLE) of analysis is not the overall program, it's the specific projects. And if you look at some of the specific projects, many of them long perceived the announcement of the Belt and Road. </p><p>And if you look at those projects, some of them, including the ones in Sri Lanka and the ones in Myanmar and the ones in, you know, Bangladesh and the ones in Pakistan are about a particular kind of strategy. That is a belief that certain ports have a lot of value. That belief is not unite uniquely Chinese. Every power that's ever aspired to the Indian Ocean influence dating back to the Portuguese, 500 years ago has recognized those same places matter. And of course, they're places where you find extensive Chinese investment. And don't take my word for it, take the head of the state oceanic administration who read--who wrote in a paper and then said and a speech, so that's twice, that he thought that those ports could be useful access opportunities for the People's Liberation Army. That's an official source.  </p><p>President Xi Jinping has talked about the militarization and securitization of the Belt and road, so there is a discourse out there that sees this as a good thing for Asia, and there's a lot of good. It's a public good. (INAUDIBLE) talk about the Belt and Road as a public good. We should take them at their work on a lot of those projects. But some of the projects, not the roads in Sri Lanka, but the ports in other places, some of those projects have clear, strategic rationale. So it's important for us to not paint with too broad a brush stroke. </p><p>And I'll just finish by saying Xi Jinping also talks about belt and road in terms of brush strokes. And what he says is that in the first phase of the project, he's now announce the second phase, right, and that didn't happen, by the way, at the Belt and Road Forum. </p><p>That second phase was announced the year before the Belt and Road Forum in the fifth anniversary of the Belt and Road in 2018. In in that speech he says time for phase 2. What was phase 2 going to be? Will he said in phase 1 we focused on the big brushstrokes, big projects, big things. Phase 2 would be smaller. And as Jamie mentioned greener, leaner. It would be cleaner. It would also be more likely to directly benefit individuals and easier to talk about in ways that was less controversial.  </p><p>Because, to Jamie's point, a lot of the problems with belt and road aren't always about nefarious Chinese plan, many of them are just endemic to the nature of doing development financing abroad. Now, some of them are also endemic to the nature of Chinese political economy, which is a different. So both those things have to be taken into account. But the point there is the belt and road is changing. It's adaptable. And many--much of it is good, but we have to focus on those areas where it poses as significant strategic challenge. </p><p>CHHABRA: Before we go to Audrye, how much should we be concerned about the convergence of the export of surveillance technology and belt and road? So for example, and David Dollar (SP) mentions this in his paper, that there's a project in Zimbabwe focused on facial recognition. So how much of these are going to be intertwined, do you think? </p><p>DOSHI: Well, I think that there is a big component of the Belt and Road let's talk about as the sword of the digital belt and road, right, the sort of silicon component to it. I don't know that China has explicitly, deliberately exporting its system. I don't--I don't quite buy that. I don't think it has a reason to do that. I'm not sure there are a lot of buyers for. It's really hard to pull off. I think the way that this works is more implicit and I think, Tarun, you've sort of written about some of this as well, so I should plug our moderator's caper on this subject, which suggests that some of the ways in which the--this kind of dissemination of China's system will take place will be through channels that are not always evangelical, right? </p><p>So they could be, well, Huawei wants to sell-- Huawei is actually involved in helping one country sensor it's--it's Internet. Right? So that's--that's something that's useful for that country, but it's not because China wants to make the world more liberal, it's just because there's a commercial opportunity there.  </p><p>There are other ways in which, you know, we've seen China export surveillance technology or facial recognition technology to Zimbabwe, but that's really hard to pull off. It's going to take a long time before they're able to get there. But I think it's important to watch this space because this is one of the key questions. Will the rise of China to true global superpower status, peer competitor of the United States mean that liberal values are going to be attenuated or they will persist? And the question is not knowable right now. It's something were going to see and maybe, to my colleague Cheng Li's point, something we can shape with good cooperative policy. </p><p>CHHABRA: Audrye. </p><p>WONG: Sure. Just to add on a couple of points that I completely agree BRI is a messy project. It's--it's--you know, involved a broad range of actors in multiple, competing interests. And I think that has--but because I think for a lot of audiences outside of China they see, you know, Chinese firms and SOE's acting as agents that our Chinese state, to--whether that is whether completely true or not, I think this is feeding the way that China is offering inducements often corrupt ways often has fed into a negative perceptions opportunities and tensions and what China--China is trying to achieve and the potential effects that China could have on domestic and political processes in these recipient countries.  </p><p>And going--feeding on the points about U.S. providing alternatives, I think that's absolutely important working with allies, partners, multilateral institutions to provide alternative sources to financing because it's not credible for the United States to criticize you know, developing countries or receiving countries in belt and road to say you can't take, you know, Chinese money without--that's not credible if you're not providing alternatives.  </p><p>And I think--but at the same time, I think it's hard for, you know, completely peer competition in Chinese and Chinese financing just because of the ability of the Chinese state to Marshall resources. And so, you know, there are also cost-effective I think ways of doing this. Not only working with allies and multilateral institutions, but also promoting reform (INAUDIBLE) processes of approval within multilateral institutions. I think that would increase access to these alternative sources of financing.  </p><p>And also, one way is for the U.S. to share its technical expertise, know-how, resources, provide guidance to recipient countries so that they on the ground, both their elites in the government as well as public opinion are more aware of what's going on with the kinds of investments that China is offering and sort of--I think that's a cost-effective strategy of, you know, ensuring that and pushing China to ensure that it adheres to better transparency standards and government standards. </p><p>CHHABRA: Great to questions, thank you. So let's open it up with the audience Scarlett has the mic. Let's start here with this gentleman in the fourth row. Yeah, why don't we take both questions in the fourth row together. </p><p>QUESTION: I'm Peter Humphrey (SP), and Intel analyst and a former diplomat. I look at China's military buildup in particular and marvel at it because nobody is thinking about attacking China. And so the purpose of the military buildup is nothing more than supporting the Communist Party. And when--and when you look to China's grand strategy, I mean, isn't that really just making the world safe for autocracy because the more autocrats there are the better chances that the party can survive against Democratic pressures. </p><p>CHHABRA: And if you--our photographer just says if you wouldn't mind standing when you asked your questions so we could--we could capture you. </p><p>QUESTION: Mike Masonic (SP), PBS online news hour. In discussing grants grand strategy, how much of this is driven by internal dynamics versus an assessment of the vulnerabilities and strengths of other countries? In other words, do the Chinese look right now on what's going on in Washington as a short-term gift or part of a longer narrative of decline and withdrawal? And to what extent in the leadership is there a serious discussion, debate about the long-term strengths and weaknesses of countries like the United States? </p><p>CHHABRA: Two great questions about Chinese grand strategy. Do you want to start? </p><p>DOSHI: Sure, I'll start us off. So on the military question, I don't think that the purpose of China's military modernization over what I would say is the last 30 years has actually really been primarily about just the party itself. The first phase of military modernization--well, let's go back. 1980s China was actually thinking about building the kinds of platforms that would be important in winning a conflict with its neighbors in the South China Sea, for example. They were thinking a little bit more about aircraft carriers, actually, and there were some books which show in the mid-80s the force structure they were dreaming of having in the year 2000, and it didn't happen.  </p><p>And the reason it didn't happen was because of three years. 1989, 1990, 1991. '89,  Tiananmen Square. 1990, The Gulf War 1991, the full--the continued disillusion dissolution of the Soviet Union and its larger satellite states. And those three led them to think the United States was the primary adversary and that the method of war would be sort of based upon what they saw in the Gulf War. And so that meant not buying vulnerable platforms like surface vessels and in large quantities or aircraft carriers, but instead investing in asymmetric capabilities. Not because they wanted to take territory, but because they wanted to deny the ability of the United States to intervene in the region, and that gives rise to what we've now called anti-access area of denial approach that China has had.  </p><p>But many of those capabilities were, again, not useful for taking anything. They were useful for denying things. That changes. In the last 15 years, we've seen a shift away from that asymmetric strategy to what you could call is a more symmetric one about building and acquiring the very platforms that they once delayed, those aircraft carriers, those surface vessels, those amphibious platform vehicles, right? You know, LPD's, for example. That they want to use to be able to actually take in whole territory to be able to use an amphibious operations. That's a change, right?  </p><p>So that's a shift from defensive, you could think of a more defensive strategy to a more offense of one. Not because they want to conquer the world, but because they had equity as an important national interest close to home. That's hopefully an answer that's useful on the military side. On the grand strategy side, I think that question was really very useful. How much of China's grand strategy is externally driven versus internally driven? That is a key question.  </p><p>I happen to believe that a lot of Chinese grand strategy is externally driven, a lot of domestic behavior, a lot of domestic politics, etc. might be more domestically driven, but key strategic projects I think are more externally driven. And I say that for a few reasons. One is, and we talked about this, the party sits above the state, it penetrates every level of the state, and together, that means it has the ability to override some parochial interest. So for example, when, going back to the military case, the Navy and Leo Whoaching (SP) was very, very keen on aircraft carrier, he really wanted it, he had a lot of influence and clout, he was on the standing committee, but Jiyang (SP) him down time and time again because it wasn't the right time for China to be building an aircraft carrier so they didn't do it. That's an example of suppressing parochial interests to pursue a larger grand strategy.  </p><p>So the second reason--people talk about public opinion and nationalism being a particularly powerful force in shaping strategy or constraining it. I'm partially skeptical because China retains the ability to arrest many of those nationalists when they are too out of line, and they've done it before in the past. So there's that--there's not that clear path that domestic politics can play. Divested interests don't necessarily work in--and public opinion doesn't.  </p><p>The last question was sort of about how much of it is shaped by the external factors? And here's where I'll make the case for what external factors I think matter. I think the primary factor that drives Chinese grand strategy is this its assessment of the United States because the United States is the biggest challenge to its core interest in the most important relationship for its economic development. It is the thousand pound gorilla. It has to pay attention to the United States. That's been true for a very long time.  </p><p>And the way that strategy changes, because strategy is tough to adjust, if I can oil tanker. It's hard to do a U-turn. But the way it does happen will not for an oil tanker but for strategy, anyway, so that's where the metaphor breaks down, is when there's a sharp discontinuous change in your perception of the United States. And where does that happen? 1989. We went from quasi allies during the Cold War to quasi adversaries. 2009, the financial crisis, we--China went from thinking the United States was extraordinary powerful to recognizing that it had certain weaknesses. And now potentially 2016 to 2018 where we see that the election of President Trump, Brexit, and the crisis of the West and Western democracies and liberalism suggest that, again, the U.S. is less threatening and maybe there's an opportunity for a more ambitious global agenda. A lot of this can be debated. None of this is air--air--bulletproof or airtight, but this is kind of how I see it right now. I'm also writing a book that makes the argument a bit more clearly. Thanks. </p><p>LI:  Well, I see these two questions are really linked together. For the military one, China now has money and they want to spend money in the military. And you look at China's map from that perspective, they concern a lot of fresh spots, you know, not only talk about the northern part of China, but also look at the coast, you know, from North Korea can Korean Peninsula, East China Sea, and South China Sea, and particularly the Taiwan issue. That's (INAUDIBLE). That's very much in Chinese visual mind.  </p><p>This goes to your excellent question about which part is more important. I would say their linked. But at the same time, I think a domestic concern, internal concern probably is a primary driver because without which the other one for top leadership is become irrelevant, right, because you do need to consult power for your very survival or success. It's largely determined whether you can defend the challenge of--challenge of natural interest. And any leader would be in big trouble if you see, you know, what--independence or China has been too soft with the United States.  </p><p>So that's, you know, the dynamics that we got involved. So of course, this is sometimes a certain issue areas is a different picture, but also that because of China become powerful, because China desperate need of foreign market and foreign resources that the military is also--is part of that process. And--but of course, this is also action--reaction dynamic spiral. Sometimes also we feel, our interests, our global power is weakened by that our United States China's challenge, especially China's military budget will increase dramatically in the coming years. So that's the--the period we enter. So many ways, it's very dangerous period that we enter. </p><p>CHHABRA: And just to come back to one last--the last part of the question is what is the debate look like about how to take advantage of this moment where in the United States we have a lot of domestic turmoil, there's a--there's a crisis of confidence and democratic capitalism, right, how would you describe that debate right now? </p><p>LI:  Well, let me--I think that's an excellent question. I think that our country probably will experience a lot of vicious in-fightings. And I--actually my expertise about Chinese (INAUDIBLE) politics (INAUDIBLE) politics, I do not see at the moment that this is a vicious power struggle going on, actually differ from many other rumors. I think under the pressure, China just has a tendency united together does not mean that they have disagreements, or they have different views, they have the potential, you know, of kind of a power aspiration. </p><p>But at the moment they were united together. So we enter this kind of full dynamic, so I think that as America, we do need to think about, you know, the challenge for us and Chinese nationalism on the rise in our nation, but also on the rise. But that can clash if our leadership is, you know, continued like (INAUDIBLE) kind of things. We entered election season, but China probably take advantage of this, will accelerate some of the programs. And so that will be to China's advantage. </p><p>DOSHI: Sure, I'll just jump in real quickly. I completely agree with everything that Cheng Li said and it's right--it's true the internal and the external dimensions are very linked and the key questions for whether or not China is able to accomplish its external objectives, the reason those are relevant is for internal political reasons. If you're a Chinese leader and you fail on Taiwan, the stakes are existential. Because of those stakes though, I see a disproportionate focus, on foreign policy on the United States. And I'll just--I'll just make it a little bit more tangible and concrete. We've all heard about the phrase hide capabilities and bide time. (UNTRANSLATED), right, this phrase. In many Chinese documents, that phrase is always tied to China's perception of what they call international balance of power or the (UNTRANSLATED). And that linkage is basically about United States, right, that's a textual linkage that you see. That doesn't mean that a Chinese leader is not thinking about internal politics and whether or not if they lose Taiwan, their rival will out-maneuver them. It just means that when they are thinking about external considerations, the United States is the primary--primary question, and that's the primary variable.  </p><p>And that links to deterrence question, which is how are they thinking about this moment when the West is struggling? And it's been the case there for 30 years, they've linked their grand strategy in a sense to perceptions of the United States. What does that mean right now? And I don't have a good answer. I don't have--I don't have compelling evidence one way or the other because we don't have all the documents. But what I have seen is a few things. One, a greater emphasis, I mentioned earlier, on global governance and think tanks. So that means greater funding for that as a policy priority of a leadership. That's something that people have talked a lot about within the Chinese system, and we're seeing more research along those lines.  </p><p>Second, we're probably--we are seeing interesting phrases in certain party documents. So Xi Jinping has used this one phrase a number of times, which is a once in a century opportunity, including in his discussion of belt and road. I haven't completely been able to unpack what creates that once in a century opportunity, but there is some indication among secondary commentary that it's really to the United States. And finally, the assessment of the international system in the 19th party of Congress reported, and in other documents, is a lot more positive for China, that there's a lot more instability in the balance of power and there's a lot more opportunity as well. And on global governance especially, we see far more references in those documents than we did under President Hu. So that's kind of interesting shift from President Hu. </p><p>CHHABRA: I think we have two more. There's this gentleman here and then here two, three rows back. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Tong Hoyu (SP) with China News Agency in Hong Kong. Several advanced weapons were displayed in today's Beijing military parade such as Donfeng-17, Donfeng-5B, and Donfeng-41. So what kinds of message would you like to from this kind of display for Mr. Rush and Mr. Cheng Li.  </p><p>CHHABRA: And this gentleman as well. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, distinguished panelists for coming here today. My name is Jim Rochelle (SP) from Policy Bot. We use data science and machine learning to analyze computational policy intelligence. So my question for you guys today is about how Brookings is analyzing global--or China's--how China is global influence is using their group to on the--on the digital platform to influence other countries. For example, the way in the liberal Western democracy how we use digital platform is now increasingly to disinform and to disorder how we think about how do we vote, but in the authoritarian countries like China, they're using censorship's on the digital platform to influence people, how people think.  </p><p>So quite recently, Doctor Howard Philip from the OII Oxford Institute--Internet Institute has published an article on how China is using digital means to influence the image of Hong Kong protests in the Western world. So for the first time, you have this propaganda--computational propaganda. So my question for the Brookings Institute researchers are how are you analyzing that at the moment? </p><p>CHHABRA: Do you want to go for this? </p><p>DOSHI: Okay, sure. Yeah, so on the military parade, I thought you were going to ask me which was my favorite Donfeng missile. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>I don't have a favorite. They're all just so hard to choose from, but-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>No, I understand. I remember the question very well. And on the--just making a small joke. On the message, I didn't think of it as that. Maybe this is contrarian perspective, but I wasn't particularly worried. I didn't think there was a strong message being sent. Military parades are not new in the P RC. Lots of countries have military parades. Granted, there were more missiles displayed on this parade than in the past. China also has more missiles now than it does--than it did in the past. So I--I didn't really think of the message--if the message was being sent, I don't think it was particularly concerning and I didn't view the parade with any undue concern.  </p><p>I thought it was fine if that's what they wanted to do and display the military technology. That's--that's fine. I'm much more concerned about what happens within region or what those capabilities do, but we already know that they exist, so the parade is irrelevant. The other question was about data. Under the--our China--some of our China work under Cheng Li is increasingly taking Chinese documents and digitizing them and putting them in a data set and sort of using that data set to do quantitative analysis. So some of the stuff that I've talked to you about today comes from the digitization of a mass quantity of party documents, and that I think is a useful approach to the attraction authoritarian questions. </p><p>LI:  Let me ask you, how many people watched that live broadcasting and the TV coverage about the parade? You can see, not many. So it's not symmetrical, the information. You know, I assume that in China so many people watched and to show China's muscle, China is coming off the interval military modernization. But in this country, first, we are not well-informed, but here it's not--this is not my point. My point is Dr. Henry Kissinger said that if we, United States and china, engage in a war, this is a war there would be no winner. We should not even consider this a fight if there is no winner.  </p><p>So I think that the assistant secretary early on in his keynote speech, he did talk about U.S.-China despite all this tension, we still need to cooperate with each other. We still need some real dialogue. It's very, very important. I think in modern warfare, you have no idea how this would be fought and in what time frame. It's even not like--certainly not like (INAUDIBLE). This is 2000 years ago. I mean, that where, you know, in Greece, Sparta, and Athens. But now we have economic (INAUDIBLE), we have a nuclear weapon and we have 5G, we have, you know, artificial intelligence. We have a lot of things unknown.  </p><p>I mean, so again, we've should avoid basically looking at 21st century world use like a 20th-century method, 19th century mindset. This is as someone said that I just quote (INAUDIBLE) but that's the fact. So again, it's not so much for military strengths, per se, but rather, we should find a way to prevent this kind of thing from happening. I understand why China want to show that at this critical moment from Chinese perspective, but I also see that from this audience, I mean, it's really very few people watch it. I mean, so that gave us a perspective.  </p><p>We do need to communicate much, much better through dialogue. So this also relates to the issues we haven't covered much. It's about the trade negotiations in the vice premier Liu He is coming to town in a matter of a few days. On the one hand, the trade issue is not as important as tech war as--as currency tensions and certainly as that security issues. But at the same time, United States and China should continue to engage economically. If we do not do that, there's not much left. So think about that kind of thing. So I perceived that way, so we do need to continue to promote cooperation with educational culture, economic, that's a must. Certainly we have a lot of tensions.  </p><p>Your question certainly raise that about different ideology, different political system and different message. Now, something it sounds like I'm protecting China, but actually, I'm quite critical about a lot of things going on in China in the media censorship and the legal system. In many ways there's a lot of says it cynicism within China, probably even stronger from outside world. And my friend Hu We Fong (SP), a leading scholar, a law professor, I actually published a book of him a few years ago. Now he's an (INAUDIBLE). But at the same time, we also, I mean, I did a research about Chinese legal profession particularly focusing on Shanghai because my book is about Shanghai. I looked at the top 10 private legal firms. I found that like half of these partners, actually more than half is top law firms wasn't educated.  </p><p>And they come from elite schools, Harvard, Columbia, Stamford, and Duke Law school, Berkeley, you name it. But also interestingly, 70%, 75% actually, I should say, those partners that actually got past New York bar exam. 75 of these western, American trained lawyers work in China. That provides you some hope at least in economic front that maybe eventually, you know, can spread. So that's the dynamic we should see. It's, again, it's a paradox on one hand the legal profession is not (INAUDIBLE), but at the same time, you see dynamic changes in society and even in the legal process. Also Xi Jinping himself is also contradiction. Actually, under his watch, he devoted one party plan (SP) on legal reform for but of course, there's some backlash, as Richard said, that particularly the term limits. So again, we should put it in that perspective. </p><p>CHHABRA: Audrye, I just wanted to, I don't know of you have a view on this, but on the social media question, a broader--more broadly on political influence, how much do you see efforts to kind of shape public opinion on Chinese--engagement with China economically as an element of China's statecraft. Is that something that you think we should expect to see more of? </p><p>WONG: Sure. I think especially with regard to the recent backlash, I think China has ramped up its public diplomacy efforts relating BRI and Chinese investment projects. I was in Malaysia this summer and people were telling me we see these videos of, you know, Malay and Malay women--the Malay lady and the Chinese lady singing together in Chinese and Malay, exhorting the benefits cooperation how, you know, good relations can be--bring women benefits to all parties. And so I think China is realizing, you know, that it really needs to work on that and improve its image. Whether that's going to be fully successful, I think, will have to go hand in hand with how China actually, in practice, conducts its investment. </p><p>CHHABRA: Good. And to the point about what Brookings is doing, I think you'll see more about this in the forthcoming set of papers on East Asia where there will be discussions in the context of Hong Kong and Taiwan as well. Let's take two final questions. Yes. One here. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. I'm sure we both heard the phrase let a thousand flowers bloom, and that phrase comes to mind as I listen to you this afternoon. The question I have is to what extent is Chinese culture embedded in the design and implementation of economic statecraft and what would be those aspects of culture that we could identify as specifically affecting how these policy initiatives emerge? </p><p>CHHABRA: Great. And one final question in the back corner. Yeah, in the very back. Yes. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for your time. You mentioned a lot about the grand strategy. I wanted to ask specifically about the economic grand strategy. As we see, China made--made in China 2025 and things like that are creating a lot of decoupling between the U.S. and China in economic terms. I think Doctor Li touched a bit on this, but one of the main reasons why we say U.S. and China would not have a conflict is because of the economic benefits that we both gain. So as we see more decoupling happening, what are some of the main things that we can do to bring U.S. and China together, especially when there's a lot of amplifying on issues like South China Sea and other things that bring a lot of tensions?  </p><p>CHHABRA: All right, culture and decoupling. We have two minutes. Why don't we start with Cheng and then back down the row?  </p><p>LI:  As I observed, Chinese leadership at the at least the national level no longer use the term made in China 2025. They realized that it's really kind of embarrassment if you want to stay industrialists, China occupies 70%, 80%, 90%, how let the rest of the world to, you know, to business? So that's the realization make China be sensitive in this area but does not mean that China will abandon the--the industrial policies and et cetera, but a little bit open the room for the broader strategic or cooperation in other areas. The kind of spill over.  </p><p>So with that things going on, I think that we will see some opportunity for American company, you know, have market access, intellectual property rights, and if early on, my, you know, views about the legal profession is real, I think we probably should a little bit have a little more patient. Built ultimately, these kind of Western trained but many probably will play important role in the legal development with respect to law and economic front and later on beyond. So this is the dynamic. That's why I think the core economic Corporation should continue at this critical moment. </p><p>Now the culture things, I don't want to comment to much because for so long, particularly in the first 30 years for PRC that Chinese economy not really doing well. So let's tells you it's not just about culture. Sometimes political system, government policy, and entrepreneurship and et cetera. I mean, all important, especially when trying to open up, then you really see the--later on you see the economic miracles. So it's not the--it's relatively speaking less to do with culture. So I would not emphasize too much on that regard. </p><p>HORSLEY: So I'll just say I worried about law too in talking about cooperation and keeping the doors open. So China still looks to the U.S. also as one of the primary grounds of experience and law when they're thinking about reforming the legal system. People don't realize because of the reporting what the judicial reforms that have gone on under Xi Jinping for example. In the areas I work in, open government, they adopted notice and comment rulemaking from basically us as well as ideas of transparency. They have a freedom of information act, which again, they sent people here to study and have continued to look at our experience with it too.  </p><p>Xi Jinping speaks against Western-style, constitutionalism, you know, judicial independence, et cetera, but he wants everybody to continue to learn the beneficial experience from the West. And it is still true they look primarily to the U.S. because we still have the most dynamic economy and they look to our negative experience as well as a positive one. And so I also have seen the normal legal system continue to progress both in terms of substantive laws, you know, anti-domestic violence, the sexual harassment has begun to be explored now, even though politically it's still sensitive in China. A whole range of issues, mental health, et cetera. They continue to look at us as well as, you know, Europe and other countries too.  </p><p>And so I would hope not just the Western trained lawyers, but many levels. The judges, the prosecutors, the police--we brought police from China. The public security people to meet with counterparts at seminars in Florida, for example, discuss, you know, how do you handle domestic violence issues, et cetera? I mean, all of this kind of exchange continues today, and I would hope it doesn't cease. You know, with this talk of coupling decoupling is very concerning on many, many levels. But certainly in the legal area as well, even though there are a lot of contradictions in China and--and there are a lot of things that we care about and are very concerned about, there's still a lot of progress and development going on. It's not a finished story yet. </p><p>DOSHI: Sure. And I just want to echo both those points. And I completely agree. It would be--it would be a real shame if we saw less interaction, less people to people exchange, less student exchange, and especially less exchange in legal areas between the United States and China as competition intensifies. Those should really be protected. It's in the American interest for them to be protected, it's in Chinese interest. Just to give a concrete example, we have a colleague, Jamie and I have a colleague who works on some of the issues relating--we've had people from China who work on issues related to gender discrimination and law. And there's a lot of interest at high levels in the party on getting that issue right and they're looking at the United States. So there are areas where we can actually cooperate and advance values that we have in China.  </p><p>On the made in China 2025 question, I never thought it--to the issue it was important, but I also always thought it got more attention than it deserved because, again, so much of what was happening in that initiative happened way before that. I mean, tech transfer through investment vehicles, through theft, through cyber espionage, through student sometimes, all of that is long-standing. That's not new. And a lot of that was state directed in the past and it continues to be in the present. That was a particularly poor branding choice by China because it sort of gave a coherent target for all of it. But as Chung Lee mentioned, it's no longer visible. Macro polo think tank has done a quantitative analysis showing that it's disappeared from messaging in China official publications et cetera. It's just gone, which tells you that they kind of realized they messed up. It's not out there.  </p><p>But the point you raised about decoupling in those areas remains very serious and I think that would be a shame in some capacity, in some ways, but it's also inevitable when one state is not necessarily playing as fairly, I think, in IP. On the cultural point, I very much agree with my colleagues. I'm not an expert on the cultural--on the implications of culture for economics. I focus more on the institutions or any of--I think institutions matter a lot more, so I just didn't want to get too far into it. But others, hopefully, can give you more information. There is a rich discourse on how you can quantify certain aspects of the culture they can be useful. </p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>DOSHI: Yeah, maybe. Maybe, ma'am. </p><p>CHHABRA: To you, Audrey. </p><p>WONG: Sure. Very quickly, I definitely echo my colleagues sentiments on the dangers of decoupling and importance of continuing economic--promoting economic cooperation and interdependence. I think, you know, efforts to weaponize independence on the part of the United States through the trade war or other means is actually going to sell it to divergence between the United States and the trajectory of the two economies in the two--and the two political systems. Culture, I don't--I don't work on culture specifically. I mean, if you think about economic statecraft, this is not a culture argument by any means, but I think, like, in the way that China has conducted its overseas economic activities does reflect to a certain extent, as Rush mentioned earlier, about its domestic political economy and the nature of state, state and market relations and state and state business relations and Chinese elites proclivity to use government to government relations as opposed to working with private--private actors and civil society. This is a reflection of the political system and institutions and it's not--it's not on culture, this argument, but I guess we could see some trends in how China is conducting its economic statecraft. </p><p>CHHABRA: Great. One final plug is in addition to reading the papers, please also look out for podcast series that's hosted by our colleague Lindsay Ford every day.

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) \u2013 ranking member of the U.S Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \u2013 delivered the following opening statement at today\u2019s hearing entitled \u201cThe Digitization of Money and Payments.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Brown\u2019s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Big Tech companies have made a lot of big promises about the better society they were going to allow us to build.</p><p>And they have not lived up to them.</p><p>They sold us the idea the technology they\u2019d unleashed would help us level the playing field for people whose voices have been silenced, they insisted it would democratize industries, and they promised it could build a more just and equal country.</p><p>Instead, like so many corporations before them, they just created new ways to pay themselves, at the expense of everyone else.</p><p>They\u2019ve disrupted industries and institutions \u2013 from taxi cabs to local journalism to our democracy itself. Instead of building something better, they tear things down for their own profit.</p><p>And as usual, it\u2019s workers \u2013 especially low-wage workers and Black and brown workers, mostly women \u2013 getting exploited.</p><p>As we all know, essential workers clean our hospitals, feed our families, drive our public transportation, deliver our packages, and so much else that we take for granted.</p><p>And these essential workers are the ones most likely to get sick when people don\u2019t wear masks \u2014we continue to see that, as cases spike again.</p><p>Newsflash \u2013 four months into a pandemic, four months after public health officials said we should wear masks, the Secretary of HHS says he agrees. Even the Vice President is wearing a mask, and Leader McConnell is saying we should wear masks.</p><p>Finally, most people in high places, at least, are wearing masks.</p><p>Essential workers are largely women, often people of color, and they\u2019ve been taken advantage of by corporations for decades \u2013 they aren\u2019t paid a living wage, they don\u2019t have control over their schedules, they don\u2019t have good benefits or safety protections on the job, and they\u2019re usually sabotaged if they try to organize a union.</p><p>Big Tech has just made it easier for corporations to exploit them.</p><p>Tech companies give other corporations new tools to mine people\u2019s data, to target them with ads for predatory lending. They created facial recognition technology and sold it to law enforcement, to better target protestors. Their app-based business models have made it even more efficient to turn thousands of workers into, quote, \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d with no job security or workplace protections.</p><p>Facebook even created a new tool called \u201cFacebook Workplace\u201d to let corporations censor and spy on workers trying to organize unions. They\u2019ve backed off for now, and of course they claim that\u2019s not what it was intended for \u2013 but it was right there in their marketing materials, selling other corporate executives on a tool that would allow them to blacklist the word \u201cunionize.\u201d</p><p>So given that history, why on earth would we trust Big Tech with our banking system?</p><p>We do need some disruption in the banking system.</p><p>As many working families in this country know, it is expensive to be poor. You have to pay to cash the check from a hard weeks\u2019 work. You have to move money around at just the right time and in just the right way. You have to pay a transfer fee pocketed by your bank. You make one misstep, you get smacked with a late fee that could have covered food or diapers. And if you need to borrow a little money because your pay day doesn\u2019t line up with the due dates on your bills? Be prepared to pay loan-shark rates.</p><p>For rich people with money in the bank, the bank pays you. For everyone else, you pay the bank.</p><p>Many essential workers also interact with the economy mostly in cash. Since the pandemic, it\u2019s only gotten harder and more dangerous, as people try to use digital platforms to pay for as much as possible, to reduce contact and exposure to the virus.</p><p>These are problems we need to tackle \u2013 but I\u2019m skeptical financial technology firms will solve them. Given these companies\u2019 record, it seems more likely they\u2019ll only make the problems worse.</p><p>Yes, these fintech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their \u201cinnovation.\u201d</p><p>But even with all the fintech hype over the last decade, it\u2019s hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have actually helped the people they say it will.</p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they\u2019re really just payday lenders with a website or an app.</p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would fundamentally change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, or buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that\u2019s not what happened\u2014Bitcoin is primarily used by wealthy investors.</p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee \u201cinnovative\u201d products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That\u2019s simply not true \u2013 the algorithms use biased data, and we end up with more discrimination against the very people they say their products will help.</p><p>And let\u2019s not forget that many of these companies have argued that they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve.</p><p>The people who really benefit are always the same \u2013 the CEOs and their wealthy investors.</p><p>For corporations, the U.S banking system is a public good.</p><p>The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars commerce every year.</p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone.</p><p>That\u2019s why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country \u2013 or go online \u2013 and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve and hooked directly into the Federal Reserve\u2019s payment systems.</p><p>Banking for All means no more check cashing fees. No more paying to use the money you already earned. No more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.</p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they\u2019re essential to.</p><p>And it means if you\u2019re lucky enough to have some savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do.</p><p>Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies and full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. And it doesn\u2019t require us to gut financial protections to make this solution work.</p><p>This is an opportunity to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, and to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans of the banking system.</p><p>Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3479095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6089-0181-JDG9-Y4B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs delivered the following opening statement at today's hearing entitled \"The Digitization of Money and Payments.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Brown's remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech companies have made a lot of big promises about the better society they were going to allow us to build.</p><p>And they have not lived up to them.</p><p>They sold us the idea the technology they'd unleashed would help us level the playing field for people whose voices have been silenced, they insisted it would democratize industries, and they promised it could build a more just and equal country.</p><p>Instead, like so many corporations before them, they just created new ways to pay themselves, at the expense of everyone else.</p><p>They've disrupted industries and institutions from taxi cabs to local journalism to our democracy itself. Instead of building something better, they tear things down for their own profit.</p><p>And as usual, it's workers especially low-wage workers and Black and brown workers, mostly women getting exploited.</p><p>As we all know, essential workers clean our hospitals, feed our families, drive our public transportation, deliver our packages, and so much else that we take for granted.</p><p>And these essential workers are the ones most likely to get sick when people don't wear masks we continue to see that, as cases spike again.</p><p>Newsflash four months into a pandemic, four months after public health officials said we should wear masks, the Secretary of HHS says he agrees. Even the Vice President is wearing a mask, and Leader McConnell is saying we should wear masks.</p><p>Finally, most people in high places, at least, are wearing masks.</p><p>Essential workers are largely women, often people of color, and they've been taken advantage of by corporations for decades they aren't paid a living wage, they don't have control over their schedules, they don't have good benefits or safety protections on the job, and they're usually sabotaged if they try to organize a union.</p><p>Big Tech has just made it easier for corporations to exploit them.</p><p>Tech companies give other corporations new tools to mine people's data, to target them with ads for predatory lending. They created facial recognition technology and sold it to law enforcement, to better target protestors. Their app-based business models have made it even more efficient to turn thousands of workers into, quote, \"independent contractors,\" with no job security or workplace protections.</p><p>Facebook even created a new tool called \"Facebook Workplace\" to let corporations censor and spy on workers trying to organize unions. They've backed off for now, and of course they claim that's not what it was intended for but it was right there in their marketing materials, selling other corporate executives on a tool that would allow them to blacklist the word \"unionize.\"</p><p>So given that history, why on earth would we trust Big Tech with our banking system?</p><p>We do need some disruption in the banking system.</p><p>As many working families in this country know, it is expensive to be poor. You have to pay to cash the check from a hard weeks' work. You have to move money around at just the right time and in just the right way. You have to pay a transfer fee pocketed by your bank. You make one misstep, you get smacked with a late fee that could have covered food or diapers. And if you need to borrow a little money because your pay day doesn't line up with the due dates on your bills? Be prepared to pay loan-shark rates.</p><p>For rich people with money in the bank, the bank pays you. For everyone else, you pay the bank.</p><p>Many essential workers also interact with the economy mostly in cash. Since the pandemic, it's only gotten harder and more dangerous, as people try to use digital platforms to pay for as much as possible, to reduce contact and exposure to the virus.</p><p>These are problems we need to tackle but I'm skeptical financial technology firms will solve them. Given these companies' record, it seems more likely they'll only make the problems worse.</p><p>Yes, these fintech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their \"innovation.\"</p><p>But even with all the fintech hype over the last decade, it's hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have actually helped the people they say it will.</p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they're really just payday lenders with a website or an app.</p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would fundamentally change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, or buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that's not what happenedBitcoin is primarily used by wealthy investors.</p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee \"innovative\" products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That's simply not true the algorithms use biased data, and we end up with more discrimination against the very people they say their products will help.</p><p>And let's not forget that many of these companies have argued that they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve.</p><p>The people who really benefit are always the same the CEOs and their wealthy investors.</p><p>For corporations, the U.S. banking system is a public good.</p><p>The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars commerce every year.</p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone.</p><p>That's why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country or go online and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve and hooked directly into the Federal Reserve's payment systems.</p><p>Banking for All means no more check cashing fees. No more paying to use the money you already earned. No more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.</p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they're essential to.</p><p>And it means if you're lucky enough to have some savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do.</p><p>Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies and full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. And it doesn't require us to gut financial protections to make this solution work.</p><p>This is an opportunity to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, and to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans of the banking system.</p><p>Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123792346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6082-8341-JCBF-S3YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) - ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs - delivered the following opening statement at today's hearing entitled \"The Digitization of Money and Payments.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Brown's remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech companies have made a lot of big promises about the better society they were going to allow us to build.</p><p>And they have not lived up to them.</p><p>They sold us the idea the technology they'd unleashed would help us level the playing field for people whose voices have been silenced, they insisted it would democratize industries, and they promised it could build a more just and equal country.</p><p>Instead, like so many corporations before them, they just created new ways to pay themselves, at the expense of everyone else.</p><p>They've disrupted industries and institutions - from taxi cabs to local journalism to our democracy itself. Instead of building something better, they tear things down for their own profit.</p><p>And as usual, it's workers - especially low-wage workers and Black and brown workers, mostly women - getting exploited.</p><p>As we all know, essential workers clean our hospitals, feed our families, drive our public transportation, deliver our packages, and so much else that we take for granted.</p><p>And these essential workers are the ones most likely to get sick when people don't wear masks --we continue to see that, as cases spike again.</p><p>Newsflash - four months into a pandemic, four months after public health officials said we should wear masks, the Secretary of HHS says he agrees. Even the Vice President is wearing a mask, and Leader McConnell is saying we should wear masks.</p><p>Finally, most people in high places, at least, are wearing masks.</p><p>Essential workers are largely women, often people of color, and they've been taken advantage of by corporations for decades - they aren't paid a living wage, they don't have control over their schedules, they don't have good benefits or safety protections on the job, and they're usually sabotaged if they try to organize a union.</p><p>Big Tech has just made it easier for corporations to exploit them.</p><p>Tech companies give other corporations new tools to mine people's data, to target them with ads for predatory lending. They created facial recognition technology and sold it to law enforcement, to better target protestors. Their app-based business models have made it even more efficient to turn thousands of workers into, quote, \"independent contractors,\" with no job security or workplace protections.</p><p>Facebook even created a new tool called \"Facebook Workplace\" to let corporations censor and spy on workers trying to organize unions. They've backed off for now, and of course they claim that's not what it was intended for - but it was right there in their marketing materials, selling other corporate executives on a tool that would allow them to blacklist the word \"unionize.\"</p><p>So given that history, why on earth would we trust Big Tech with our banking system?</p><p>We do need some disruption in the banking system.</p><p>As many working families in this country know, it is expensive to be poor. You have to pay to cash the check from a hard weeks' work. You have to move money around at just the right time and in just the right way. You have to pay a transfer fee pocketed by your bank. You make one misstep, you get smacked with a late fee that could have covered food or diapers. And if you need to borrow a little money because your pay day doesn't line up with the due dates on your bills? Be prepared to pay loan-shark rates.</p><p>For rich people with money in the bank, the bank pays you. For everyone else, you pay the bank.</p><p>Many essential workers also interact with the economy mostly in cash. Since the pandemic, it's only gotten harder and more dangerous, as people try to use digital platforms to pay for as much as possible, to reduce contact and exposure to the virus.</p><p>These are problems we need to tackle - but I'm skeptical financial technology firms will solve them. Given these companies' record, it seems more likely they'll only make the problems worse.</p><p>Yes, these fintech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their \"innovation.\"</p><p>But even with all the fintech hype over the last decade, it's hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have actually helped the people they say it will.</p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they're really just payday lenders with a website or an app.</p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would fundamentally change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, or buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that's not what happened--Bitcoin is primarily used by wealthy investors.</p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee \"innovative\" products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That's simply not true - the algorithms use biased data, and we end up with more discrimination against the very people they say their products will help.</p><p>And let's not forget that many of these companies have argued that they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve.</p><p>The people who really benefit are always the same - the CEOs and their wealthy investors.</p><p>For corporations, the U.S. banking system is a public good.</p><p>The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars commerce every year.</p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone.</p><p>That's why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country - or go online - and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve and hooked directly into the Federal Reserve's payment systems.</p><p>Banking for All means no more check cashing fees. No more paying to use the money you already earned. No more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.</p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they're essential to.</p><p>And it means if you're lucky enough to have some savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do.</p><p>Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies and full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. And it doesn't require us to gut financial protections to make this solution work.</p><p>This is an opportunity to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, and to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans of the banking system.</p><p>Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/brown-calls-for-a-more-equitable-banking-system\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/brown-calls-for-a-more-equitable-banking-system</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSP63000201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6083-WGY1-JCCP-00RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Given these companies' record, it seems more likely they'll only make the problems worse.</p><p>Yes, these fintech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their \"innovation.\"</p><p>But even with all the fintech hype over the last decade, it's hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have actually helped the people they say it will.</p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they're really just payday lenders with a website or an app.</p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would fundamentally change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, or buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that's not what happened--Bitcoin is primarily used by wealthy investors.</p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee \"innovative\" products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That's simply not true - the algorithms use biased data, and we end up with more discrimination against the very people they say their products will help.</p><p>And let's not forget that many of these companies have argued that they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve.</p><p>The people who really benefit are always the same - the CEOs and their wealthy investors.</p><p>For corporations, the U.S. banking system is a public good.</p><p>The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars commerce every year.</p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone.</p><p>That's why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country - or go online - and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve and hooked directly into the Federal Reserve's payment systems.</p><p>Banking for All means no more check cashing fees. No more paying to use the money you already earned. No more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.</p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they're essential to.</p><p>And it means if you're lucky enough to have some savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do.</p><p>Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies and full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. And it doesn't require us to gut financial protections to make this solution work.</p><p>This is an opportunity to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, and to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans of the banking system.</p><p>Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-calls-for-a-more-equitable-banking-system\">https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-calls-for-a-more-equitable-banking-system</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSM630007G4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6083-WGY1-JCCP-00G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) \u2013 ranking member of the U.S Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \u2013 delivered the following opening statement at today\u2019s Executive Session.</p><p>Sen. Brown\u2019s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I would like to thank Chairman Crapo for scheduling this markup and advancing the Committee\u2019s nominees.</p><p>As I stated last week, leadership matters. Since then, almost 20,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, sending the total to nearly 160,000. This Administration has abandoned its duty to the American people with tragic consequences.</p><p>The three nominees we are considering today must show the leadership the president has lacked, and commit to working for a financial system that protects working families, instead of taking advantage of them. Their job is to put the people we serve first \u2013 not only during this time of financial and economic stress, but all the time.</p><p>If Commissioner Peirce and Ms. Crenshaw are confirmed, the public will trust them to always keep in mind whose side they are on, and to understand how hard Americans are working to save and invest for retirement, to send their kids to college, or to buy a home. We want our markets to be fair and available to everyone, but that doesn\u2019t mean rolling back important safeguards. As Commissioners, if they don\u2019t put those families first, who will? Not Wall Street banks, we know that.</p><p>I will support the SEC nominees, but call on them to stay grounded in the struggles workers and families face and to put those families first.</p><p>Mr. Hauptman has been nominated to serve as a member of the NCUA Board, but I am concerned about Mr. Hauptman\u2019s experience and qualifications to be one of the top regulators of credit unions in this country.</p><p>If confirmed, Mr. Hauptman would oversee over 5,000 credit unions that serve 121 million members. They are often community-based institutions, serving customers that banks and other financial institutions leave behind, like middle-income and low-income workers, women, and Black and brown communities.</p><p>His testimony and answers to questions at the hearing and for the record do not provide any details on what types of policies he will advocate for to actually help the credit union members he would serve. He says technology can help people who have been left behind by our banking system, but has failed to provide any examples of how that should be accomplished.</p><p>Instead of laying out specific ideas to help credit unions and their members, Mr. Hauptman praises Netflix as an example of the benefits of innovation \u2013 calling it the ultimate solution to Blockbuster\u2019s late fees and market dominance. I wonder if he\u2019s aware of reports of a toxic work culture at Netflix, or if he just doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>And Big Tech companies dominate the market in a way that Blockbuster could never dream of, driving smaller companies out of business and amassing huge amounts of personal data, exploiting our privacy and our civil rights for financial gain. He fails to recognize that \u201cinnovation\u201d is often just a shiny new way to exploit workers and target consumers with the same predatory products and services.</p><p>If his previous work and positions are any indication, he will be another advocate for rolling back important financial safeguards \u2013 another voice for the powerful and the privileged, who have more than their share of influence already.</p><p>We need public servants who will actually serve the public, especially now. If confirmed, I expect all of the nominees to make sure this public health crisis doesn\u2019t turn into a financial crisis. It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure we have a fair financial system that works for everyone.</p><p>Thank you, Chairman Crapo.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3604925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J1-0DK1-JDG9-Y176-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N522130MM</classCode><className>CREDIT UNIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A4KY</classCode><className>LOW INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N813930MM</classCode><className>LABOR UNIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A498</classCode><className>MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N522130MM</classCode><className>CREDIT UNIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N522120FD</classCode><className>FRIENDLY &amp; PROVIDENT SOCIETIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009US4</classCode><className>SHERROD BROWN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) - ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs - delivered the following opening statement at today's Executive Session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Brown's remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I would like to thank Chairman Crapo for scheduling this markup and advancing the Committee's nominees.</p><p>As I stated last week, leadership matters. Since then, almost 20,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, sending the total to nearly 160,000. This Administration has abandoned its duty to the American people with tragic consequences.</p><p>The three nominees we are considering today must show the leadership the president has lacked, and commit to working for a financial system that protects working families, instead of taking advantage of them. Their job is to put the people we serve first - not only during this time of financial and economic stress, but all the time.</p><p>If Commissioner Peirce and Ms. Crenshaw are confirmed, the public will trust them to always keep in mind whose side they are on, and to understand how hard Americans are working to save and invest for retirement, to send their kids to college, or to buy a home. We want our markets to be fair and available to everyone, but that doesn't mean rolling back important safeguards. As Commissioners, if they don't put those families first, who will? Not Wall Street banks, we know that.</p><p>I will support the SEC nominees, but call on them to stay grounded in the struggles workers and families face and to put those families first.</p><p>Mr. Hauptman has been nominated to serve as a member of the NCUA Board, but I am concerned about Mr. Hauptman's experience and qualifications to be one of the top regulators of credit unions in this country.</p><p>If confirmed, Mr. Hauptman would oversee over 5,000 credit unions that serve 121 million members. They are often community-based institutions, serving customers that banks and other financial institutions leave behind, like middle-income and low-income workers, women, and Black and brown communities.</p><p>His testimony and answers to questions at the hearing and for the record do not provide any details on what types of policies he will advocate for to actually help the credit union members he would serve. He says technology can help people who have been left behind by our banking system, but has failed to provide any examples of how that should be accomplished.</p><p>Instead of laying out specific ideas to help credit unions and their members, Mr. Hauptman praises Netflix as an example of the benefits of innovation - calling it the ultimate solution to Blockbuster's late fees and market dominance. I wonder if he's aware of reports of a toxic work culture at Netflix, or if he just doesn't care.</p><p>And Big Tech companies dominate the market in a way that Blockbuster could never dream of, driving smaller companies out of business and amassing huge amounts of personal data, exploiting our privacy and our civil rights for financial gain. He fails to recognize that \"innovation\" is often just a shiny new way to exploit workers and target consumers with the same predatory products and services.</p><p>If his previous work and positions are any indication, he will be another advocate for rolling back important financial safeguards - another voice for the powerful and the privileged, who have more than their share of influence already.</p><p>We need public servants who will actually serve the public, especially now. If confirmed, I expect all of the nominees to make sure this public health crisis doesn't turn into a financial crisis. It's your responsibility to make sure we have a fair financial system that works for everyone.</p><p>Thank you, Chairman Crapo.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-opening-banking-committee-executive-session\">https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-opening-banking-committee-executive-session</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSM805088E6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HT-GCP1-JCCP-03XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) \u2013 ranking member of the U.S Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \u2013 delivered the following opening statement at today\u2019s hearing entitled \u2018Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain.\u2019</p><p>Sen. Brown\u2019s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Thank you Chairman Crapo, and welcome to our witnesses.</p><p>At this committee\u2019s hearing earlier this month, many of us of both parties voiced serious concerns about Facebook\u2019s plan to run its own currency out of a Swiss bank account.</p><p>And by and large, we mostly heard deflections and dodging. It\u2019s exactly what we mean when we say Facebook doesn\u2019t understand accountability.</p><p>Facebook has proven over and over, through scandal after scandal, that it can\u2019t be trusted.</p><p>But they don\u2019t care.</p><p>They move fast and break things \u2013 things like our political discourse, journalism, relationships, privacy. Now they want to break our currency and payment systems, hiding behind the phrase \u201cinnovation.\u201d</p><p>They want to \u201cinnovate\u201d Americans right out of their hard-earned paychecks.</p><p>Look around at what happens with big corporations say they want to \u201cinnovate.\u201d</p><p>Before they blew up the economy in 2008, bankers were pitching an \u201cinnovative\u201d new product called subprime mortgages.</p><p>Just like Facebook \u2013 which claims its new currency will help the unbanked and underbanked \u2013 these mortgages were supposed to help people who never had access to credit achieve the American dream of homeownership.</p><p>In reality, those mortgages ripped off millions of families who ended up losing their homes, they wrecked the economy, and they made the staggering inequality in this country even worse.</p><p>The only innovative thing about the financial crisis was how the banks managed to stick everyone else with the bill \u2013 not exactly the kind of innovation we were hoping for.</p><p>So I am all for innovation \u2013 especially if that innovation delivers on its promises of improving people\u2019s lives. But big tech companies and Wall Street banks are hiding behind innovation as an excuse to take over important public services that we all benefit from, and should all have a say in.</p><p>There are some things \u2013 like our currency, our payments system, and the protection of our savings accounts \u2013 that everyone in the country has a stake in. We should not be handing those kinds of public resources over to wealthy special interests, so they can squeeze more profits out of ordinary Americans.</p><p>Think about how hard it is to get quality service from Comcast, or about how much of your personal data was leaked by Equifax, or how your privacy was invaded by Facebook. And, we just learned in the last 24 hours, Capital One. Who\u2019s next? We don\u2019t know.</p><p>So we should be a little suspicious when someone tells us that only big corporations can be trusted to provide critical public services.</p><p>I recently moved into a new office \u2013 it was John Glenn\u2019s office when he served Ohio in the Senate. I moved there because he and Annie are longtime friends. We\u2019ve known each other for 30 years. John Glenn spoke at my Eagle Scout dinner in Mansfield, Ohio 50 years ago. But I moved into that office primarily because he was an innovator \u2013 he was the first American to orbit the Earth as part of the Mercury Project, which would be followed by the Gemini and Apollo Missions that would eventually put Americans on the moon. Many of us joined in the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo 11 just this month.</p><p>None of the astronauts did it alone \u2013 it took the hard work of thousands of innovating scientists and engineers, people like famed mathematician Katherine Johnson or immigrants like engineer Miguel Hernandez. These Americans didn\u2019t do it for the profits. They did it to serve their country, and their successes were shared by every American who saw \u201cU-S-A\u201d emblazoned on the side of Apollo 11.</p><p>It\u2019s a reminder that some infrastructure works better as a public good, and we shouldn\u2019t let Big Banks or Big Tech get their hands on it.</p><p>The Federal Reserve and other watchdogs need to continue to be leaders in banking innovation.</p><p>And if we don\u2019t move quickly to improve important infrastructure \u2013 not just roads and bridges, and highways and water sewer systems, but our payments systems, too. If we don\u2019t move quickly to improve it, we\u2019ll end up with big corporations that have broken our trust again and again and again, and frankly I don\u2019t think that makes any sense.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about which of these technologies might actually help regular Americans.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2253726I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPM-MF21-JDG9-Y2Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's exactly what we mean when we say Facebook doesn't understand accountability.</p><p>Facebook has proven over and over, through scandal after scandal, that it can't be trusted.</p><p>But they don't care.</p><p>They move fast and break things things like our political discourse, journalism, relationships, privacy. Now they want to break our currency and payment systems, hiding behind the phrase \"innovation.\"</p><p>They want to \"innovate\" Americans right out of their hard-earned paychecks.</p><p>Look around at what happens with big corporations say they want to \"innovate.\"</p><p>Before they blew up the economy in 2008, bankers were pitching an \"innovative\" new product called subprime mortgages.</p><p>Just like Facebook which claims its new currency will help the unbanked and underbanked these mortgages were supposed to help people who never had access to credit achieve the American dream of homeownership.</p><p>In reality, those mortgages ripped off millions of families who ended up losing their homes, they wrecked the economy, and they made the staggering inequality in this country even worse.</p><p>The only innovative thing about the financial crisis was how the banks managed to stick everyone else with the bill not exactly the kind of innovation we were hoping for.</p><p>So I am all for innovation especially if that innovation delivers on its promises of improving people's lives. But big tech companies and Wall Street banks are hiding behind innovation as an excuse to take over important public services that we all benefit from, and should all have a say in.</p><p>There are some things like our currency, our payments system, and the protection of our savings accounts that everyone in the country has a stake in. We should not be handing those kinds of public resources over to wealthy special interests, so they can squeeze more profits out of ordinary Americans.</p><p>Think about how hard it is to get quality service from Comcast, or about how much of your personal data was leaked by Equifax, or how your privacy was invaded by Facebook. And, we just learned in the last 24 hours, Capital One. Who's next? We don't know.</p><p>So we should be a little suspicious when someone tells us that only big corporations can be trusted to provide critical public services.</p><p>I recently moved into a new office it was John Glenn's office when he served Ohio in the Senate. I moved there because he and Annie are longtime friends. We've known each other for 30 years. John Glenn spoke at my Eagle Scout dinner in Mansfield, Ohio 50 years ago. But I moved into that office primarily because he was an innovator he was the first American to orbit the Earth as part of the Mercury Project, which would be followed by the Gemini and Apollo Missions that would eventually put Americans on the moon. Many of us joined in the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo 11 just this month.</p><p>None of the astronauts did it alone it took the hard work of thousands of innovating scientists and engineers, people like famed mathematician Katherine Johnson or immigrants like engineer Miguel Hernandez. These Americans didn't do it for the profits. They did it to serve their country, and their successes were shared by every American who saw \"U-S-A\" emblazoned on the side of Apollo 11.</p><p>It's a reminder that some infrastructure works better as a public good, and we shouldn't let Big Banks or Big Tech get their hands on it.</p><p>The Federal Reserve and other watchdogs need to continue to be leaders in banking innovation.</p><p>And if we don't move quickly to improve important infrastructure not just roads and bridges, and highways and water sewer systems, but our payments systems, too.

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) \u2013 ranking member of the U.S Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \u2013 delivered the following opening statement at today\u2019s hearing entitled \u201cThe Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\u201d.</p><p>Sen. Brown\u2019s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Mr. Chairman, welcome.</p><p>The stock market is soaring \u2013 but most American families get their money from a paycheck, not an account statement from their stock broker.</p><p>A critical part of your job is measuring and evaluating the economy, and those measurements need to take into account workers, not just wealth. Talk to workers who haven\u2019t had a meaningful raise in years, who have seen their retirement cut, who watch their health care premiums rise, who have seen the cost of child care and college and paying off their own student loans go up and up.</p><p>To those workers \u2013 to most Americans \u2013 the idea that a stock market rally means more money in their pockets is laughable.</p><p>As the Fed\u2019s own data reveals, the recovery hasn\u2019t helped most Americans\u2014corporate profits go up and up, but workers don\u2019t share in the growth they create. The top one percent have an average net worth of almost 24 million dollars, while the bottom half of all Americans have only about 20 thousand dollars. That\u2019s less than one one-thousandth of their wealthiest neighbors. Meanwhile the share of workers who have been unemployed for over 26 weeks continues to climb.</p><p>Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump responded by giving the wealthiest Americans and multinational corporations a two trillion dollar bonus. And those corporations turned around and funneled the money back to their executives through record stock buybacks.</p><p>We are in the midst of the longest economic expansion in modern times and interest rates are low, and yet it\u2019s worrying that interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy that provide good-paying jobs, like the auto industry, are not doing better. Employment in auto manufacturing \u2013 which is critical to Ohio \u2013 continued to fall in June.</p><p>The Fed\u2019s policies should ensure that everyone who contributes to our economy also shares in growth they create. All work has dignity, and we need an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.</p><p>Some of the challenges facing our economy can only be addressed by Congress. Millions of Americans struggle to pay for prescription drugs, which are increasing at five times the rate of inflation. And too many feel the squeeze of rising housing costs, with more than a quarter of renters spending over half their income on housing.</p><p>The Fed can\u2019t fix all of these issues on its own.</p><p>But there are things that you can and should do to help the economy work for the vast majority of Americans, through careful monetary policy and doing your job of policing Wall Street.</p><p>I appreciate your recent recognition that this expansion has the potential to benefit communities that have missed out on prior economic expansions. And I hope your comments expressing frustration that wages haven\u2019t increased as much as you expected means you will take action. I urge you to continue with policies that both lower unemployment while increasing wages.</p><p>In previous hearings, I have raised my concerns about threats to the financial system, including the Fed\u2019s steps to weaken the rules on the largest banks, the failure to activate the Countercyclical Capital Buffer to prepare for the next financial crisis, and the lack of action to address risks posed by leveraged lending. And just this week, Deutsche Bank announced a significant restructuring, overhauling several businesses and cutting 18,000 jobs\u2014almost 20% of its workforce. After several failed turnarounds in recent years, Deutsche Bank\u2019s latest effort shows it is too large and complex and has been mismanaged and under-regulated. And it isn\u2019t the only megabank in that situation.</p><p>I continue to be concerned that the Fed and other banking regulators are not doing enough. Today I can add a new worry to the list \u2013 private corporations, Facebook in this case, that have gotten carried away with their own power and are now attempting to ape the role of government, creating their own currencies, monetary policy, and payment systems.</p><p>So now, in addition to complex and risky Wall Street banks, we face new risks from unregulated, giant tech companies \u2013 armed with vast amounts of personal data \u2013 with the intent, as far as I can tell, of conducting monetary policy on their own terms.</p><p>You and I have a duty to serve the American people, but these private corporations have no duty to the broader economy or consumers. They\u2019re motivated by one thing: their own bottom lines. Allowing big tech companies to take over the payments system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake, and threatens to undermine our democracy.</p><p>Too many times, when the stock market is soaring and banks are making money hand over fist, regulators have been complacent. But as we have seen in the past, bank profitability is not a reliable indicator of a bank\u2019s true health, and the stock market is not a reliable indicator of the real economy\u2019s performance.</p><p>I hope this is not another example of the Fed taking a pass from its responsibilities to protect Americans from corporations taking big risks with our entire financial system. It is your responsibility to use your tools over monetary policy, the payment system, and prudential regulation to protect the financial system and make our economy work for all Americans, not just wealthy stockholders and huge corporations.</p><p>Thank you Chairman Powell for being here, and I look forward to hearing your testimony.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2181482I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-7DY1-JDG9-Y3VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sherrod Brown has issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) - ranking member o the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban A airs - delivered the ollowing opening statement at today's hearing entitled \"The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Brown's remarks, as prepared or delivery, ollow:</p><p>Mr. Chairman, welcome.</p><p>The stock market is soaring - but most American amilies get their money rom a paycheck, not an account statement rom their stock broker.</p><p>A critical part o your job is measuring and evaluating the economy, and those measurements need to take into account workers, not just wealth. Talk to workers who haven't had a meaning ul raise in years, who have seen their retirement cut, who watch their health care premiums rise, who have seen the cost o child care and college and paying o their own student loans go up and up.</p><p>To those workers - to most Americans - the idea that a stock market rally means more money in their pockets is laughable.</p><p>As the ed's own data reveals, the recovery hasn't helped most Americans-corporate pro its go up and up, but workers don't share in the growth they create. The top one percent have an average net worth o almost 24 million dollars, while the bottom hal o all Americans have only about 20 thousand dollars. That's less than one one-thousandth o their wealthiest neighbors. Meanwhile the share o workers who have been unemployed or over 26 weeks continues to climb.</p><p>Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump responded by giving the wealthiest Americans and multinational corporations a two trillion dollar bonus. And those corporations turned around and unneled the money back to their executives through record stock buybacks.</p><p>We are in the midst o the longest economic expansion in modern times and interest rates are low, and yet it's worrying that interest rate-sensitive sectors o the economy that provide good-paying jobs, like the auto industry, are not doing better. Employment in auto manu acturing - which is critical to Ohio - continued to all in June.</p><p>The ed's policies should ensure that everyone who contributes to our economy also shares in growth they create. All work has dignity, and we need an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.</p><p>Some o the challenges acing our economy can only be addressed by Congress. Millions o Americans struggle to pay or prescription drugs, which are increasing at ive times the rate o in lation. And too many eel the squeeze o rising housing costs, with more than a quarter o renters spending over hal their income on housing.</p><p>The ed can't ix all o these issues on its own.</p><p>But there are things that you can and should do to help the economy work or the vast majority o Americans, through care ul monetary policy and doing your job o policing Wall Street.</p><p>I appreciate your recent recognition that this expansion has the potential to bene it communities that have missed out on prior economic expansions. And I hope your comments expressing rustration that wages haven't increased as much as you expected means you will take action. I urge you to continue with policies that both lower unemployment while increasing wages.</p><p>In previous hearings, I have raised my concerns about threats to the inancial system, including the ed's steps to weaken the rules on the largest banks, the ailure to activate the Countercyclical Capital Bu er to prepare or the next inancial crisis, and the lack o action to address risks posed by leveraged lending. And just this week, Deutsche Bank announced a signi icant restructuring, overhauling several businesses and cutting 18,000 jobs-almost 20% o its work orce. A ter several ailed turnarounds in recent years, Deutsche Bank's latest e ort shows it is too large and complex and has been mismanaged and under-regulated. And it isn't the only megabank in that situation.</p><p>I continue to be concerned that the ed and other banking regulators are not doing enough. Today I can add a new worry to the list - private corporations, acebook in this case, that have gotten carried away with their own power and are now attempting to ape the role o government, creating their own currencies, monetary policy, and payment systems.</p><p>So now, in addition to complex and risky Wall Street banks, we ace new risks rom unregulated, giant tech companies - armed with vast amounts o personal data - with the intent, as ar as I can tell, o conducting monetary policy on their own terms.</p><p>You and I have a duty to serve the American people, but these private corporations have no duty to the broader economy or consumers. They're motivated by one thing: their own bottom lines. Allowing big tech companies to take over the payments system or position themselves to in luence monetary policy would be a huge mistake, and threatens to undermine our democracy.</p><p>Too many times, when the stock market is soaring and banks are making money hand over ist, regulators have been complacent. But as we have seen in the past, bank pro itability is not a reliable indicator o a bank's true health, and the stock market is not a reliable indicator o the real economy's per ormance.</p><p>I hope this is not another example o the ed taking a pass rom its responsibilities to protect Americans rom corporations taking big risks with our entire inancial system. It is your responsibility to use your tools over monetary policy, the payment system, and prudential regulation to protect the inancial system and make our economy work or all Americans, not just wealthy stockholders and huge corporations.</p><p>Thank you Chairman Powell or being here, and I look orward to hearing your testimony.

And I hope your comments expressing frustration that wages haven't increased as much as you expected means you will take action. I urge you to continue with policies that both lower unemployment while increasing wages.</p><p>In previous hearings, I have raised my concerns about threats to the financial system, including the Fed's steps to weaken the rules on the largest banks, the failure to activate the Countercyclical Capital Buffer to prepare for the next financial crisis, and the lack of action to address risks posed by leveraged lending. And just this week, Deutsche Bank announced a significant restructuring, overhauling several businesses and cutting 18,000 jobsalmost 20% of its workforce. After several failed turnarounds in recent years, Deutsche Bank's latest effort shows it is too large and complex and has been mismanaged and under-regulated. And it isn't the only megabank in that situation.</p><p>I continue to be concerned that the Fed and other banking regulators are not doing enough. Today I can add a new worry to the list private corporations, Facebook in this case, that have gotten carried away with their own power and are now attempting to ape the role of government, creating their own currencies, monetary policy, and payment systems.</p><p>So now, in addition to complex and risky Wall Street banks, we face new risks from unregulated, giant tech companies armed with vast amounts of personal data with the intent, as far as I can tell, of conducting monetary policy on their own terms.</p><p>You and I have a duty to serve the American people, but these private corporations have no duty to the broader economy or consumers. They're motivated by one thing: their own bottom lines. Allowing big tech companies to take over the payments system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake, and threatens to undermine our democracy.</p><p>Too many times, when the stock market is soaring and banks are making money hand over fist, regulators have been complacent. But as we have seen in the past, bank profitability is not a reliable indicator of a bank's true health, and the stock market is not a reliable indicator of the real economy's performance.</p><p>I hope this is not another example of the Fed taking a pass from its responsibilities to protect Americans from corporations taking big risks with our entire financial system. It is your responsibility to use your tools over monetary policy, the payment system, and prudential regulation to protect the financial system and make our economy work for all Americans, not just wealthy stockholders and huge corporations.</p><p>Thank you Chairman Powell for being here, and I look forward to hearing your testimony.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123059554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-3N51-DYTH-G1YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) - ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs - delivered the following opening statement at today's hearing entitled \"The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Brown's remarks, as prepared for delivery, follow:</p><p>Mr. Chairman, welcome.</p><p>The stock market is soaring - but most American families get their money from a paycheck, not an account statement from their stock broker.</p><p>A critical part of your job is measuring and evaluating the economy, and those measurements need to take into account workers, not just wealth. Talk to workers who haven't had a meaningful raise in years, who have seen their retirement cut, who watch their health care premiums rise, who have seen the cost of child care and college and paying off their own student loans go up and up.</p><p>To those workers - to most Americans - the idea that a stock market rally means more money in their pockets is laughable.</p><p>As the Fed's own data reveals, the recovery hasn't helped most Americans--corporate profits go up and up, but workers don't share in the growth they create. The top one percent have an average net worth of almost 24 million dollars, while the bottom half of all Americans have only about 20 thousand dollars. That's less than one one-thousandth of their wealthiest neighbors. Meanwhile the share of workers who have been unemployed for over 26 weeks continues to climb.</p><p>Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump responded by giving the wealthiest Americans and multinational corporations a two trillion dollar bonus. And those corporations turned around and funneled the money back to their executives through record stock buybacks.</p><p>We are in the midst of the longest economic expansion in modern times and interest rates are low, and yet it's worrying that interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy that provide good-paying jobs, like the auto industry, are not doing better. Employment in auto manufacturing - which is critical to Ohio - continued to fall in June.</p><p>The Fed's policies should ensure that everyone who contributes to our economy also shares in growth they create. All work has dignity, and we need an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.</p><p>Some of the challenges facing our economy can only be addressed by Congress. Millions of Americans struggle to pay for prescription drugs, which are increasing at five times the rate of inflation. And too many feel the squeeze of rising housing costs, with more than a quarter of renters spending over half their income on housing.</p><p>The Fed can't fix all of these issues on its own.</p><p>But there are things that you can and should do to help the economy work for the vast majority of Americans, through careful monetary policy and doing your job of policing Wall Street.</p><p>I appreciate your recent recognition that this expansion has the potential to benefit communities that have missed out on prior economic expansions. And I hope your comments expressing frustration that wages haven't increased as much as you expected means you will take action. I urge you to continue with policies that both lower unemployment while increasing wages.</p><p>In previous hearings, I have raised my concerns about threats to the financial system, including the Fed's steps to weaken the rules on the largest banks, the failure to activate the Countercyclical Capital Buffer to prepare for the next financial crisis, and the lack of action to address risks posed by leveraged lending. And just this week, Deutsche Bank announced a significant restructuring, overhauling several businesses and cutting 18,000 jobs--almost 20% of its workforce. After several failed turnarounds in recent years, Deutsche Bank's latest effort shows it is too large and complex and has been mismanaged and under-regulated. And it isn't the only megabank in that situation.</p><p>I continue to be concerned that the Fed and other banking regulators are not doing enough.

It is your responsibility to use your tools over monetary policy, the payment system, and prudential regulation to protect the financial system and make our economy work for all Americans, not just

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) \u2013 ranking member of the U.S Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today released a draft privacy bill, the Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020. Brown\u2019s proposal creates a new framework that would give Americans the power to hold corporations, big tech, and the government responsible for how they collect and protect personal data. The bill rejects the current, ineffective \u201cconsent\u201d model for privacy, and instead places strict limits on the collection, use, and sharing of Americans\u2019 personal data. The bill contains strong civil rights protections to ensure personal information is not used for discriminatory purposes, as well as a ban on the use of facial recognition technology. Brown\u2019s proposal also establishes a new independent agency dedicated to protecting Americans\u2019 privacy rights.</p><p>\u201cRight now, we do not protect people\u2019s privacy \u2013 that means we don\u2019t protect their civil rights. We need legislation now more than ever that empowers Americans to control their personal information. No person should have to worry about being spied on, just like no one should worry about their information being bought and sold or stolen,\u201d said Senator Brown. \u201cMy proposal would change the fundamental framework of privacy in this country. This is long overdue, Americans need and deserve to know that their personal information is safe now and in the future.\u201d</p><p>Specifically, the Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 would:</p><p>Ban the collection, use or sharing of personal data unless specifically allowed by law Ban the use of facial recognition technology Prohibits the use of personal data to discriminate in housing, employment, credit, insurance, and public accommodations; Requires anyone using decision-making algorithms to provide new accountability reports Creates a new, independent agency that is dedicated to protecting individuals\u2019 privacy and the implementation of DATA 2020. The new agency will have rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority, the ability to issue civil penalties for violations of the Act, and a dedicated Office of Civil Rights to protect individuals from discrimination The proposal empowers individuals and state attorneys general to enforce privacy protections and does not preempt more protective state laws Finally, the proposal would require CEO certification of compliance with the Act and contains potential criminal and civil penalties for CEO and Board of Directors</p><p>More information about the legislation can be found here. Senator Brown worked with a diverse group of privacy experts as well as civil rights and consumer organizations. A selection of statements from these organizations appear below, and more can be viewed here.</p><p>\u201cThis bill sets a bold new agenda for privacy. If it becomes law, consumers can breathe a sigh of relief: rather than being expected to wade through a sea of unreadable terms of service and misleading corporate 'privacy policies,' we can rely on a Data Accountability and Transparency Agency to protect us from scams, discrimination, and surveillance. The bill puts the burden of privacy policy where it always should have been: on regulators to protect us from increasingly irresponsible, insecure, and invasive data collection. The bill's sponsors deserve enormous credit for their visionary data policy. This bill is now the gold standard for privacy reform: any future efforts here need to be measured against it,\u201d Frank Pasquale, Professor of Law, University of Maryland Carey School of Law.</p><p>\u201cThe Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 sets a strong standard for data protection. Collection of personal data has expanded dramatically over the last ten years, yet we have no comprehensive federal data protection standards. Data breaches, identity theft, hacking, and data misuse are on the rise. Senator Brown\u2019s bill creates enforceable privacy rights and limits the amount of data companies can collect and keep about us. Critically, it creates a data protection agency to ensure that these rules are followed. EPIC strongly supports Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020,\u201d Caitriona Fitzgerald, Interim Associate Director and Policy Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).</p><p>\u201cSenator Brown's draft Data Accountability and Transparency Act rejects the notice and consent regime that serves data collectors well, but fails consumers. Instead of that system, which counts on consumers to surrender their data for vague down-stream uses, Senator Brown proposes a new and welcome paradigm: it limits data collection to certain permitted uses, and those alone,\u201d Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director, Federal Consumer Program, U.S PIRG.</p><p>\u201cSenator Brown\u2019s privacy bill is among the strongest and most comprehensive put forward in Congress. It contains strong prohibitions on unfair and discriminatory data practices, protects civil rights, has robust rulemaking authority for a new privacy agency and ensures that people can enforce their rights in court. Making the kinds of big changes to the data ecosystem we need, Senator Brown\u2019s bill would help end some of the abusive practices that have made commercial surveillance so pervasive and profitable,\u201d Free Press Action.</p><p>Senator Brown has long fought to protect consumer\u2019s data. He recently sent a letter to the Trump Administration expressing concern about the use of facial recognition technology to gather information on those Americans who joined in protest of systemic racial injustice. He also sent letters to Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the company\u2019s virtual meeting technology, and expressed concerns regarding Zoom\u2019s deceptive practices by inaccurately advertising end-to-end encryption of its virtual meetings. He also joined his colleagues Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J ) Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J ) in questioning information regarding Verily\u2019s screening platform. Finally, Senator Brown joined members of the House and Senate in asking the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to review policies regarding the use of facial recognition technologies in federally assisted housing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3434432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605R-6P41-F0YC-N154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The bill rejects the current, ineffective \"consent\" model for privacy, and instead places strict limits on the collection, use, and sharing of Americans' personal data. The bill contains strong civil rights protections to ensure personal information is not used for discriminatory purposes, as well as a ban on the use of facial recognition technology. Brown's proposal also establishes a new independent agency dedicated to protecting Americans' privacy rights.</p><p>\"Right now, we do not protect people's privacy that means we don't protect their civil rights. We need legislation now more than ever that empowers Americans to control their personal information. No person should have to worry about being spied on, just like no one should worry about their information being bought and sold or stolen,\" said Senator Brown . \"My proposal would change the fundamental framework of privacy in this country.

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) - ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today released a draft privacy bill, the Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020. Brown's proposal creates a new framework that would give Americans the power to hold corporations, big tech, and the government responsible for how they collect and protect personal data. The bill rejects the current, ineffective \"consent\" model for privacy, and instead places strict limits on the collection, use, and sharing of Americans' personal data. The bill contains strong civil rights protections to ensure personal information is not used for discriminatory purposes, as well as a ban on the use of facial recognition technology. Brown's proposal also establishes a new independent agency dedicated to protecting Americans' privacy rights.</p><p>\"Right now, we do not protect people's privacy - that means we don't protect their civil rights. We need legislation now more than ever that empowers Americans to control their personal information. No person should have to worry about being spied on, just like no one should worry about their information being bought and sold or stolen,\" said Senator Brown. \"My proposal would change the fundamental framework of privacy in this country. This is long overdue, Americans need and deserve to know that their personal information is safe now and in the future.\"</p><p>Specifically, the Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 would:</p><p>* Ban the collection, use or sharing of personal data unless specifically allowed by law</p><p>* Ban the use of facial recognition technology</p><p>* Prohibits the use of personal data to discriminate in housing, employment, credit, insurance, and public accommodations;</p><p>* Requires anyone using decision-making algorithms to provide new accountability reports</p><p>* Creates a new, independent agency that is dedicated to protecting individuals' privacy and the implementation of DATA 2020. The new agency will have rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority, the ability to issue civil penalties for violations of the Act, and a dedicated Office of Civil Rights to protect individuals from discrimination</p><p>* The proposal empowers individuals and state attorneys general to enforce privacy protections and does not preempt more protective state laws</p><p>* Finally, the proposal would require CEO certification of compliance with the Act and contains potential criminal and civil penalties for CEO and Board of Directors</p><p>More information about the legislation can be found here <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/one-pager-the_data-accountability-and-transparency-act-of-2020\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/one-pager-the_data-accountability-and-transparency-act-of-2020</url>. Senator Brown worked with a diverse group of privacy experts as well as civil rights and consumer organizations. A selection of statements from these organizations appear below, and more can be viewed here       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/statement-of-support\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/statement-of-support</url>.</p><p>\"This bill sets a bold new agenda for privacy. If it becomes law, consumers can breathe a sigh of relief: rather than being expected to wade through a sea of unreadable terms of service and misleading corporate \"privacy policies,\" we can rely on a Data Accountability and Transparency Agency to protect us from scams, discrimination, and surveillance. The bill puts the burden of privacy policy where it always should have been: on regulators to protect us from increasingly irresponsible, insecure, and invasive data collection. The bill's sponsors deserve enormous credit for their visionary data policy. This bill is now the gold standard for privacy reform: any future efforts here need to be measured against it,\" Frank Pasquale, Professor of Law, University of Maryland Carey School of Law.</p><p>\"The Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 sets a strong standard for data protection. Collection of personal data has expanded dramatically over the last ten years, yet we have no comprehensive federal data protection standards. Data breaches, identity theft, hacking, and data misuse are on the rise. Senator Brown's bill creates enforceable privacy rights and limits the amount of data companies can collect and keep about us. Critically, it creates a data protection agency to ensure that these rules are followed. EPIC strongly supports Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020,\" Caitriona Fitzgerald, Interim Associate Director and Policy Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).</p><p>\"Senator Brown's draft Data Accountability and Transparency Act rejects the notice and consent regime that serves data collectors well, but fails consumers. Instead of that system, which counts on consumers to surrender their data for vague down-stream uses, Senator Brown proposes a new and welcome paradigm: it limits data collection to certain permitted uses, and those alone,\" Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director, Federal Consumer Program, U.S. PIRG.</p><p>\"Senator Brown's privacy bill is among the strongest and most comprehensive put forward in Congress. It contains strong prohibitions on unfair and discriminatory data practices, protects civil rights, has robust rulemaking authority for a new privacy agency and ensures that people can enforce their rights in court. Making the kinds of big changes to the data ecosystem we need, Senator Brown's bill would help end some of the abusive practices that have made commercial surveillance so pervasive and profitable,\" Free Press Action.</p><p>Senator Brown has long fought to protect consumer's data. He recently sent a letter to the Trump Administration expressing concern about the use of facial recognition technology to gather information on those Americans who joined in protest of systemic racial injustice. He also sent letters to Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the company's virtual meeting technology, and expressed concerns regarding Zoom's deceptive practices by inaccurately advertising end-to-end encryption of its virtual meetings. He also joined his colleagues Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in questioning information regarding Verily's screening platform. Finally, Senator Brown joined members of the House and Senate in asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to review policies regarding the use of facial recognition technologies in federally assisted housing.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-proposal-protect-consumers-privacy\">https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-proposal-protect-consumers-privacy</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSM618004K1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605J-CVP1-JCCP-03BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, today released a draft privacy bill, the DataAccountability and Transparency Act of 2020. Brown's proposal creates a new framework that would give Americans the power to hold corporations, big tech, and the government responsible for how they collect and protect personal data. The bill rejects the current, ineffective \"consent\" model for privacy, and instead places strict limits on the collection, use, and sharing of Americans' personal data. The bill contains strong civil rights protections to ensure personal information is not used for discriminatory purposes, as well as a ban on the use of facial recognition technology. Brown's proposal also establishes a new independent agency dedicated to protecting Americans' privacy rights.</p><p>\"Right now, we do not protect people's privacy that means we don't protect their civil rights. We need legislation now more than ever that empowers Americans to control their personal information. No person should have to worry about being spied on, just like no one should worry about their information being bought and sold or stolen,\" said Senator Brown . \"My proposal would change the fundamental framework of privacy in this country. This is long overdue, Americans need and deserve to know that their personal information is safe now and in the future.\"</p><p>Specifically, the DataAccountability and Transparency Act of 2020 would:</p><p>- Ban the collection, use or sharing of personal data unless specifically allowed by law</p><p>- Ban the use of facial recognition technology</p><p>- Prohibits the use of personal data to discriminate in housing, employment, credit, insurance, and public accommodations;</p><p>- Requires anyone using decision-making algorithms to provide new accountability reports</p><p>- Creates a new, independent agency that is dedicated to protecting individuals' privacy and the implementation of DATA 2020. The new agency will have rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority, the ability to issue civil penalties for violations of the Act, and a dedicated Office of Civil Rights to protect individuals from discrimination</p><p>- The proposal empowers individuals and state attorneys general to enforce privacy protections and does not preempt more protective state laws</p><p>- Finally, the proposal would require CEO certification of compliance with the Act and contains potential criminal and civil penalties for CEO and Board of Directors</p><p>More information about the legislation can be found here. Senator Brown worked with a diverse group of privacy experts as well as civil rights and consumer organizations. A selection of statements from these organizations appear below, and more can be viewed here.</p><p>\"This bill sets a bold new agenda for privacy. If it becomes law, consumers can breathe a sigh of relief: rather than being expected to wade through a sea of unreadable terms of service and misleading corporate \"privacy policies,\" we can rely on a Data Accountability and Transparency Agency to protect us from scams, discrimination, and surveillance. The bill puts the burden of privacy policy where it always should have been: on regulators to protect us from increasingly irresponsible, insecure, and invasive data collection. The bill's sponsors deserve enormous credit for their visionary data policy. This bill is now the gold standard for privacy reform: any future efforts here need to be measured against it,\" Frank Pasquale, Professor of Law, University of Maryland Carey School of Law.</p><p>\"The Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 sets a strong standard for data protection. Collection of personal data has expanded dramatically over the last ten years, yet we have no comprehensive federal data protection standards. Data breaches, identity theft, hacking, and data misuse are on the rise. Senator Brown's bill creates enforceable privacy rights and limits the amount of data companies can collect and keep about us. Critically, it creates a data protection agency to ensure that these rules are followed. EPIC strongly supports Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020,\" Caitriona Fitzgerald, Interim Associate Director and Policy Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).</p><p>\"Senator Brown's draft Data Accountability and Transparency Act rejects the notice and consent regime that serves data collectors well, but fails consumers. Instead of that system, which counts on consumers to surrender their data for vague down-stream uses, Senator Brown proposes a new and welcome paradigm: it limits data collection to certain permitted uses, and those alone,\" Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director, Federal Consumer Program, U.S. PIRG.</p><p>\"Senator Brown's privacy bill is among the strongest and most comprehensive put forward in Congress. It contains strong prohibitions on unfair and discriminatory data practices, protects civil rights, has robust rulemaking authority for a new privacy agency and ensures that people can enforce their rights in court. Making the kinds of big changes to the data ecosystem we need, Senator Brown's bill would help end some of the abusive practices that have made commercial surveillance so pervasive and profitable,\" Gaurav Laroia, Senior Policy Counsel, Free Press.</p><p>Senator Brown has long fought to protect consumer's data. He recently sent a letter to the Trump Administration expressing concern about the use of facial recognition technology to gather information on those Americans who joined in protest of systemic racial injustice. He also sent letters to Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the company's virtual meeting technology, and expressed concerns regarding Zoom's deceptive practices by inaccurately advertising end-to-end encryption of its virtual meetings. He also joined his colleagues Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in questioning information regarding Verily's screening platform. Finally, Senator Brown joined members of the House and Senate in asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to review policies regarding the use of facial recognition technologies in federally assisted housing.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123768204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605G-MH11-JCBF-S1YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Also sky-high are the clean energy plans of its anchor tenant, the software giant for which the LEED-certified office tower is named.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Late last month, San Francisco-based Salesforce.com Inc. said the company had invested in its largest renewable energy agreement to date - an 80-megawatt wind energy project in Illinois - en route to reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2022. The project, owned and to be operated by Spain-based EDP Renewables, is expected to light up more than 27,000 homes each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For us, renewable energy done the right way means bringing new renewable energy onto the grid, focusing on grids where new renewable energy is needed,\" said Patrick Flynn, Salesforce's vice president of sustainability. \"Some of the dirtier grids in the country, some of the geographies with less progressive climate policies.\"</p><p>As Bay Area tech giants like Salesforce are increasing their commitment to renewables, so too are state lawmakers. On Monday, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill to eliminate carbon emissions from the state's electricity by 2045. The move comes just days before San Francisco hosts the Global Climate Action Summit -\u00a0where Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff will be speaking.</p><p>\"California is committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the existential threat of climate change,\" Brown said in a statement. \"This bill, and others I will sign this week, help us go in that direction. But have no illusions, California and the rest of the world have miles to go before we achieve zero-carbon emissions.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">Senate Bill 100</url> expedites the state's elimination of fossil fuels and is Brown's latest jab at the Trump administration. The administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change last year and has rolled back fuel economy standards and regulations on coal-fired power plants. Just weeks ago, California       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/state/overview/\">released a state climate assessment</url> that projected a two-thirds decline in water supply from snowpack by 2050, as well as a 77 percent uptick in average area burned by wildfires by 2100.</p><p>Yet many companies have been accelerating their own clean power ambitions for years without legislative prompting. In the United States, corporations have collectively added almost four gigawatts of clean energy to the grid in 2018 so far, more than in any of the past five years, according to the Business Renewables Center. Since 2013, corporate renewable deals total more than 13 gigawatts. \u00a0</p><p>Big tech is certainly leading the charge, in large part countering the massive amount of energy drawn to power data centers across the industry. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/10-facts-know-about-data-centers\">According to the U.S. Department of Energy</url>, the United States is home to about 3 million data centers, which consume more than 2 percent of the nation's electricity.</p><p>Both Apple and Google are already powered by 100 percent renewables; in February, Las Vegas-based Switch said it was partnering with investor Capital Dynamics <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.switch.com/switch-announces-rob-roys-gigawatt-nevada-largest-solar-project-united-states/\">to build the nation's largest solar project</url> - with a capacity of 1 gigabyte in a single plot. Facebook, too, says that it has collectively invested in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/renewable-energy/\">over 3 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy</url>, including more than 2,500 megawatts in the past year alone.</p><p>Earlier this year, biotech giant Genentech unveiled a 6.4-megawatt, 16,000 solar panel installation atop its South San Francisco headquarters. The system adds to the biotech firm's solar arsenal, which already includes a 8.9-megawatt system in Vacaville with 29,000 panels, completed in 2017.</p><p>\"We believe that this has a profound impact on our local communities: as the Bay Area continues to grow at an exponential rate, our panels will provide much-needed relief to the power grid,\" Genentech spokesperson Rebecca Phillips wrote in an email.</p><p>Beyond a positive impact, Salesforce sees its sustainability efforts as good for business - from cutting down energy costs via efficiency measures to satisfying customers, employees and investors alike, according to Flynn. The wind project's location in Southern Illinois is also strategic. It's near some of Salesforce's larger data centers in Chicago, as well as Indianapolis, one of the tech company's major hubs.</p><p>Last year, the company signed onto the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a framework that guides businesses to deliver investors sustainability-specific information. Salesforce also had the company's major environmental claims reviewed by its audit firm, Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>\"The changes that are happening in the investor community with regards to sustainability are so inspiring,\" Flynn said. \"The investor community, as we see it, is really responding and is very interested in what companies are doing around environmental and social issues.\"</p><p>Sustainability scorecards like <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.clickclean.org/international/en/\">Greenpeace's \"Clicking Clean\"</url> (which in 2017 gave Salesforce a 'B' grade overall, though ranked its renewable energy commitment as an 'A') have also pushed companies to be more transparent, according to Priya Barua, manager of strategic partnerships at think tank World Resources Institute's energy program.</p><p>WRI co-runs the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, which helps make buying renewable energy easier for companies like Salesforce. About 140 companies are members worldwide, in some ways even prompting peer pressure across corporate America to become more sustainable, Barua said. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"The cost of the technologies and renewable energy have come down tremendously over the past few years, so it makes economic sense,\" Barua said.</p><p>She also points to the long-term predictability that power purchase agreements can provide - relief from the volatile nature of a utility's fluctuating energy rates. Salesforce's wind investment in Illinois, for instance, is for a 15-year contract.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

The President took a huge victory lap. Did he deserve to take  it?</p><p> BRUCE KASMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Well not  because I think the GDP report is the reflection of his policies, but I  think we should feel good about what it tell us about the U.S. economy,  looking through the headline number which is distorted by a couple of  things, particularly trade. We have as a nice private sector recovery in  demand. We have balanced income growth. We're starting the second half of  these lean inventories and we've got a fiscal stimulus coming through. It  all suggests the economy solid and will continue to grow at a solid base  here.</p><p> KEENE: The President with the tenth Tweet. I think he was going to do with  the 11th Twee this week. And the 11th Tweet, Mr. President, would have been  perfect. And that's the idea of the fiscal stimulus. How much is that  fiscal stimulus going to be? 0.5% of GDP? Do you have a number?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, we think in 2018 and '19, fiscal stimulus is adding about  0.5% per year. There's a little bit of it in the GDP report for the second  quarter both on spending --</p><p> KEENE: But a lot more to come?</p><p> KASMAN: But there's a lot more to come, particularly if the spending side  really does reach its peak if our estimates are right as we turn into 2019.  So we think the economy can probably hold growth at around 3% pace,  something we haven't done during this expansion for much time. And I think  that's a really good back draft in the sense that so far we haven't seen  late cycle pressure build, we haven't seen the fed move in any kind of  aggressive way. So there's nothing really preventing us from continuing to  January solid growth here at least for a little while.</p><p> FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Bruce, what do you worry about? Do  you worry about the fed having to like tight rates much more than expected  in 2019 or do you worry about something else?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think the fed and late cycle dynamics in terms of the wage  pressure starting to put downward pressure on corporate margins is the  central risk of the expansion. I think the good news is it's moving very  slowly. On the immediate side, I think we do have to worry about whether  this trade war turns into war on trade. I mean, obviously we step back from  that last week with the E.U. meeting. But my concern would be that what's  happening here gives businesses a feeling that supply chain's broader trade  patterns are going to be affected permanently and begin to respond to that  in terms of sentiment in their spending.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. What do you wait to see whether that it can be at 3%? Is  there a danger that actually the U.S. economy is overheated? Are we there  again or we just not analyzing what some of the trade and tariffs could do?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think for the next six to nine months, the amount that  trade in tariffs is going to do to add to inflation is a pretty small  amount. I think the bigger question there is sentiment, whether it hurts  sentiment in a negative way. More broadly, I think we have tight labor  markets. I think we have in our future an overheated economy. I don't'  think it's there yet. I don't think the inflation number and the wage  numbers are pointing to that, and that's suggest this is going to move  pretty slowly. KEENE: I've got a controversial chart here. I want to bring it up and,  Bruce, this is about linking politics into your world of GDP forecasting,  which I think is baloney yet we do it every day. So what we've got here,  I'm going to make this bright red so you can see it, really, all. I'll get  this out on Bloomberg out on Twitter. This is the 20-year average here at  3.2%, the world's great. And then with the huge contraction that we had  early, Obama, you come in here down, and the President in this early years  has brought it up just a little bit as well. Within all of your experience,  I mean this President is off labors, boy, do they run and hide when it's  bad and they love to come out when it's good. But can you really link GDP  growth in the public policy?</p><p> KASMAN: Look, there is a fiscal stimulus working through this system and if  we want to champion that. And I wouldn't champion that at this point in the  cycle, it's adding to demand and it's supporting growth. But the broader  story that's improving growth here, which has a global dimension to it and  a domestic dimension, is something that has been growing for two to three  years as we're getting the benefits of very supportive monetary policy as  we're finally getting the healing in the post-financial crisis period come  through the system. So I think it would be a mistake at any point in time  to tie near term economic performance to immediate policy changes.</p><p> KEENE: We're thrilled to have you here at the start of the week with JP  Morgan, Bruce Kasman. He'll continue with us through the hour.</p><p> With us is Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan, and we're thrilled to bring you a  timely discussion and conversation with Chris Marangi. He is with the  Gabelli Funds, of course, on media and on all the infrastructure and things  that hold it together. I must touch on and Mr. Moonves' fate this week, it  is a cross all of the headlines, particularly here in New York City. How  important is Mr. Moonves to CBS for shareholders and investors?</p><p> CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Yes. Well, one of the interview  questions I give is do you buy asset or management given a choice. We had a  great situation at CBS where we had both. But ultimately, we want to buy  the asset and the assets are the same. Les has done a great job and he is  important to the story though.</p><p> KEENE: What do you do with CBS right now? Do you just wait out the soap  opera?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, yes, I think (inaudible) and we think about it as a 2x2  matrix. CBS, what's the value of CBS with Moonves without him, what's the  value of the combination of CBS and Viacom with Moonves, without him. The  answer is that CBS is worth more in all those cases, but the market has  increased a probability that we're going to be without Moonves.</p><p> KEENE: After what we've been through with Fox, Disney in all, there's been  all sorts of discussions of CBS combining almost on distribution reasons  with other networks, CNN mention and others as well. Is that they're  future, they've just got to find distribution?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, scale is critical in this business. You saw obviously  Comcast trying to achieve bigger scale with five since he's doing that  with. So I think eventually you'll see CBS a somebody else. I don't know  who will be that.</p><p> KEENE: You don't know how to be right, you don't want to inform us on a  Monday how many it would affect. Inform us on what that occurred last week.  We see a real dominance, a separation in technology of Google and Amazon  and others, Facebook and Twitter, disappointing shareholders? What's yours  and Mario's observation of that?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, what we learned last week is the fangs just don't go up all  the time. So, listen, Facebook said two bad words on their call. They  talked about deceleration and margin compression, and growth investors  don't want to see that. I think long-term is probably doing the right thing  for the stock. And The stock is basically back to where it was at the  beginning of the year. So we're not terribly distressed by it.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. But, Chris, overall, and good morning from London,  what's your biggest concern when it comes to fanged stocks? Anyway, we're  not really leaving the bubble bursting in the year 2000, right? This is  different, and yet there are fault line.</p><p> MARANGI: It's clearly different than the late 90's early 2000's. Valuation  are rich. I don't think they're overly stretched for most member of the  fang. There are differences obviously between members of the fang. And as  Tom mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of a decoupling. I think,  frankly, Facebook's results make Google results look although much more  better because they did a terrific job of navigating some of the changes in  regulation and the concerns over privacy.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. But what do you do with the snap? What do you do with  Twitter?</p><p> KASMAN: I think those are -- those don't quite have a scale. Obviously,  Twitter has been quite a platform. They helped the President quite a bit.  And their stocks have done well but obviously a lot of change there.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. Chris, overall, I know we're also expecting Apple. I mean,  how do you take advantage of A.I.? If you look at the big trend in the next  5, 10, 15 years, do you go just for chipmakers in, for example, Asian  markets or do you go after some of these big tech stocks?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, I think one of the things that we like are recurring revenue  businesses. And the services business at Apple is growing a very attractive  part of that business. They have a global platform for music and  entertainment. So we like that aspect of stock. Obviously, it's cheap.  You've got Warren Buffet buying it.</p><p> KEENE: Here are the (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. The backdrop is Kasman's  optimism of JP Morgan economy. When you filter through earnings, which is  part of economics, when the corporate might get out there, what do you see  12 months more (ph)? Are you going to tell Marangi to shut up and load the  boat here on a Monday?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think what you're seeing a pretty healthy upturn in  corporate profits that's supported the macro fundamentals. I think what's  nice right now is we have a reasonably balanced income dynamic in the U.S.  and globally with employment growing close to a decade high and corporate  profits continuing to grow. We worry tight labor market will eventually  upset the apple cart by start to create a wedge between wages and  productivity, compressed margins, it's going to happen but it's not  happening now. KEENE: But to the savings revisions we saw in the GDP report, which to me  were the biggest thing in the report, Chris, people have the disposable  income to do media, don't they?</p><p> MARANGI: They do, but they're saving money by -- some are by are cutting  the cord and putting more -- keeping more money in their pockets.</p><p> KEENE: But the money they're utting accord is going to -- I would say,  suggest, it's going to other media sources, right?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, it's going to broad band, for example. Which is why we like  -- still like the cable stocks. Broad band plays as oppose to the view.</p><p> KEENE: So Comcast now has a screening value after the collapse since the  merge?</p><p> MARANGI: It was and it is even more valued today as a starter.</p><p> LACQUA: (Inaudible ) overall, if you look at consolidation, I don't know  whether this is domestic, so it's U.S. or whether you lost possibility of  an outsider coming and buying some of the domestic players?</p><p> MARANGI: Yes. So you've got obviously sprints which is still backed  Softbank and T-Mobile backed by Deutsche Telecom, trying to come together.  If that happens, I think it will be -- a lot of sense for them to buy an  infrastructure provider like charter, which will be the one for sale. I  don't think Comcast is for sales. So those would be two, if I had in the  past talk about LTs, of course, based on Europe has a business I the U.S.,  (inaudible) U.S. also being a consolidator. But they are, at the moment,  financially stressed and probably can't do anything.</p><p> LACQUA: Bruce How are a lot of these deals going to be financed if they  come back to fruition? If it's almost the end of the era of cheap money,  does it impact actually cross border consolidation?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think right now, it's the end of the era of emergency  priced money. But if we look at U.S. policy rates being just at the rate of  inflation, if we look at an ECB that still has negative interest rates and  we have a BOJ which is isn't going to be moving the short rate any time  soon, I think it will be a mistake to say that we're having an issue here  with high interest rates and access to credit. I think we're at still a  pretty favorable environment for credit. And in fact, I think it's  improving in Europe and in the emerging markets compared to where we were  for most of the last three or four years. And I don't think credit and  interest rates are an obstacle here for deals or for the global economy to  move forward.</p><p> LACQUA: All right. Bruce, thank you so much. Bruce Kasman there of JP  Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli funds both stay with us.</p><p> KEENE: Let me go to something Bruce Kasman has got his eye on and sort of  tangential. But on a Monday, we're struggling to find things to talk about.  I'm kidding. We've got Turkish lira up. We're doing this for a quick clear  off (ph) and in today chart in the Bloomberg, another leg up on the 24th of  July. And, again, it was just -- it's another EM (inaudible), Bruce Kasman.  And whether it's Turkish lira, Brazilian real, on and on, they're all  idiosyncratic until they're not. And you and I remember the third week of  August 1998 when we got to until they're not. How close are we until  they're not?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think the point you're making is an important one, which is  we don't actually always see these interactions take place. But as we're  looking at the world right now, we don't see the big rise in global  interest rates. We see a big backdrop on growth that's pretty solid. We can  recognize that the Turkish story and the Brazilian story and the Argentine  story have very idiosyncratic elements to it. So we don't think this is  going to spill over. But I do think any time we're seeing the fed  tightening, any time we're seeing some stress points here, we have to worry  that there could be spillovers that were not appreciated.</p><p> KEENE: Is your call strong dollar? Does John Norman (ph) say, strong dollar  up?</p><p> KASMAN: No. Actually our call is that the dollar strength, given that the  trade story doesn't intensify that the dollar is actually going to weaken a  little bit in the second half of the year as we feel better about global  growth, particularly global growth outside the U.S. And we begin to see  some modest weakening in the dollar off of that.</p><p> LACQUA: Bruce, do you worry about the fact that despite tariffs and despite  trade, there seems to be a need (ph) from central banks to start  normalizing. Is it the right time worldwide in the economy to do so?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, again, I want to emphasize, the ECB is not going to be  raising rates for a year. The BOJ, even if it makes a tweak to a deal  controlled target today is not moving policy rates up. The amount of  tightening we're getting in global central banks is extremely small and  coming from very easy levels. I think the real question we're asking right  now is the fed that's moving steadily and is pushing up dollar interest  rates in a world in which dollar funding is very important, whether there's  a stress point on that, not whether not we're getting tight or it's really  mid (inaudible) tightening in financial conditions because of what central  banks are doing.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. But on the fed's -- Secretary Mnuchin suggested yesterday that  it's fine for the Federal Reserve to raise rates even if President Trump  attacks him. I mean, this is like a central bank's worst nightmare.</p><p> KASMAN: Well, there's definitely, I think, an issue around the independence  of the fed. But I think the fed is pretty insulated here and understands  what its role is. So we don't think the fed is going to be responding to  political pressure. We think the fed is a force and motion that's going to  move a quarter a percent each quarter here for a while. It's still got  another two or three moves at least to get back to neutral.</p><p> KEENE: Well, you've talked about the political forces that out there. And,  of course, Bruce Kasman, I know Chairman Powell is an enemy of the people.  Let's cover this with Chris Marangi right now of Gabelli Funds. The  President had a massive Tweet storm this weekend on the press. And, of  course, he went after the newspapers, Amazon, Washington Post in that. But  in your area, Chris, it's really about the power of cable news and the  whole dynamic that all of us are living every day. I mean, I've got my own  axe (ph) to grind in all that. But how do you, as an investors, perceive  the power of cable news into the election and particularly into the  presidential election of 2020?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, cable news is very powerful. It's a very valuable asset for  and very profitable asset for Fox, as well as for Comcast. Actually,  Comcast called out MSNBC, shows the other side of the spectrum is being a  strong driver for growth in a bad company. So they're gathering eyeballs  (ph) perhaps to the detriment of other forms of entertainment. We saw that  in the last election cycle. Maybe see it again now. But, again, very  profitable for those networks, very profitable for the broadcasters as  well.</p><p> KEENE: Can you find any value imprint? I mean, we see the uproar of the Los  Angeles Times. Remember (inaudible) used to be with Bloomberg. I should  mention, folks, going now to assist in that effort. But is there any value  for GAMCO (ph) and Gabelli in traditional print?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, it's very difficult to find (inaudible) companies these  days. So we have a pretty exposure with the Wall Street Journal with News  Corp (ph). And I think the Wall Street Journal is somewhat unique and  having -- been able to make the transition in part at least to digital.</p><p> LACQUA: Bruce, I don't know whether we're -- it's difficult, right, for  markets to understand the deep shifts that we're seeing culturally and in  our society. This feels like a big question that could be theoretical,  theological, whatever you want to call it, but how does it play out in the  markets five to ten years from now?</p><p> KASMAN: I think that's a really hard question to get our hands around. But  I think the point you're making is right. There are certain things  happening now, which are reflected in trade policy, reflected in political  outcomes. We're seeing reflected in events like Brexit which do, I think,  come out of accumulation of pressure points building over the last five or  ten years. And they're going to play out over the next five or ten years. I  don't have a clear crystal ball on how these things play out but we have a  demographic issue, we have slow underlying supply side performance. I think  there are pressure points here that are going to continue to build. And the  political implications of this are hard to see but they are, I think,  worrisome.</p><p> KEENE: Bruce Kasman with us and Chris Marangi as well, lots more to talk  about here in the hour.</p><p> LACQUA: Now, still with us, Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of  Gabelli Funds. Chris, when you look at, I guess, some of the big names out  there, I don't whether we're at the point where we say some of the just  won't survive, whether if you look at Snap or other ones and say, we don't  know how it creates values in four to five years, or do you assume that  they'll bought, repackaged and morph into something else?</p><p> MARANGI: Yes. I'm not sure if they'll be standalone entities. Scale, as I  mentioned this earlier, it is important to the media industry, it's  important to the internet industry as well. These companies thrive on data.  Data is contentious (ph). So I think John -- I would agree with John that  the cost of complying with privacy laws will go up, which will further  drive scale and probably consolidation in that industry.</p><p> LACQUA: Chris, what does that -- yes. Chris, again, what does that mean for  actually the end consumer? What does it mean for regulation? Are you  assuming just more and more of it?</p><p> MARANGI: Yes. I think -- as I think one of the reasons that Facebook is  investing in the experience is, in fact, to head off or try to head off or  delay regulation because they have had -- companies like Facebook and  Twitter have had such a big impact on the political discourse in this  country and around the world.</p><p> KEENE: With our single best chart right now, Chris Marangi can weigh in on  this inflation just in real ten-year JGB in Japan. No, Bruce Kasman is  going to help us out. Chris, dive in here if you want. I'm fascinated by  the idea of you go from deflation to disinflation to actual tangible in  Japan, and one (inaudible) real rate. Here's the chart, down we go with a  long-term real rate decline in Japan. And we get some real improvement with  deflation. But then inflation comes in. And even if the yield comes up a  little, that inflation squeezes that real rate. What does that mean to the  people of Japan and to the banks?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I want to be careful here because all of the inflation that  we've seen in the last year in Japan is energy prices. If you strip that  out and you look at the core really --</p><p> KEENE: And your real rate is better than it is?</p><p> KASMAN: Yes. And I think what is very troubling in Japan right now is that  we have strong growth, we have a BOJ that's thinking about beginning to  make an adjustment away from a GL (ph) controlled policy. But underlying  inflation hasn't moved really anywhere closer to the BOJ's target and  market measures of inflation expectation are reflecting some loss or  credibility in the BOJ.</p><p> KEENE: Except that comment sounds a lot like Governor Carney a year ago,  nine months or whatever. And I understand the skills and amplitude are  different. But it seems like all of these central banks as we get the same  problem, they're rationalizing a higher space. And you're talking about  enthusiasm of GDP. But reality, Bruce, is the inflation just is not there,  is it?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think when you look at the inflation profile, there is a  modest but very modest upward trajectory that you see in most of the  developed world. I think what's unique about Japan is Japan is trying to  dig itself out of over two decades of deflationary psychology. And that  puts it in a very different place than what we're talking about the Bank of  England or the fed.</p><p> KEENE: And what you just said that is brilliant, I'm going to steal the  word from you all this week, is inflation profile, because inflation makeup  of each country, each culture is different. I mean, in almost -- Chris,  every industry has a different inflation profile. I mean, this is not a  cookie cutter central bank. There're some real nuances in these three  meetings, right?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, there is no doubt. And I think while the fed has an easy  (ph) meeting this week and the Bank of England has a tough call, which we  think they're going to take the step to tighten, the BOJ is by far, I  think, the most interesting one. Because what the BOJ is really struggling  with is actually missing its inflation objective and actually the last  reading is coming in low with a concern about financial stability of what  is you're doing in terms of squeezing out bank profitability</p><p> LACQUA: Bruce, when you look at BOE, a lot of people are saying, look, they  may hike. But actually, when would you hike when the uncertainty of Brexit  is looming large, you have no idea of what kind of trade they'll do and you  don't have any idea at this point whether the U.K. will crash out of the  E.U. So why hike now? Is it a problem of credibility?</p><p> KASMAN: I think your point is a good one. You have all the Brexit  uncertainty still hanging over your head. But as a central bank, what  you're seeing is growth start to rebound after a hit over the last year.  You're seeing wages move higher. And you're really being frustrated by what  is still a very weak supply side productivity. Your policy rates are less  than 1%. So I think you're kind of balancing risks and leaning against it.  What the Bank of England is not doing is suggesting us that we've got a  significant rate hike path ahead but they are looking like they're willing  to take the step.</p><p> LACQUA: What is the single biggest mistake that a central bank can do now?  Is it tightening too soon or tightening too late?</p><p> KASMAN: Well, I think the biggest mistake would be for the BOJ to tighten  right now because I think its credibility is at risk here. And we do have,  I think, the deep hole we're digging ourselves out of in terms of trying to  get the psychology right. I think if you look at the Bank of England, the  fed, these are issues which are right now more on the margin. Obviously,  there will be big issues down the road at some point.</p><p> KEENE: Chris Marangi with us right now. Compared (ph) to your research  notice or bargain, there're bargains out there, what shares, what sector of  shares can you acquire this morning?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, also we like the (inaudible). We talked about cable. The  cable stocks are around sale after Comcast's ill-fated bid for Fox</p><p> KEENE: And your cash flows are still persistent.</p><p> MARANGI: Cash flows are still terrific. It's all about broad band and the  shift on video to broad band. And that, I think, is finally being  recognized as the driver for that.</p><p> KEENE: Is the iPhone Bryan Roberts friend?</p><p> MARANGI: Well, long-term, 5G wireless will get more competitive with the  wire broad band product. But that's not something I worry about today. And  kind of just thinking about it, they're getting to the wireless business  themselves. I would think Netflix, contrary to some people's opinion, is  actually Comcast's friend because it drives broad band uptake (ph).</p><p> KEENE: Yes. Is YouTube TV of value?</p><p> MARANGI: YouTube TV is cheaper than the big bundle. You don't get quite as  much as you do in the big bundle. I think if you look at it on the breadth  of choice and the Claudia (ph) content, the bundle is still probably your  best bet if you've got a big family.</p><p> KEENE: Great. Chris, thank you so much for the briefing, particularly on  the (inaudible). Bruce Kasman, thank you. As always, I greatly appreciate  the Friday memo.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The President took a huge victory lap. Did he deserve to take it?</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Well not because I think the GDP report is the reflection of his policies, but I think we should feel good about what it tell us about the U.S. economy, looking through the headline number which is distorted by a couple of things, particularly trade. We have as a nice private sector recovery in demand. We have balanced income growth. We're starting the second half of these lean inventories and we've got a fiscal stimulus coming through. It all suggests the economy solid and will continue to grow at a solid base here.</p><p>KEENE: The President with the tenth Tweet. I think he was going to do with the 11th Twee this week. And the 11th Tweet, Mr. President, would have been perfect. And that's the idea of the fiscal stimulus. How much is that fiscal stimulus going to be? 0.5% of GDP? Do you have a number?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, we think in 2018 and '19, fiscal stimulus is adding about 0.5% per year. There's a little bit of it in the GDP report for the second quarter both on spending --</p><p>KEENE: But a lot more to come?</p><p>KASMAN: But there's a lot more to come, particularly if the spending side really does reach its peak if our estimates are right as we turn into 2019. So we think the economy can probably hold growth at around 3% pace, something we haven't done during this expansion for much time. And I think that's a really good back draft in the sense that so far we haven't seen late cycle pressure build, we haven't seen the fed move in any kind of aggressive way. So there's nothing really preventing us from continuing to January solid growth here at least for a little while.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Bruce, what do you worry about? Do you worry about the fed having to like tight rates much more than expected in 2019 or do you worry about something else?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the fed and late cycle dynamics in terms of the wage pressure starting to put downward pressure on corporate margins is the central risk of the expansion. I think the good news is it's moving very slowly. On the immediate side, I think we do have to worry about whether this trade war turns into war on trade. I mean, obviously we step back from that last week with the E.U. meeting. But my concern would be that what's happening here gives businesses a feeling that supply chain's broader trade patterns are going to be affected permanently and begin to respond to that in terms of sentiment in their spending.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. What do you wait to see whether that it can be at 3%? Is there a danger that actually the U.S. economy is overheated? Are we there again or we just not analyzing what some of the trade and tariffs could do?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think for the next six to nine months, the amount that trade in tariffs is going to do to add to inflation is a pretty small amount. I think the bigger question there is sentiment, whether it hurts sentiment in a negative way. More broadly, I think we have tight labor markets. I think we have in our future an overheated economy. I don't' think it's there yet. I don't think the inflation number and the wage numbers are pointing to that, and that's suggest this is going to move pretty slowly. KEENE: I've got a controversial chart here. I want to bring it up and, Bruce, this is about linking politics into your world of GDP forecasting, which I think is baloney yet we do it every day. So what we've got here, I'm going to make this bright red so you can see it, really, all. I'll get this out on Bloomberg out on Twitter. This is the 20-year average here at 3.2%, the world's great. And then with the huge contraction that we had early, Obama, you come in here down, and the President in this early years has brought it up just a little bit as well. Within all of your experience, I mean this President is off labors, boy, do they run and hide when it's bad and they love to come out when it's good. But can you really link GDP growth in the public policy?</p><p>KASMAN: Look, there is a fiscal stimulus working through this system and if we want to champion that. And I wouldn't champion that at this point in the cycle, it's adding to demand and it's supporting growth. But the broader story that's improving growth here, which has a global dimension to it and a domestic dimension, is something that has been growing for two to three years as we're getting the benefits of very supportive monetary policy as we're finally getting the healing in the post-financial crisis period come through the system. So I think it would be a mistake at any point in time to tie near term economic performance to immediate policy changes.</p><p>KEENE: We're thrilled to have you here at the start of the week with JP Morgan, Bruce Kasman. He'll continue with us through the hour.</p><p>With us is Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan, and we're thrilled to bring you a timely discussion and conversation with Chris Marangi. He is with the Gabelli Funds, of course, on media and on all the infrastructure and things that hold it together. I must touch on and Mr. Moonves' fate this week, it is a cross all of the headlines, particularly here in New York City. How important is Mr. Moonves to CBS for shareholders and investors?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Yes. Well, one of the interview questions I give is do you buy asset or management given a choice. We had a great situation at CBS where we had both. But ultimately, we want to buy the asset and the assets are the same. Les has done a great job and he is important to the story though.</p><p>KEENE: What do you do with CBS right now? Do you just wait out the soap opera?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, yes, I think (inaudible) and we think about it as a 2x2 matrix. CBS, what's the value of CBS with Moonves without him, what's the value of the combination of CBS and Viacom with Moonves, without him. The answer is that CBS is worth more in all those cases, but the market has increased a probability that we're going to be without Moonves.</p><p>KEENE: After what we've been through with Fox, Disney in all, there's been all sorts of discussions of CBS combining almost on distribution reasons with other networks, CNN mention and others as well. Is that they're future, they've just got to find distribution?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, scale is critical in this business. You saw obviously Comcast trying to achieve bigger scale with five since he's doing that with. So I think eventually you'll see CBS a somebody else. I don't know who will be that.</p><p>KEENE: You don't know how to be right, you don't want to inform us on a Monday how many it would affect. Inform us on what that occurred last week. We see a real dominance, a separation in technology of Google and Amazon and others, Facebook and Twitter, disappointing shareholders? What's yours and Mario's observation of that?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, what we learned last week is the fangs just don't go up all the time. So, listen, Facebook said two bad words on their call. They talked about deceleration and margin compression, and growth investors don't want to see that. I think long-term is probably doing the right thing for the stock. And The stock is basically back to where it was at the beginning of the year. So we're not terribly distressed by it.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But, Chris, overall, and good morning from London, what's your biggest concern when it comes to fanged stocks? Anyway, we're not really leaving the bubble bursting in the year 2000, right? This is different, and yet there are fault line.</p><p>MARANGI: It's clearly different than the late 90's early 2000's. Valuation are rich. I don't think they're overly stretched for most member of the fang. There are differences obviously between members of the fang. And as Tom mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of a decoupling. I think, frankly, Facebook's results make Google results look although much more better because they did a terrific job of navigating some of the changes in regulation and the concerns over privacy.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But what do you do with the snap? What do you do with Twitter?</p><p>KASMAN: I think those are -- those don't quite have a scale. Obviously, Twitter has been quite a platform. They helped the President quite a bit. And their stocks have done well but obviously a lot of change there.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Chris, overall, I know we're also expecting Apple. I mean, how do you take advantage of A.I.? If you look at the big trend in the next 5, 10, 15 years, do you go just for chipmakers in, for example, Asian markets or do you go after some of these big tech stocks?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, I think one of the things that we like are recurring revenue businesses. And the services business at Apple is growing a very attractive part of that business. They have a global platform for music and entertainment. So we like that aspect of stock. Obviously, it's cheap. You've got Warren Buffet buying it.</p><p>KEENE: Here are the (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. The backdrop is Kasman's optimism of JP Morgan economy. When you filter through earnings, which is part of economics, when the corporate might get out there, what do you see 12 months more (ph)? Are you going to tell Marangi to shut up and load the boat here on a Monday?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think what you're seeing a pretty healthy upturn in corporate profits that's supported the macro fundamentals. I think what's nice right now is we have a reasonably balanced income dynamic in the U.S. and globally with employment growing close to a decade high and corporate profits continuing to grow. We worry tight labor market will eventually upset the apple cart by start to create a wedge between wages and productivity, compressed margins, it's going to happen but it's not happening now. KEENE: But to the savings revisions we saw in the GDP report, which to me were the biggest thing in the report, Chris, people have the disposable income to do media, don't they?</p><p>MARANGI: They do, but they're saving money by -- some are by are cutting the cord and putting more -- keeping more money in their pockets.</p><p>KEENE: But the money they're utting accord is going to -- I would say, suggest, it's going to other media sources, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's going to broad band, for example. Which is why we like -- still like the cable stocks. Broad band plays as oppose to the view.</p><p>KEENE: So Comcast now has a screening value after the collapse since the merge?</p><p>MARANGI: It was and it is even more valued today as a starter.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible ) overall, if you look at consolidation, I don't know whether this is domestic, so it's U.S. or whether you lost possibility of an outsider coming and buying some of the domestic players?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. So you've got obviously sprints which is still backed Softbank and T-Mobile backed by Deutsche Telecom, trying to come together. If that happens, I think it will be -- a lot of sense for them to buy an infrastructure provider like charter, which will be the one for sale. I don't think Comcast is for sales. So those would be two, if I had in the past talk about LTs, of course, based on Europe has a business I the U.S., (inaudible) U.S. also being a consolidator. But they are, at the moment, financially stressed and probably can't do anything.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce How are a lot of these deals going to be financed if they come back to fruition? If it's almost the end of the era of cheap money, does it impact actually cross border consolidation?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think right now, it's the end of the era of emergency priced money. But if we look at U.S. policy rates being just at the rate of inflation, if we look at an ECB that still has negative interest rates and we have a BOJ which is isn't going to be moving the short rate any time soon, I think it will be a mistake to say that we're having an issue here with high interest rates and access to credit. I think we're at still a pretty favorable environment for credit. And in fact, I think it's improving in Europe and in the emerging markets compared to where we were for most of the last three or four years. And I don't think credit and interest rates are an obstacle here for deals or for the global economy to move forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Bruce, thank you so much. Bruce Kasman there of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli funds both stay with us.</p><p>KEENE: Let me go to something Bruce Kasman has got his eye on and sort of tangential. But on a Monday, we're struggling to find things to talk about. I'm kidding. We've got Turkish lira up. We're doing this for a quick clear off (ph) and in today chart in the Bloomberg, another leg up on the 24th of July. And, again, it was just -- it's another EM (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. And whether it's Turkish lira, Brazilian real, on and on, they're all idiosyncratic until they're not. And you and I remember the third week of August 1998 when we got to until they're not. How close are we until they're not?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the point you're making is an important one, which is we don't actually always see these interactions take place. But as we're looking at the world right now, we don't see the big rise in global interest rates. We see a big backdrop on growth that's pretty solid. We can recognize that the Turkish story and the Brazilian story and the Argentine story have very idiosyncratic elements to it. So we don't think this is going to spill over. But I do think any time we're seeing the fed tightening, any time we're seeing some stress points here, we have to worry that there could be spillovers that were not appreciated.</p><p>KEENE: Is your call strong dollar? Does John Norman (ph) say, strong dollar up?</p><p>KASMAN: No. Actually our call is that the dollar strength, given that the trade story doesn't intensify that the dollar is actually going to weaken a little bit in the second half of the year as we feel better about global growth, particularly global growth outside the U.S. And we begin to see some modest weakening in the dollar off of that.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, do you worry about the fact that despite tariffs and despite trade, there seems to be a need (ph) from central banks to start normalizing. Is it the right time worldwide in the economy to do so?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, again, I want to emphasize, the ECB is not going to be raising rates for a year. The BOJ, even if it makes a tweak to a deal controlled target today is not moving policy rates up. The amount of tightening we're getting in global central banks is extremely small and coming from very easy levels. I think the real question we're asking right now is the fed that's moving steadily and is pushing up dollar interest rates in a world in which dollar funding is very important, whether there's a stress point on that, not whether not we're getting tight or it's really mid (inaudible) tightening in financial conditions because of what central banks are doing.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. But on the fed's -- Secretary Mnuchin suggested yesterday that it's fine for the Federal Reserve to raise rates even if President Trump attacks him. I mean, this is like a central bank's worst nightmare.</p><p>KASMAN: Well, there's definitely, I think, an issue around the independence of the fed. But I think the fed is pretty insulated here and understands what its role is. So we don't think the fed is going to be responding to political pressure. We think the fed is a force and motion that's going to move a quarter a percent each quarter here for a while. It's still got another two or three moves at least to get back to neutral.</p><p>KEENE: Well, you've talked about the political forces that out there. And, of course, Bruce Kasman, I know Chairman Powell is an enemy of the people. Let's cover this with Chris Marangi right now of Gabelli Funds. The President had a massive Tweet storm this weekend on the press. And, of course, he went after the newspapers, Amazon, Washington Post in that. But in your area, Chris, it's really about the power of cable news and the whole dynamic that all of us are living every day. I mean, I've got my own axe (ph) to grind in all that. But how do you, as an investors, perceive the power of cable news into the election and particularly into the presidential election of 2020?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, cable news is very powerful. It's a very valuable asset for and very profitable asset for Fox, as well as for Comcast. Actually, Comcast called out MSNBC, shows the other side of the spectrum is being a strong driver for growth in a bad company. So they're gathering eyeballs (ph) perhaps to the detriment of other forms of entertainment. We saw that in the last election cycle. Maybe see it again now. But, again, very profitable for those networks, very profitable for the broadcasters as well.</p><p>KEENE: Can you find any value imprint? I mean, we see the uproar of the Los Angeles Times. Remember (inaudible) used to be with Bloomberg. I should mention, folks, going now to assist in that effort. But is there any value for GAMCO (ph) and Gabelli in traditional print?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's very difficult to find (inaudible) companies these days. So we have a pretty exposure with the Wall Street Journal with News Corp (ph). And I think the Wall Street Journal is somewhat unique and having -- been able to make the transition in part at least to digital.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, I don't know whether we're -- it's difficult, right, for markets to understand the deep shifts that we're seeing culturally and in our society. This feels like a big question that could be theoretical, theological, whatever you want to call it, but how does it play out in the markets five to ten years from now?</p><p>KASMAN: I think that's a really hard question to get our hands around. But I think the point you're making is right. There are certain things happening now, which are reflected in trade policy, reflected in political outcomes. We're seeing reflected in events like Brexit which do, I think, come out of accumulation of pressure points building over the last five or ten years. And they're going to play out over the next five or ten years. I don't have a clear crystal ball on how these things play out but we have a demographic issue, we have slow underlying supply side performance. I think there are pressure points here that are going to continue to build. And the political implications of this are hard to see but they are, I think, worrisome.</p><p>KEENE: Bruce Kasman with us and Chris Marangi as well, lots more to talk about here in the hour.</p><p>LACQUA: Now, still with us, Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli Funds. Chris, when you look at, I guess, some of the big names out there, I don't whether we're at the point where we say some of the just won't survive, whether if you look at Snap or other ones and say, we don't know how it creates values in four to five years, or do you assume that they'll bought, repackaged and morph into something else?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I'm not sure if they'll be standalone entities. Scale, as I mentioned this earlier, it is important to the media industry, it's important to the internet industry as well. These companies thrive on data. Data is contentious (ph). So I think John -- I would agree with John that the cost of complying with privacy laws will go up, which will further drive scale and probably consolidation in that industry.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, what does that -- yes. Chris, again, what does that mean for actually the end consumer? What does it mean for regulation? Are you assuming just more and more of it?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I think -- as I think one of the reasons that Facebook is investing in the experience is, in fact, to head off or try to head off or delay regulation because they have had -- companies like Facebook and Twitter have had such a big impact on the political discourse in this country and around the world.</p><p>KEENE: With our single best chart right now, Chris Marangi can weigh in on this inflation just in real ten-year JGB in Japan. No, Bruce Kasman is going to help us out. Chris, dive in here if you want. I'm fascinated by the idea of you go from deflation to disinflation to actual tangible in Japan, and one (inaudible) real rate. Here's the chart, down we go with a long-term real rate decline in Japan. And we get some real improvement with deflation. But then inflation comes in. And even if the yield comes up a little, that inflation squeezes that real rate. What does that mean to the people of Japan and to the banks?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I want to be careful here because all of the inflation that we've seen in the last year in Japan is energy prices. If you strip that out and you look at the core really --</p><p>KEENE: And your real rate is better than it is?</p><p>KASMAN: Yes. And I think what is very troubling in Japan right now is that we have strong growth, we have a BOJ that's thinking about beginning to make an adjustment away from a GL (ph) controlled policy. But underlying inflation hasn't moved really anywhere closer to the BOJ's target and market measures of inflation expectation are reflecting some loss or credibility in the BOJ.</p><p>KEENE: Except that comment sounds a lot like Governor Carney a year ago, nine months or whatever. And I understand the skills and amplitude are different. But it seems like all of these central banks as we get the same problem, they're rationalizing a higher space. And you're talking about enthusiasm of GDP. But reality, Bruce, is the inflation just is not there, is it?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think when you look at the inflation profile, there is a modest but very modest upward trajectory that you see in most of the developed world. I think what's unique about Japan is Japan is trying to dig itself out of over two decades of deflationary psychology. And that puts it in a very different place than what we're talking about the Bank of England or the fed.</p><p>KEENE: And what you just said that is brilliant, I'm going to steal the word from you all this week, is inflation profile, because inflation makeup of each country, each culture is different. I mean, in almost -- Chris, every industry has a different inflation profile. I mean, this is not a cookie cutter central bank. There're some real nuances in these three meetings, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, there is no doubt. And I think while the fed has an easy (ph) meeting this week and the Bank of England has a tough call, which we think they're going to take the step to tighten, the BOJ is by far, I think, the most interesting one. Because what the BOJ is really struggling with is actually missing its inflation objective and actually the last reading is coming in low with a concern about financial stability of what is you're doing in terms of squeezing out bank profitability</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, when you look at BOE, a lot of people are saying, look, they may hike. But actually, when would you hike when the uncertainty of Brexit is looming large, you have no idea of what kind of trade they'll do and you don't have any idea at this point whether the U.K. will crash out of the E.U. So why hike now? Is it a problem of credibility?</p><p>KASMAN: I think your point is a good one. You have all the Brexit uncertainty still hanging over your head. But as a central bank, what you're seeing is growth start to rebound after a hit over the last year. You're seeing wages move higher. And you're really being frustrated by what is still a very weak supply side productivity. Your policy rates are less than 1%. So I think you're kind of balancing risks and leaning against it. What the Bank of England is not doing is suggesting us that we've got a significant rate hike path ahead but they are looking like they're willing to take the step.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the single biggest mistake that a central bank can do now? Is it tightening too soon or tightening too late?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the biggest mistake would be for the BOJ to tighten right now because I think its credibility is at risk here. And we do have, I think, the deep hole we're digging ourselves out of in terms of trying to get the psychology right. I think if you look at the Bank of England, the fed, these are issues which are right now more on the margin. Obviously, there will be big issues down the road at some point.</p><p>KEENE: Chris Marangi with us right now. Compared (ph) to your research notice or bargain, there're bargains out there, what shares, what sector of shares can you acquire this morning?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, also we like the (inaudible). We talked about cable. The cable stocks are around sale after Comcast's ill-fated bid for Fox</p><p>KEENE: And your cash flows are still persistent.</p><p>MARANGI: Cash flows are still terrific. It's all about broad band and the shift on video to broad band. And that, I think, is finally being recognized as the driver for that.</p><p>KEENE: Is the iPhone Bryan Roberts friend?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, long-term, 5G wireless will get more competitive with the wire broad band product. But that's not something I worry about today. And kind of just thinking about it, they're getting to the wireless business themselves. I would think Netflix, contrary to some people's opinion, is actually Comcast's friend because it drives broad band uptake (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Is YouTube TV of value?</p><p>MARANGI: YouTube TV is cheaper than the big bundle. You don't get quite as much as you do in the big bundle. I think if you look at it on the breadth of choice and the Claudia (ph) content, the bundle is still probably your best bet if you've got a big family.</p><p>KEENE: Great. Chris, thank you so much for the briefing, particularly on the (inaudible). Bruce Kasman, thank you. As always, I greatly appreciate the Friday memo.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The President took a huge victory lap. Did he deserve to take  it?</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Well not  because I think the GDP report is the reflection of his policies, but I  think we should feel good about what it tell us about the U.S. economy,  looking through the headline number which is distorted by a couple of  things, particularly trade. We have as a nice private sector recovery in  demand. We have balanced income growth. We're starting the second half of  these lean inventories and we've got a fiscal stimulus coming through. It  all suggests the economy solid and will continue to grow at a solid base  here.</p><p>KEENE: The President with the tenth Tweet. I think he was going to do with  the 11th Twee this week. And the 11th Tweet, Mr. President, would have been  perfect. And that's the idea of the fiscal stimulus. How much is that  fiscal stimulus going to be? 0.5% of GDP? Do you have a number?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, we think in 2018 and '19, fiscal stimulus is adding about  0.5% per year. There's a little bit of it in the GDP report for the second  quarter both on spending --</p><p>KEENE: But a lot more to come?</p><p>KASMAN: But there's a lot more to come, particularly if the spending side  really does reach its peak if our estimates are right as we turn into 2019.  So we think the economy can probably hold growth at around 3% pace,  something we haven't done during this expansion for much time. And I think  that's a really good back draft in the sense that so far we haven't seen  late cycle pressure build, we haven't seen the fed move in any kind of  aggressive way. So there's nothing really preventing us from continuing to  January solid growth here at least for a little while.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Bruce, what do you worry about? Do  you worry about the fed having to like tight rates much more than expected  in 2019 or do you worry about something else?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the fed and late cycle dynamics in terms of the wage  pressure starting to put downward pressure on corporate margins is the  central risk of the expansion. I think the good news is it's moving very  slowly. On the immediate side, I think we do have to worry about whether  this trade war turns into war on trade. I mean, obviously we step back from  that last week with the E.U. meeting. But my concern would be that what's  happening here gives businesses a feeling that supply chain's broader trade  patterns are going to be affected permanently and begin to respond to that  in terms of sentiment in their spending.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. What do you wait to see whether that it can be at 3%? Is  there a danger that actually the U.S. economy is overheated? Are we there  again or we just not analyzing what some of the trade and tariffs could do?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think for the next six to nine months, the amount that  trade in tariffs is going to do to add to inflation is a pretty small  amount. I think the bigger question there is sentiment, whether it hurts  sentiment in a negative way. More broadly, I think we have tight labor  markets. I think we have in our future an overheated economy. I don't'  think it's there yet. I don't think the inflation number and the wage  numbers are pointing to that, and that's suggest this is going to move  pretty slowly. KEENE: I've got a controversial chart here. I want to bring it up and,  Bruce, this is about linking politics into your world of GDP forecasting,  which I think is baloney yet we do it every day. So what we've got here,  I'm going to make this bright red so you can see it, really, all. I'll get  this out on Bloomberg out on Twitter. This is the 20-year average here at  3.2%, the world's great. And then with the huge contraction that we had  early, Obama, you come in here down, and the President in this early years  has brought it up just a little bit as well. Within all of your experience,  I mean this President is off labors, boy, do they run and hide when it's  bad and they love to come out when it's good. But can you really link GDP  growth in the public policy?</p><p>KASMAN: Look, there is a fiscal stimulus working through this system and if  we want to champion that. And I wouldn't champion that at this point in the  cycle, it's adding to demand and it's supporting growth. But the broader  story that's improving growth here, which has a global dimension to it and  a domestic dimension, is something that has been growing for two to three  years as we're getting the benefits of very supportive monetary policy as  we're finally getting the healing in the post-financial crisis period come  through the system. So I think it would be a mistake at any point in time  to tie near term economic performance to immediate policy changes.</p><p>KEENE: We're thrilled to have you here at the start of the week with JP  Morgan, Bruce Kasman. He'll continue with us through the hour.</p><p>With us is Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan, and we're thrilled to bring you a  timely discussion and conversation with Chris Marangi. He is with the  Gabelli Funds, of course, on media and on all the infrastructure and things  that hold it together. I must touch on and Mr. Moonves' fate this week, it  is a cross all of the headlines, particularly here in New York City. How  important is Mr. Moonves to CBS for shareholders and investors?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Yes. Well, one of the interview  questions I give is do you buy asset or management given a choice. We had a  great situation at CBS where we had both. But ultimately, we want to buy  the asset and the assets are the same. Les has done a great job and he is  important to the story though.</p><p>KEENE: What do you do with CBS right now? Do you just wait out the soap  opera?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, yes, I think (inaudible) and we think about it as a 2x2  matrix. CBS, what's the value of CBS with Moonves without him, what's the  value of the combination of CBS and Viacom with Moonves, without him. The  answer is that CBS is worth more in all those cases, but the market has  increased a probability that we're going to be without Moonves.</p><p>KEENE: After what we've been through with Fox, Disney in all, there's been  all sorts of discussions of CBS combining almost on distribution reasons  with other networks, CNN mention and others as well. Is that they're  future, they've just got to find distribution?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, scale is critical in this business. You saw obviously  Comcast trying to achieve bigger scale with five since he's doing that  with. So I think eventually you'll see CBS a somebody else. I don't know  who will be that.</p><p>KEENE: You don't know how to be right, you don't want to inform us on a  Monday how many it would affect. Inform us on what that occurred last week.  We see a real dominance, a separation in technology of Google and Amazon  and others, Facebook and Twitter, disappointing shareholders? What's yours  and Mario's observation of that?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, what we learned last week is the fangs just don't go up all  the time. So, listen, Facebook said two bad words on their call. They  talked about deceleration and margin compression, and growth investors  don't want to see that. I think long-term is probably doing the right thing  for the stock. And The stock is basically back to where it was at the  beginning of the year. So we're not terribly distressed by it.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But, Chris, overall, and good morning from London,  what's your biggest concern when it comes to fanged stocks? Anyway, we're  not really leaving the bubble bursting in the year 2000, right? This is  different, and yet there are fault line.</p><p>MARANGI: It's clearly different than the late 90's early 2000's. Valuation  are rich. I don't think they're overly stretched for most member of the  fang. There are differences obviously between members of the fang. And as  Tom mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of a decoupling. I think,  frankly, Facebook's results make Google results look although much more  better because they did a terrific job of navigating some of the changes in  regulation and the concerns over privacy.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But what do you do with the snap? What do you do with  Twitter?</p><p>KASMAN: I think those are -- those don't quite have a scale. Obviously,  Twitter has been quite a platform. They helped the President quite a bit.  And their stocks have done well but obviously a lot of change there.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Chris, overall, I know we're also expecting Apple. I mean,  how do you take advantage of A.I.? If you look at the big trend in the next  5, 10, 15 years, do you go just for chipmakers in, for example, Asian  markets or do you go after some of these big tech stocks?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, I think one of the things that we like are recurring revenue  businesses. And the services business at Apple is growing a very attractive  part of that business. They have a global platform for music and  entertainment. So we like that aspect of stock. Obviously, it's cheap.  You've got Warren Buffet buying it.</p><p>KEENE: Here are the (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. The backdrop is Kasman's  optimism of JP Morgan economy. When you filter through earnings, which is  part of economics, when the corporate might get out there, what do you see  12 months more (ph)? Are you going to tell Marangi to shut up and load the  boat here on a Monday?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think what you're seeing a pretty healthy upturn in  corporate profits that's supported the macro fundamentals. I think what's  nice right now is we have a reasonably balanced income dynamic in the U.S.  and globally with employment growing close to a decade high and corporate  profits continuing to grow. We worry tight labor market will eventually  upset the apple cart by start to create a wedge between wages and  productivity, compressed margins, it's going to happen but it's not  happening now. KEENE: But to the savings revisions we saw in the GDP report, which to me  were the biggest thing in the report, Chris, people have the disposable  income to do media, don't they?</p><p>MARANGI: They do, but they're saving money by -- some are by are cutting  the cord and putting more -- keeping more money in their pockets.</p><p>KEENE: But the money they're utting accord is going to -- I would say,  suggest, it's going to other media sources, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's going to broad band, for example. Which is why we like  -- still like the cable stocks. Broad band plays as oppose to the view.</p><p>KEENE: So Comcast now has a screening value after the collapse since the  merge?</p><p>MARANGI: It was and it is even more valued today as a starter.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible ) overall, if you look at consolidation, I don't know  whether this is domestic, so it's U.S. or whether you lost possibility of  an outsider coming and buying some of the domestic players?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. So you've got obviously sprints which is still backed  Softbank and T-Mobile backed by Deutsche Telecom, trying to come together.  If that happens, I think it will be -- a lot of sense for them to buy an  infrastructure provider like charter, which will be the one for sale. I  don't think Comcast is for sales. So those would be two, if I had in the  past talk about LTs, of course, based on Europe has a business I the U.S.,  (inaudible) U.S. also being a consolidator. But they are, at the moment,  financially stressed and probably can't do anything.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce How are a lot of these deals going to be financed if they  come back to fruition? If it's almost the end of the era of cheap money,  does it impact actually cross border consolidation?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think right now, it's the end of the era of emergency  priced money. But if we look at U.S. policy rates being just at the rate of  inflation, if we look at an ECB that still has negative interest rates and  we have a BOJ which is isn't going to be moving the short rate any time  soon, I think it will be a mistake to say that we're having an issue here  with high interest rates and access to credit. I think we're at still a  pretty favorable environment for credit. And in fact, I think it's  improving in Europe and in the emerging markets compared to where we were  for most of the last three or four years. And I don't think credit and  interest rates are an obstacle here for deals or for the global economy to  move forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Bruce, thank you so much. Bruce Kasman there of JP  Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli funds both stay with us.</p><p>KEENE: Let me go to something Bruce Kasman has got his eye on and sort of  tangential. But on a Monday, we're struggling to find things to talk about.  I'm kidding. We've got Turkish lira up. We're doing this for a quick clear  off (ph) and in today chart in the Bloomberg, another leg up on the 24th of  July. And, again, it was just -- it's another EM (inaudible), Bruce Kasman.  And whether it's Turkish lira, Brazilian real, on and on, they're all  idiosyncratic until they're not. And you and I remember the third week of  August 1998 when we got to until they're not. How close are we until  they're not?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the point you're making is an important one, which is  we don't actually always see these interactions take place. But as we're  looking at the world right now, we don't see the big rise in global  interest rates. We see a big backdrop on growth that's pretty solid. We can  recognize that the Turkish story and the Brazilian story and the Argentine  story have very idiosyncratic elements to it. So we don't think this is  going to spill over. But I do think any time we're seeing the fed  tightening, any time we're seeing some stress points here, we have to worry  that there could be spillovers that were not appreciated.</p><p>KEENE: Is your call strong dollar? Does John Norman (ph) say, strong dollar  up?</p><p>KASMAN: No. Actually our call is that the dollar strength, given that the  trade story doesn't intensify that the dollar is actually going to weaken a  little bit in the second half of the year as we feel better about global  growth, particularly global growth outside the U.S. And we begin to see  some modest weakening in the dollar off of that.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, do you worry about the fact that despite tariffs and despite  trade, there seems to be a need (ph) from central banks to start  normalizing. Is it the right time worldwide in the economy to do so?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, again, I want to emphasize, the ECB is not going to be  raising rates for a year. The BOJ, even if it makes a tweak to a deal  controlled target today is not moving policy rates up. The amount of  tightening we're getting in global central banks is extremely small and  coming from very easy levels. I think the real question we're asking right  now is the fed that's moving steadily and is pushing up dollar interest  rates in a world in which dollar funding is very important, whether there's  a stress point on that, not whether not we're getting tight or it's really  mid (inaudible) tightening in financial conditions because of what central  banks are doing.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. But on the fed's -- Secretary Mnuchin suggested yesterday that  it's fine for the Federal Reserve to raise rates even if President Trump  attacks him. I mean, this is like a central bank's worst nightmare.</p><p>KASMAN: Well, there's definitely, I think, an issue around the independence  of the fed. But I think the fed is pretty insulated here and understands  what its role is. So we don't think the fed is going to be responding to  political pressure. We think the fed is a force and motion that's going to  move a quarter a percent each quarter here for a while. It's still got  another two or three moves at least to get back to neutral.</p><p>KEENE: Well, you've talked about the political forces that out there. And,  of course, Bruce Kasman, I know Chairman Powell is an enemy of the people.  Let's cover this with Chris Marangi right now of Gabelli Funds. The  President had a massive Tweet storm this weekend on the press. And, of  course, he went after the newspapers, Amazon, Washington Post in that. But  in your area, Chris, it's really about the power of cable news and the  whole dynamic that all of us are living every day. I mean, I've got my own  axe (ph) to grind in all that. But how do you, as an investors, perceive  the power of cable news into the election and particularly into the  presidential election of 2020?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, cable news is very powerful. It's a very valuable asset for  and very profitable asset for Fox, as well as for Comcast. Actually,  Comcast called out MSNBC, shows the other side of the spectrum is being a  strong driver for growth in a bad company. So they're gathering eyeballs  (ph) perhaps to the detriment of other forms of entertainment. We saw that  in the last election cycle. Maybe see it again now. But, again, very  profitable for those networks, very profitable for the broadcasters as  well.</p><p>KEENE: Can you find any value imprint? I mean, we see the uproar of the Los  Angeles Times. Remember (inaudible) used to be with Bloomberg. I should  mention, folks, going now to assist in that effort. But is there any value  for GAMCO (ph) and Gabelli in traditional print?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's very difficult to find (inaudible) companies these  days. So we have a pretty exposure with the Wall Street Journal with News  Corp (ph). And I think the Wall Street Journal is somewhat unique and  having -- been able to make the transition in part at least to digital.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, I don't know whether we're -- it's difficult, right, for  markets to understand the deep shifts that we're seeing culturally and in  our society. This feels like a big question that could be theoretical,  theological, whatever you want to call it, but how does it play out in the  markets five to ten years from now?</p><p>KASMAN: I think that's a really hard question to get our hands around. But  I think the point you're making is right. There are certain things  happening now, which are reflected in trade policy, reflected in political  outcomes. We're seeing reflected in events like Brexit which do, I think,  come out of accumulation of pressure points building over the last five or  ten years. And they're going to play out over the next five or ten years. I  don't have a clear crystal ball on how these things play out but we have a  demographic issue, we have slow underlying supply side performance. I think  there are pressure points here that are going to continue to build. And the  political implications of this are hard to see but they are, I think,  worrisome.</p><p>KEENE: Bruce Kasman with us and Chris Marangi as well, lots more to talk  about here in the hour.</p><p>LACQUA: Now, still with us, Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of  Gabelli Funds. Chris, when you look at, I guess, some of the big names out  there, I don't whether we're at the point where we say some of the just  won't survive, whether if you look at Snap or other ones and say, we don't  know how it creates values in four to five years, or do you assume that  they'll bought, repackaged and morph into something else?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I'm not sure if they'll be standalone entities. Scale, as I  mentioned this earlier, it is important to the media industry, it's  important to the internet industry as well. These companies thrive on data.  Data is contentious (ph). So I think John -- I would agree with John that  the cost of complying with privacy laws will go up, which will further  drive scale and probably consolidation in that industry.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, what does that -- yes. Chris, again, what does that mean for  actually the end consumer? What does it mean for regulation? Are you  assuming just more and more of it?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I think -- as I think one of the reasons that Facebook is  investing in the experience is, in fact, to head off or try to head off or  delay regulation because they have had -- companies like Facebook and  Twitter have had such a big impact on the political discourse in this  country and around the world.</p><p>KEENE: With our single best chart right now, Chris Marangi can weigh in on  this inflation just in real ten-year JGB in Japan. No, Bruce Kasman is  going to help us out. Chris, dive in here if you want. I'm fascinated by  the idea of you go from deflation to disinflation to actual tangible in  Japan, and one (inaudible) real rate. Here's the chart, down we go with a  long-term real rate decline in Japan. And we get some real improvement with  deflation. But then inflation comes in. And even if the yield comes up a  little, that inflation squeezes that real rate. What does that mean to the  people of Japan and to the banks?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I want to be careful here because all of the inflation that  we've seen in the last year in Japan is energy prices. If you strip that  out and you look at the core really --</p><p>KEENE: And your real rate is better than it is?</p><p>KASMAN: Yes. And I think what is very troubling in Japan right now is that  we have strong growth, we have a BOJ that's thinking about beginning to  make an adjustment away from a GL (ph) controlled policy. But underlying  inflation hasn't moved really anywhere closer to the BOJ's target and  market measures of inflation expectation are reflecting some loss or  credibility in the BOJ.</p><p>KEENE: Except that comment sounds a lot like Governor Carney a year ago,  nine months or whatever. And I understand the skills and amplitude are  different. But it seems like all of these central banks as we get the same  problem, they're rationalizing a higher space. And you're talking about  enthusiasm of GDP. But reality, Bruce, is the inflation just is not there,  is it?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think when you look at the inflation profile, there is a  modest but very modest upward trajectory that you see in most of the  developed world. I think what's unique about Japan is Japan is trying to  dig itself out of over two decades of deflationary psychology. And that  puts it in a very different place than what we're talking about the Bank of  England or the fed.</p><p>KEENE: And what you just said that is brilliant, I'm going to steal the  word from you all this week, is inflation profile, because inflation makeup  of each country, each culture is different. I mean, in almost -- Chris,  every industry has a different inflation profile. I mean, this is not a  cookie cutter central bank. There're some real nuances in these three  meetings, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, there is no doubt. And I think while the fed has an easy  (ph) meeting this week and the Bank of England has a tough call, which we  think they're going to take the step to tighten, the BOJ is by far, I  think, the most interesting one. Because what the BOJ is really struggling  with is actually missing its inflation objective and actually the last  reading is coming in low with a concern about financial stability of what  is you're doing in terms of squeezing out bank profitability</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, when you look at BOE, a lot of people are saying, look, they  may hike. But actually, when would you hike when the uncertainty of Brexit  is looming large, you have no idea of what kind of trade they'll do and you  don't have any idea at this point whether the U.K. will crash out of the  E.U. So why hike now? Is it a problem of credibility?</p><p>KASMAN: I think your point is a good one. You have all the Brexit  uncertainty still hanging over your head. But as a central bank, what  you're seeing is growth start to rebound after a hit over the last year.  You're seeing wages move higher. And you're really being frustrated by what  is still a very weak supply side productivity. Your policy rates are less  than 1%. So I think you're kind of balancing risks and leaning against it.  What the Bank of England is not doing is suggesting us that we've got a  significant rate hike path ahead but they are looking like they're willing  to take the step.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the single biggest mistake that a central bank can do now?  Is it tightening too soon or tightening too late?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the biggest mistake would be for the BOJ to tighten  right now because I think its credibility is at risk here. And we do have,  I think, the deep hole we're digging ourselves out of in terms of trying to  get the psychology right. I think if you look at the Bank of England, the  fed, these are issues which are right now more on the margin. Obviously,  there will be big issues down the road at some point.</p><p>KEENE: Chris Marangi with us right now. Compared (ph) to your research  notice or bargain, there're bargains out there, what shares, what sector of  shares can you acquire this morning?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, also we like the (inaudible). We talked about cable. The  cable stocks are around sale after Comcast's ill-fated bid for Fox</p><p>KEENE: And your cash flows are still persistent.</p><p>MARANGI: Cash flows are still terrific. It's all about broad band and the  shift on video to broad band. And that, I think, is finally being  recognized as the driver for that.</p><p>KEENE: Is the iPhone Bryan Roberts friend?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, long-term, 5G wireless will get more competitive with the  wire broad band product. But that's not something I worry about today. And  kind of just thinking about it, they're getting to the wireless business  themselves. I would think Netflix, contrary to some people's opinion, is  actually Comcast's friend because it drives broad band uptake (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Is YouTube TV of value?</p><p>MARANGI: YouTube TV is cheaper than the big bundle. You don't get quite as  much as you do in the big bundle. I think if you look at it on the breadth  of choice and the Claudia (ph) content, the bundle is still probably your  best bet if you've got a big family.</p><p>KEENE: Great. Chris, thank you so much for the briefing, particularly on  the (inaudible). Bruce Kasman, thank you. As always, I greatly appreciate  the Friday memo.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The President took a huge victory lap. Did he deserve to take it?</p><p>BRUCE KASMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Well not because I think the GDP report is the reflection of his policies, but I think we should feel good about what it tell us about the U.S. economy, looking through the headline number which is distorted by a couple of things, particularly trade. We have as a nice private sector recovery in demand. We have balanced income growth. We're starting the second half of these lean inventories and we've got a fiscal stimulus coming through. It all suggests the economy solid and will continue to grow at a solid base here.</p><p>KEENE: The President with the tenth Tweet. I think he was going to do with the 11th Twee this week. And the 11th Tweet, Mr. President, would have been perfect. And that's the idea of the fiscal stimulus. How much is that fiscal stimulus going to be? 0.5% of GDP? Do you have a number?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, we think in 2018 and `19, fiscal stimulus is adding about 0.5% per year. There's a little bit of it in the GDP report for the second quarter both on spending --</p><p>KEENE: But a lot more to come?</p><p>KASMAN: But there's a lot more to come, particularly if the spending side really does reach its peak if our estimates are right as we turn into 2019. So we think the economy can probably hold growth at around 3% pace, something we haven't done during this expansion for much time. And I think that's a really good back draft in the sense that so far we haven't seen late cycle pressure build, we haven't seen the fed move in any kind of aggressive way. So there's nothing really preventing us from continuing to January solid growth here at least for a little while.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Bruce, what do you worry about? Do you worry about the fed having to like tight rates much more than expected in 2019 or do you worry about something else?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the fed and late cycle dynamics in terms of the wage pressure starting to put downward pressure on corporate margins is the central risk of the expansion. I think the good news is it's moving very slowly. On the immediate side, I think we do have to worry about whether this trade war turns into war on trade. I mean, obviously we step back from that last week with the E.U. meeting. But my concern would be that what's happening here gives businesses a feeling that supply chain's broader trade patterns are going to be affected permanently and begin to respond to that in terms of sentiment in their spending.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. What do you wait to see whether that it can be at 3%? Is there a danger that actually the U.S. economy is overheated? Are we there again or we just not analyzing what some of the trade and tariffs could do?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think for the next six to nine months, the amount that trade in tariffs is going to do to add to inflation is a pretty small amount. I think the bigger question there is sentiment, whether it hurts sentiment in a negative way. More broadly, I think we have tight labor markets. I think we have in our future an overheated economy. I don't' think it's there yet. I don't think the inflation number and the wage numbers are pointing to that, and that's suggest this is going to move pretty slowly.</p><p>KEENE: I've got a controversial chart here. I want to bring it up and, Bruce, this is about linking politics into your world of GDP forecasting, which I think is baloney yet we do it every day. So what we've got here, I'm going to make this bright red so you can see it, really, all. I'll get this out on Bloomberg out on Twitter. This is the 20-year average here at 3.2%, the world's great. And then with the huge contraction that we had early, Obama, you come in here down, and the President in this early years has brought it up just a little bit as well. Within all of your experience, I mean this President is off labors, boy, do they run and hide when it's bad and they love to come out when it's good. But can you really link GDP growth in the public policy?</p><p>KASMAN: Look, there is a fiscal stimulus working through this system and if we want to champion that. And I wouldn't champion that at this point in the cycle, it's adding to demand and it's supporting growth. But the broader story that's improving growth here, which has a global dimension to it and a domestic dimension, is something that has been growing for two to three years as we're getting the benefits of very supportive monetary policy as we're finally getting the healing in the post-financial crisis period come through the system. So I think it would be a mistake at any point in time to tie near term economic performance to immediate policy changes.</p><p>KEENE: We're thrilled to have you here at the start of the week with JP Morgan, Bruce Kasman. He'll continue with us through the hour.</p><p>With us is Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan, and we're thrilled to bring you a timely discussion and conversation with Chris Marangi. He is with the Gabelli Funds, of course, on media and on all the infrastructure and things that hold it together. I must touch on and Mr. Moonves' fate this week, it is a cross all of the headlines, particularly here in New York City. How important is Mr. Moonves to CBS for shareholders and investors?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Yes. Well, one of the interview questions I give is do you buy asset or management given a choice. We had a great situation at CBS where we had both. But ultimately, we want to buy the asset and the assets are the same. Les has done a great job and he is important to the story though.</p><p>KEENE: What do you do with CBS right now? Do you just wait out the soap opera?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, yes, I think (inaudible) and we think about it as a 2x2 matrix. CBS, what's the value of CBS with Moonves without him, what's the value of the combination of CBS and Viacom with Moonves, without him. The answer is that CBS is worth more in all those cases, but the market has increased a probability that we're going to be without Moonves.</p><p>KEENE: After what we've been through with Fox, Disney in all, there's been all sorts of discussions of CBS combining almost on distribution reasons with other networks, CNN mention and others as well. Is that they're future, they've just got to find distribution?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, scale is critical in this business. You saw obviously Comcast trying to achieve bigger scale with five since he's doing that with. So I think eventually you'll see CBS a somebody else. I don't know who will be that.</p><p>KEENE: You don't know how to be right, you don't want to inform us on a Monday how many it would affect. Inform us on what that occurred last week. We see a real dominance, a separation in technology of Google and Amazon and others, Facebook and Twitter, disappointing shareholders? What's yours and Mario's observation of that?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, what we learned last week is the fangs just don't go up all the time. So, listen, Facebook said two bad words on their call. They talked about deceleration and margin compression, and growth investors don't want to see that. I think long-term is probably doing the right thing for the stock. And The stock is basically back to where it was at the beginning of the year. So we're not terribly distressed by it.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But, Chris, overall, and good morning from London, what's your biggest concern when it comes to fanged stocks? Anyway, we're not really leaving the bubble bursting in the year 2000, right? This is different, and yet there are fault line.</p><p>MARANGI: It's clearly different than the late 90's early 2000's. Valuation are rich. I don't think they're overly stretched for most member of the fang. There are differences obviously between members of the fang. And as Tom mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of a decoupling. I think, frankly, Facebook's results make Google results look although much more better because they did a terrific job of navigating some of the changes in regulation and the concerns over privacy.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. But what do you do with the snap? What do you do with Twitter?</p><p>KASMAN: I think those are -- those don't quite have a scale. Obviously, Twitter has been quite a platform. They helped the President quite a bit. And their stocks have done well but obviously a lot of change there.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Chris, overall, I know we're also expecting Apple. I mean, how do you take advantage of A.I.? If you look at the big trend in the next 5, 10, 15 years, do you go just for chipmakers in, for example, Asian markets or do you go after some of these big tech stocks?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, I think one of the things that we like are recurring revenue businesses. And the services business at Apple is growing a very attractive part of that business. They have a global platform for music and entertainment. So we like that aspect of stock. Obviously, it's cheap. You've got Warren Buffet buying it.</p><p>KEENE: Here are the (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. The backdrop is Kasman's optimism of JP Morgan economy. When you filter through earnings, which is part of economics, when the corporate might get out there, what do you see 12 months more (ph)? Are you going to tell Marangi to shut up and load the boat here on a Monday?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think what you're seeing a pretty healthy upturn in corporate profits that's supported the macro fundamentals. I think what's nice right now is we have a reasonably balanced income dynamic in the U.S. and globally with employment growing close to a decade high and corporate profits continuing to grow. We worry tight labor market will eventually upset the apple cart by start to create a wedge between wages and productivity, compressed margins, it's going to happen but it's not happening now.</p><p>KEENE: But to the savings revisions we saw in the GDP report, which to me were the biggest thing in the report, Chris, people have the disposable income to do media, don't they?</p><p>MARANGI: They do, but they're saving money by -- some are by are cutting the cord and putting more -- keeping more money in their pockets.</p><p>KEENE: But the money they're utting accord is going to -- I would say, suggest, it's going to other media sources, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's going to broad band, for example. Which is why we like -- still like the cable stocks. Broad band plays as oppose to the view.</p><p>KEENE: So Comcast now has a screening value after the collapse since the merge?</p><p>MARANGI: It was and it is even more valued today as a starter.</p><p>LACQUA: (Inaudible ) overall, if you look at consolidation, I don't know whether this is domestic, so it's U.S. or whether you lost possibility of an outsider coming and buying some of the domestic players?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. So you've got obviously sprints which is still backed Softbank and T-Mobile backed by Deutsche Telecom, trying to come together. If that happens, I think it will be -- a lot of sense for them to buy an infrastructure provider like charter, which will be the one for sale. I don't think Comcast is for sales. So those would be two, if I had in the past talk about LTs, of course, based on Europe has a business I the U.S., (inaudible) U.S. also being a consolidator. But they are, at the moment, financially stressed and probably can't do anything.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce How are a lot of these deals going to be financed if they come back to fruition? If it's almost the end of the era of cheap money, does it impact actually cross border consolidation?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think right now, it's the end of the era of emergency priced money. But if we look at U.S. policy rates being just at the rate of inflation, if we look at an ECB that still has negative interest rates and we have a BOJ which is isn't going to be moving the short rate any time soon, I think it will be a mistake to say that we're having an issue here with high interest rates and access to credit. I think we're at still a pretty favorable environment for credit. And in fact, I think it's improving in Europe and in the emerging markets compared to where we were for most of the last three or four years. And I don't think credit and interest rates are an obstacle here for deals or for the global economy to move forward.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Bruce, thank you so much. Bruce Kasman there of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli funds both stay with us.</p><p>KEENE: Let me go to something Bruce Kasman has got his eye on and sort of tangential. But on a Monday, we're struggling to find things to talk about. I'm kidding. We've got Turkish lira up. We're doing this for a quick clear off (ph) and in today chart in the Bloomberg, another leg up on the 24th of July. And, again, it was just -- it's another EM (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. And whether it's Turkish lira, Brazilian real, on and on, they're all idiosyncratic until they're not. And you and I remember the third week of August 1998 when we got to until they're not. How close are we until they're not?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the point you're making is an important one, which is we don't actually always see these interactions take place. But as we're looking at the world right now, we don't see the big rise in global interest rates. We see a big backdrop on growth that's pretty solid. We can recognize that the Turkish story and the Brazilian story and the Argentine story have very idiosyncratic elements to it. So we don't think this is going to spill over. But I do think any time we're seeing the fed tightening, any time we're seeing some stress points here, we have to worry that there could be spillovers that were not appreciated.</p><p>KEENE: Is your call strong dollar? Does John Norman (ph) say, strong dollar up?</p><p>KASMAN: No. Actually our call is that the dollar strength, given that the trade story doesn't intensify that the dollar is actually going to weaken a little bit in the second half of the year as we feel better about global growth, particularly global growth outside the U.S. And we begin to see some modest weakening in the dollar off of that.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, do you worry about the fact that despite tariffs and despite trade, there seems to be a need (ph) from central banks to start normalizing. Is it the right time worldwide in the economy to do so?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, again, I want to emphasize, the ECB is not going to be raising rates for a year. The BOJ, even if it makes a tweak to a deal controlled target today is not moving policy rates up. The amount of tightening we're getting in global central banks is extremely small and coming from very easy levels. I think the real question we're asking right now is the fed that's moving steadily and is pushing up dollar interest rates in a world in which dollar funding is very important, whether there's a stress point on that, not whether not we're getting tight or it's really mid (inaudible) tightening in financial conditions because of what central banks are doing.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. But on the fed's -- Secretary Mnuchin suggested yesterday that it's fine for the Federal Reserve to raise rates even if President Trump attacks him. I mean, this is like a central bank's worst nightmare.</p><p>KASMAN: Well, there's definitely, I think, an issue around the independence of the fed. But I think the fed is pretty insulated here and understands what its role is. So we don't think the fed is going to be responding to political pressure. We think the fed is a force and motion that's going to move a quarter a percent each quarter here for a while. It's still got another two or three moves at least to get back to neutral.</p><p>KEENE: Well, you've talked about the political forces that out there. And, of course, Bruce Kasman, I know Chairman Powell is an enemy of the people. Let's cover this with Chris Marangi right now of Gabelli Funds. The President had a massive Tweet storm this weekend on the press. And, of course, he went after the newspapers, Amazon, Washington Post in that. But in your area, Chris, it's really about the power of cable news and the whole dynamic that all of us are living every day. I mean, I've got my own axe (ph) to grind in all that. But how do you, as an investors, perceive the power of cable news into the election and particularly into the presidential election of 2020?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, cable news is very powerful. It's a very valuable asset for and very profitable asset for Fox, as well as for Comcast. Actually, Comcast called out MSNBC, shows the other side of the spectrum is being a strong driver for growth in a bad company. So they're gathering eyeballs (ph) perhaps to the detriment of other forms of entertainment. We saw that in the last election cycle. Maybe see it again now. But, again, very profitable for those networks, very profitable for the broadcasters as well.</p><p>KEENE: Can you find any value imprint? I mean, we see the uproar of the Los Angeles Times. Remember (inaudible) used to be with Bloomberg. I should mention, folks, going now to assist in that effort. But is there any value for GAMCO (ph) and Gabelli in traditional print?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, it's very difficult to find (inaudible) companies these days. So we have a pretty exposure with the Wall Street Journal with News Corp (ph). And I think the Wall Street Journal is somewhat unique and having -- been able to make the transition in part at least to digital.</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, I don't know whether we're -- it's difficult, right, for markets to understand the deep shifts that we're seeing culturally and in our society. This feels like a big question that could be theoretical, theological, whatever you want to call it, but how does it play out in the markets five to ten years from now?</p><p>KASMAN: I think that's a really hard question to get our hands around. But I think the point you're making is right. There are certain things happening now, which are reflected in trade policy, reflected in political outcomes. We're seeing reflected in events like Brexit which do, I think, come out of accumulation of pressure points building over the last five or ten years. And they're going to play out over the next five or ten years. I don't have a clear crystal ball on how these things play out but we have a demographic issue, we have slow underlying supply side performance. I think there are pressure points here that are going to continue to build. And the political implications of this are hard to see but they are, I think, worrisome.</p><p>KEENE: Bruce Kasman with us and Chris Marangi as well, lots more to talk about here in the hour.</p><p>LACQUA: Now, still with us, Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli Funds. Chris, when you look at, I guess, some of the big names out there, I don't whether we're at the point where we say some of the just won't survive, whether if you look at Snap or other ones and say, we don't know how it creates values in four to five years, or do you assume that they'll bought, repackaged and morph into something else?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I'm not sure if they'll be standalone entities. Scale, as I mentioned this earlier, it is important to the media industry, it's important to the internet industry as well. These companies thrive on data. Data is contentious (ph). So I think John -- I would agree with John that the cost of complying with privacy laws will go up, which will further drive scale and probably consolidation in that industry.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, what does that -- yes. Chris, again, what does that mean for actually the end consumer? What does it mean for regulation? Are you assuming just more and more of it?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. I think -- as I think one of the reasons that Facebook is investing in the experience is, in fact, to head off or try to head off or delay regulation because they have had -- companies like Facebook and Twitter have had such a big impact on the political discourse in this country and around the world.</p><p>KEENE: With our single best chart right now, Chris Marangi can weigh in on this inflation just in real ten-year JGB in Japan. No, Bruce Kasman is going to help us out. Chris, dive in here if you want. I'm fascinated by the idea of you go from deflation to disinflation to actual tangible in Japan, and one (inaudible) real rate. Here's the chart, down we go with a long-term real rate decline in Japan. And we get some real improvement with deflation. But then inflation comes in. And even if the yield comes up a little, that inflation squeezes that real rate. What does that mean to the people of Japan and to the banks?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I want to be careful here because all of the inflation that we've seen in the last year in Japan is energy prices. If you strip that out and you look at the core really --</p><p>KEENE: And your real rate is better than it is?</p><p>KASMAN: Yes. And I think what is very troubling in Japan right now is that we have strong growth, we have a BOJ that's thinking about beginning to make an adjustment away from a GL (ph) controlled policy. But underlying inflation hasn't moved really anywhere closer to the BOJ's target and market measures of inflation expectation are reflecting some loss or credibility in the BOJ.</p><p>KEENE: Except that comment sounds a lot like Governor Carney a year ago, nine months or whatever. And I understand the skills and amplitude are different. But it seems like all of these central banks as we get the same problem, they're rationalizing a higher space. And you're talking about enthusiasm of GDP. But reality, Bruce, is the inflation just is not there, is it?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think when you look at the inflation profile, there is a modest but very modest upward trajectory that you see in most of the developed world. I think what's unique about Japan is Japan is trying to dig itself out of over two decades of deflationary psychology. And that puts it in a very different place than what we're talking about the Bank of England or the fed.</p><p>KEENE: And what you just said that is brilliant, I'm going to steal the word from you all this week, is inflation profile, because inflation makeup of each country, each culture is different. I mean, in almost -- Chris, every industry has a different inflation profile. I mean, this is not a cookie cutter central bank. There're some real nuances in these three meetings, right?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, there is no doubt. And I think while the fed has an easy (ph) meeting this week and the Bank of England has a tough call, which we think they're going to take the step to tighten, the BOJ is by far, I think, the most interesting one. Because what the BOJ is really struggling with is actually missing its inflation objective and actually the last reading is coming in low with a concern about financial stability of what is you're doing in terms of squeezing out bank profitability</p><p>LACQUA: Bruce, when you look at BOE, a lot of people are saying, look, they may hike. But actually, when would you hike when the uncertainty of Brexit is looming large, you have no idea of what kind of trade they'll do and you don't have any idea at this point whether the U.K. will crash out of the E.U. So why hike now? Is it a problem of credibility?</p><p>KASMAN: I think your point is a good one. You have all the Brexit uncertainty still hanging over your head. But as a central bank, what you're seeing is growth start to rebound after a hit over the last year. You're seeing wages move higher. And you're really being frustrated by what is still a very weak supply side productivity. Your policy rates are less than 1%. So I think you're kind of balancing risks and leaning against it. What the Bank of England is not doing is suggesting us that we've got a significant rate hike path ahead but they are looking like they're willing to take the step.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the single biggest mistake that a central bank can do now? Is it tightening too soon or tightening too late?</p><p>KASMAN: Well, I think the biggest mistake would be for the BOJ to tighten right now because I think its credibility is at risk here. And we do have, I think, the deep hole we're digging ourselves out of in terms of trying to get the psychology right. I think if you look at the Bank of England, the fed, these are issues which are right now more on the margin. Obviously, there will be big issues down the road at some point.</p><p>KEENE: Chris Marangi with us right now. Compared (ph) to your research notice or bargain, there're bargains out there, what shares, what sector of shares can you acquire this morning?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, also we like the (inaudible). We talked about cable. The cable stocks are around sale after Comcast's ill-fated bid for Fox</p><p>KEENE: And your cash flows are still persistent.</p><p>MARANGI: Cash flows are still terrific. It's all about broad band and the shift on video to broad band. And that, I think, is finally being recognized as the driver for that.</p><p>KEENE: Is the iPhone Bryan Roberts friend?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, long-term, 5G wireless will get more competitive with the wire broad band product. But that's not something I worry about today. And kind of just thinking about it, they're getting to the wireless business themselves. I would think Netflix, contrary to some people's opinion, is actually Comcast's friend because it drives broad band uptake (ph).</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Is YouTube TV of value?</p><p>MARANGI: YouTube TV is cheaper than the big bundle. You don't get quite as much as you do in the big bundle. I think if you look at it on the breadth of choice and the Claudia (ph) content, the bundle is still probably your best bet if you've got a big family.</p><p>KEENE: Great. Chris, thank you so much for the briefing, particularly on the (inaudible). Bruce Kasman, thank you. As always, I greatly appreciate the Friday memo.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The President took a huge victory lap. Did he deserve to take it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well not because I think the GDP report is the reflection of his policies, but I think we should feel good about what it tell us about the U.S. economy, looking through the headline number which is distorted by a couple of things, particularly trade. We have as a nice private sector recovery in demand. We have balanced income growth. We're starting the second half of these lean inventories and we've got a fiscal stimulus coming through. It all suggests the economy solid and will continue to grow at a solid base here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  The President with the tenth Tweet. I think he was going to do with the 11th Twee this week. And the 11th Tweet, Mr. President, would have been perfect. And that's the idea of the fiscal stimulus. How much is that fiscal stimulus going to be? 0.5% of GDP? Do you have a number?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, we think in 2018 and '19, fiscal stimulus is adding about 0.5% per year. There's a little bit of it in the GDP report for the second quarter both on spending --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But a lot more to come?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  But there's a lot more to come, particularly if the spending side really does reach its peak if our estimates are right as we turn into 2019. So we think the economy can probably hold growth at around 3% pace, something we haven't done during this expansion for much time. And I think that's a really good back draft in the sense that so far we haven't seen late cycle pressure build, we haven't seen the fed move in any kind of aggressive way. So there's nothing really preventing us from continuing to January solid growth here at least for a little while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. Bruce, what do you worry about? Do you worry about the fed having to like tight rates much more than expected in 2019 or do you worry about something else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think the fed and late cycle dynamics in terms of the wage pressure starting to put downward pressure on corporate margins is the central risk of the expansion. I think the good news is it's moving very slowly. On the immediate side, I think we do have to worry about whether this trade war turns into war on trade. I mean, obviously we step back from that last week with the E.U. meeting. But my concern would be that what's happening here gives businesses a feeling that supply chain's broader trade patterns are going to be affected permanently and begin to respond to that in terms of sentiment in their spending.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. What do you wait to see whether that it can be at 3%? Is there a danger that actually the U.S. economy is overheated? Are we there again or we just not analyzing what some of the trade and tariffs could do?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think for the next six to nine months, the amount that trade in tariffs is going to do to add to inflation is a pretty small amount. I think the bigger question there is sentiment, whether it hurts sentiment in a negative way. More broadly, I think we have tight labor markets. I think we have in our future an overheated economy. I don't' think it's there yet. I don't think the inflation number and the wage numbers are pointing to that, and that's suggest this is going to move pretty slowly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I've got a controversial chart here. I want to bring it up and, Bruce, this is about linking politics into your world of GDP forecasting, which I think is baloney yet we do it every day. So what we've got here, I'm going to make this bright red so you can see it, really, all. I'll get this out on Bloomberg out on Twitter. This is the 20-year average here at 3.2%, the world's great. And then with the huge contraction that we had early, Obama, you come in here down, and the President in this early years has brought it up just a little bit as well. Within all of your experience, I mean this President is off labors, boy, do they run and hide when it's bad and they love to come out when it's good. But can you really link GDP growth in the public policy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Look, there is a fiscal stimulus working through this system and if we want to champion that. And I wouldn't champion that at this point in the cycle, it's adding to demand and it's supporting growth. But the broader story that's improving growth here, which has a global dimension to it and a domestic dimension, is something that has been growing for two to three years as we're getting the benefits of very supportive monetary policy as we're finally getting the healing in the post-financial crisis period come through the system. So I think it would be a mistake at any point in time to tie near term economic performance to immediate policy changes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We're thrilled to have you here at the start of the week with JP Morgan, Bruce Kasman. He'll continue with us through the hour.  </p><p>      With us is Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan, and we're thrilled to bring you a timely discussion and conversation with Chris Marangi. He is with the Gabelli Funds, of course, on media and on all the infrastructure and things that hold it together. I must touch on and Mr. Moonves' fate this week, it is a cross all of the headlines, particularly here in New York City. How important is Mr. Moonves to CBS for shareholders and investors?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, one of the interview questions I give is do you buy asset or management given a choice. We had a great situation at CBS where we had both. But ultimately, we want to buy the asset and the assets are the same. Les has done a great job and he is important to the story though.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  What do you do with CBS right now? Do you just wait out the soap opera?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, yes, I think (inaudible) and we think about it as a 2x2 matrix. CBS, what's the value of CBS with Moonves without him, what's the value of the combination of CBS and Viacom with Moonves, without him. The answer is that CBS is worth more in all those cases, but the market has increased a probability that we're going to be without Moonves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  After what we've been through with Fox, Disney in all, there's been all sorts of discussions of CBS combining almost on distribution reasons with other networks, CNN mention and others as well. Is that they're future, they've just got to find distribution?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, scale is critical in this business. You saw obviously Comcast trying to achieve bigger scale with five since he's doing that with. So I think eventually you'll see CBS a somebody else. I don't know who will be that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You don't know how to be right, you don't want to inform us on a Monday how many it would affect. Inform us on what that occurred last week. We see a real dominance, a separation in technology of Google and Amazon and others, Facebook and Twitter, disappointing shareholders? What's yours and Mario's observation of that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, what we learned last week is the fangs just don't go up all the time. So, listen, Facebook said two bad words on their call. They talked about deceleration and margin compression, and growth investors don't want to see that. I think long-term is probably doing the right thing for the stock. And The stock is basically back to where it was at the beginning of the year. So we're not terribly distressed by it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. But, Chris, overall, and good morning from London, what's your biggest concern when it comes to fanged stocks? Anyway, we're not really leaving the bubble bursting in the year 2000, right? This is different, and yet there are fault line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It's clearly different than the late 90's early 2000's. Valuation are rich. I don't think they're overly stretched for most member of the fang. There are differences obviously between members of the fang. And as Tom mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of a decoupling. I think, frankly, Facebook's results make Google results look although much more better because they did a terrific job of navigating some of the changes in regulation and the concerns over privacy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. But what do you do with the snap? What do you do with Twitter?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  I think those are -- those don't quite have a scale. Obviously, Twitter has been quite a platform. They helped the President quite a bit. And their stocks have done well but obviously a lot of change there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. Chris, overall, I know we're also expecting Apple. I mean, how do you take advantage of A.I.? If you look at the big trend in the next 5, 10, 15 years, do you go just for chipmakers in, for example, Asian markets or do you go after some of these big tech stocks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, I think one of the things that we like are recurring revenue businesses. And the services business at Apple is growing a very attractive part of that business. They have a global platform for music and entertainment. So we like that aspect of stock. Obviously, it's cheap. You've got Warren Buffet buying it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Here are the (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. The backdrop is Kasman's optimism of JP Morgan economy. When you filter through earnings, which is part of economics, when the corporate might get out there, what do you see 12 months more (ph)? Are you going to tell Marangi to shut up and load the boat here on a Monday?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think what you're seeing a pretty healthy upturn in corporate profits that's supported the macro fundamentals. I think what's nice right now is we have a reasonably balanced income dynamic in the U.S. and globally with employment growing close to a decade high and corporate profits continuing to grow. We worry tight labor market will eventually upset the apple cart by start to create a wedge between wages and productivity, compressed margins, it's going to happen but it's not happening now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But to the savings revisions we saw in the GDP report, which to me were the biggest thing in the report, Chris, people have the disposable income to do media, don't they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  They do, but they're saving money by -- some are by are cutting the cord and putting more -- keeping more money in their pockets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But the money they're utting accord is going to -- I would say, suggest, it's going to other media sources, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, it's going to broad band, for example. Which is why we like -- still like the cable stocks. Broad band plays as oppose to the view.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  So Comcast now has a screening value after the collapse since the merge?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It was and it is even more valued today as a starter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  (Inaudible ) overall, if you look at consolidation, I don't know whether this is domestic, so it's U.S. or whether you lost possibility of an outsider coming and buying some of the domestic players?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. So you've got obviously sprints which is still backed Softbank and T-Mobile backed by Deutsche Telecom, trying to come together. If that happens, I think it will be -- a lot of sense for them to buy an infrastructure provider like charter, which will be the one for sale. I don't think Comcast is for sales. So those would be two, if I had in the past talk about LTs, of course, based on Europe has a business I the U.S., (inaudible) U.S. also being a consolidator. But they are, at the moment, financially stressed and probably can't do anything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Bruce How are a lot of these deals going to be financed if they come back to fruition? If it's almost the end of the era of cheap money, does it impact actually cross border consolidation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think right now, it's the end of the era of emergency priced money. But if we look at U.S. policy rates being just at the rate of inflation, if we look at an ECB that still has negative interest rates and we have a BOJ which is isn't going to be moving the short rate any time soon, I think it will be a mistake to say that we're having an issue here with high interest rates and access to credit. I think we're at still a pretty favorable environment for credit. And in fact, I think it's improving in Europe and in the emerging markets compared to where we were for most of the last three or four years. And I don't think credit and interest rates are an obstacle here for deals or for the global economy to move forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. Bruce, thank you so much. Bruce Kasman there of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli funds both stay with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let me go to something Bruce Kasman has got his eye on and sort of tangential. But on a Monday, we're struggling to find things to talk about. I'm kidding. We've got Turkish lira up. We're doing this for a quick clear off (ph) and in today chart in the Bloomberg, another leg up on the 24th of July. And, again, it was just -- it's another EM (inaudible), Bruce Kasman. And whether it's Turkish lira, Brazilian real, on and on, they're all idiosyncratic until they're not. And you and I remember the third week of August 1998 when we got to until they're not. How close are we until they're not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think the point you're making is an important one, which is we don't actually always see these interactions take place. But as we're looking at the world right now, we don't see the big rise in global interest rates. We see a big backdrop on growth that's pretty solid. We can recognize that the Turkish story and the Brazilian story and the Argentine story have very idiosyncratic elements to it. So we don't think this is going to spill over. But I do think any time we're seeing the fed tightening, any time we're seeing some stress points here, we have to worry that there could be spillovers that were not appreciated.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is your call strong dollar? Does John Norman (ph) say, strong dollar up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  No. Actually our call is that the dollar strength, given that the trade story doesn't intensify that the dollar is actually going to weaken a little bit in the second half of the year as we feel better about global growth, particularly global growth outside the U.S. And we begin to see some modest weakening in the dollar off of that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Bruce, do you worry about the fact that despite tariffs and despite trade, there seems to be a need (ph) from central banks to start normalizing. Is it the right time worldwide in the economy to do so?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, again, I want to emphasize, the ECB is not going to be raising rates for a year. The BOJ, even if it makes a tweak to a deal controlled target today is not moving policy rates up. The amount of tightening we're getting in global central banks is extremely small and coming from very easy levels. I think the real question we're asking right now is the fed that's moving steadily and is pushing up dollar interest rates in a world in which dollar funding is very important, whether there's a stress point on that, not whether not we're getting tight or it's really mid (inaudible) tightening in financial conditions because of what central banks are doing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. But on the fed's -- Secretary Mnuchin suggested yesterday that it's fine for the Federal Reserve to raise rates even if President Trump attacks him. I mean, this is like a central bank's worst nightmare.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, there's definitely, I think, an issue around the independence of the fed. But I think the fed is pretty insulated here and understands what its role is. So we don't think the fed is going to be responding to political pressure. We think the fed is a force and motion that's going to move a quarter a percent each quarter here for a while. It's still got another two or three moves at least to get back to neutral.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, you've talked about the political forces that out there. And, of course, Bruce Kasman, I know Chairman Powell is an enemy of the people. Let's cover this with Chris Marangi right now of Gabelli Funds. The President had a massive Tweet storm this weekend on the press. And, of course, he went after the newspapers, Amazon, Washington Post in that. But in your area, Chris, it's really about the power of cable news and the whole dynamic that all of us are living every day. I mean, I've got my own axe (ph) to grind in all that. But how do you, as an investors, perceive the power of cable news into the election and particularly into the presidential election of 2020?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, cable news is very powerful. It's a very valuable asset for and very profitable asset for Fox, as well as for Comcast. Actually, Comcast called out MSNBC, shows the other side of the spectrum is being a strong driver for growth in a bad company. So they're gathering eyeballs (ph) perhaps to the detriment of other forms of entertainment. We saw that in the last election cycle. Maybe see it again now. But, again, very profitable for those networks, very profitable for the broadcasters as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Can you find any value imprint? I mean, we see the uproar of the Los Angeles Times. Remember (inaudible) used to be with Bloomberg. I should mention, folks, going now to assist in that effort. But is there any value for GAMCO (ph) and Gabelli in traditional print?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, it's very difficult to find (inaudible) companies these days. So we have a pretty exposure with the Wall Street Journal with News Corp (ph). And I think the Wall Street Journal is somewhat unique and having -- been able to make the transition in part at least to digital.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Bruce, I don't know whether we're -- it's difficult, right, for markets to understand the deep shifts that we're seeing culturally and in our society. This feels like a big question that could be theoretical, theological, whatever you want to call it, but how does it play out in the markets five to ten years from now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  I think that's a really hard question to get our hands around. But I think the point you're making is right. There are certain things happening now, which are reflected in trade policy, reflected in political outcomes. We're seeing reflected in events like Brexit which do, I think, come out of accumulation of pressure points building over the last five or ten years. And they're going to play out over the next five or ten years. I don't have a clear crystal ball on how these things play out but we have a demographic issue, we have slow underlying supply side performance. I think there are pressure points here that are going to continue to build. And the political implications of this are hard to see but they are, I think, worrisome.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Bruce Kasman with us and Chris Marangi as well, lots more to talk about here in the hour.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Now, still with us, Bruce Kasman of JP Morgan and Chris Marangi of Gabelli Funds. Chris, when you look at, I guess, some of the big names out there, I don't whether we're at the point where we say some of the just won't survive, whether if you look at Snap or other ones and say, we don't know how it creates values in four to five years, or do you assume that they'll bought, repackaged and morph into something else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. I'm not sure if they'll be standalone entities. Scale, as I mentioned this earlier, it is important to the media industry, it's important to the internet industry as well. These companies thrive on data. Data is contentious (ph). So I think John -- I would agree with John that the cost of complying with privacy laws will go up, which will further drive scale and probably consolidation in that industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Chris, what does that -- yes. Chris, again, what does that mean for actually the end consumer? What does it mean for regulation? Are you assuming just more and more of it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. I think -- as I think one of the reasons that Facebook is investing in the experience is, in fact, to head off or try to head off or delay regulation because they have had -- companies like Facebook and Twitter have had such a big impact on the political discourse in this country and around the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  With our single best chart right now, Chris Marangi can weigh in on this inflation just in real ten-year JGB in Japan. No, Bruce Kasman is going to help us out. Chris, dive in here if you want. I'm fascinated by the idea of you go from deflation to disinflation to actual tangible in Japan, and one (inaudible) real rate. Here's the chart, down we go with a long-term real rate decline in Japan. And we get some real improvement with deflation. But then inflation comes in. And even if the yield comes up a little, that inflation squeezes that real rate. What does that mean to the people of Japan and to the banks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I want to be careful here because all of the inflation that we've seen in the last year in Japan is energy prices. If you strip that out and you look at the core really --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And your real rate is better than it is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Yes. And I think what is very troubling in Japan right now is that we have strong growth, we have a BOJ that's thinking about beginning to make an adjustment away from a GL (ph) controlled policy. But underlying inflation hasn't moved really anywhere closer to the BOJ's target and market measures of inflation expectation are reflecting some loss or credibility in the BOJ.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Except that comment sounds a lot like Governor Carney a year ago, nine months or whatever. And I understand the skills and amplitude are different. But it seems like all of these central banks as we get the same problem, they're rationalizing a higher space. And you're talking about enthusiasm of GDP. But reality, Bruce, is the inflation just is not there, is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think when you look at the inflation profile, there is a modest but very modest upward trajectory that you see in most of the developed world. I think what's unique about Japan is Japan is trying to dig itself out of over two decades of deflationary psychology. And that puts it in a very different place than what we're talking about the Bank of England or the fed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And what you just said that is brilliant, I'm going to steal the word from you all this week, is inflation profile, because inflation makeup of each country, each culture is different. I mean, in almost -- Chris, every industry has a different inflation profile. I mean, this is not a cookie cutter central bank. There're some real nuances in these three meetings, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, there is no doubt. And I think while the fed has an easy (ph) meeting this week and the Bank of England has a tough call, which we think they're going to take the step to tighten, the BOJ is by far, I think, the most interesting one. Because what the BOJ is really struggling with is actually missing its inflation objective and actually the last reading is coming in low with a concern about financial stability of what is you're doing in terms of squeezing out bank profitability  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Bruce, when you look at BOE, a lot of people are saying, look, they may hike. But actually, when would you hike when the uncertainty of Brexit is looming large, you have no idea of what kind of trade they'll do and you don't have any idea at this point whether the U.K. will crash out of the E.U. So why hike now? Is it a problem of credibility?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  I think your point is a good one. You have all the Brexit uncertainty still hanging over your head. But as a central bank, what you're seeing is growth start to rebound after a hit over the last year. You're seeing wages move higher. And you're really being frustrated by what is still a very weak supply side productivity. Your policy rates are less than 1%. So I think you're kind of balancing risks and leaning against it. What the Bank of England is not doing is suggesting us that we've got a significant rate hike path ahead but they are looking like they're willing to take the step.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What is the single biggest mistake that a central bank can do now? Is it tightening too soon or tightening too late?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KASMAN</emphasis>:  Well, I think the biggest mistake would be for the BOJ to tighten right now because I think its credibility is at risk here. And we do have, I think, the deep hole we're digging ourselves out of in terms of trying to get the psychology right. I think if you look at the Bank of England, the fed, these are issues which are right now more on the margin. Obviously, there will be big issues down the road at some point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Chris Marangi with us right now. Compared (ph) to your research notice or bargain, there're bargains out there, what shares, what sector of shares can you acquire this morning?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, also we like the (inaudible). We talked about cable. The cable stocks are around sale after Comcast's ill-fated bid for Fox  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And your cash flows are still persistent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Cash flows are still terrific. It's all about broad band and the shift on video to broad band. And that, I think, is finally being recognized as the driver for that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Is the iPhone Bryan Roberts friend?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, long-term, 5G wireless will get more competitive with the wire broad band product. But that's not something I worry about today. And kind of just thinking about it, they're getting to the wireless business themselves. I would think Netflix, contrary to some people's opinion, is actually Comcast's friend because it drives broad band uptake (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. Is YouTube TV of value?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  YouTube TV is cheaper than the big bundle. You don't get quite as much as you do in the big bundle. I think if you look at it on the breadth of choice and the Claudia (ph) content, the bundle is still probably your best bet if you've got a big family.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Great. Chris, thank you so much for the briefing, particularly on the (inaudible). Bruce Kasman, thank you. As always, I greatly appreciate the Friday memo.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXS-GBV1-F15W-H187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">09:14</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BETTY LIU, BLOOMBERG NEWS ANCHOR: I want to bring in two houses in the investment world here with me. <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner </nameText></person>is the Chairman and also Principal at GTCR, which just closed a new $3.25 billion buyout fund called Fund X (ph).</p><p>Also with me J.B. Pritzker, who is the Founder of New World Ventures, which invests mostly in young technology companies here in Chicago. One big tech company that we know about, of course, is Groupon, which we'll talk about in a moment.</p><p>Now, for you, two, and by the way, thanks so much for joining us here.</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE RAUNER, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, GTCR: Thank (ph) you.</p><p>LIU: For the both of you, has it gotten a lot harder to find companies to put your money in?</p><p>RAUNER: The answer is, yes. The markets are more and more efficient every year in the private equity, in the venture capital world, more competitive. But the reality is innovation and entrepreneurship is alive and thriving in the United States.</p><p>And there are a lot of good opportunities.</p><p>J.B. PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES: Strangely, some of the best companies in the startup world are created in recessions. Google's a great example of that. Groupon is a good example of that.</p><p>And so at least in the venture capital world, there has been quite a lot of activity. It's booming. You see that in the IPO market now.</p><p>LIU: Right.</p><p>PRITZKER: And companies that were just created a few years ago.</p><p>LIU: So are you finding more startup investments?</p><p>PRITZKER: We are. There are an awful lot more people that are interested in looking at investing in startups even at the earliest stages.</p><p>LIU: Valuations?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, they're lofty. And I think that's true across the entire spectrum of private equity and venture capital.</p><p>And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings.</p><p>But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know, risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in head first.</p><p>LIU: At this point.</p><p>Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar, they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.</p><p>RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture capital world is relatively flush with money.</p><p>And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high.</p><p>LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly?</p><p>RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very flush with capital...</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public markets, in the stock market.</p><p>But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research, I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama administration, the White House has been hostile to business.</p><p>Why does that matter to you?</p><p>RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes, coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.</p><p>And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that track.</p><p>LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that?</p><p>RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've got to change that.</p><p>LIU: What about for you?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that. You know, a lot of that discussion doesn't really impact it. You're talking about, you know, at the earliest stages, one, two, three-person companies. They aren't affected by the discussion about regulation, unions, et cetera.</p><p>And so what they are affected by is capital availability. And right now, in the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready.</p><p>And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not available. And the banks aren't loaning.</p><p>LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers, essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know.</p><p>RAUNER: That's true.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, thank you so much.</p><p>And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more about the money management world. We're going to be back with <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner </nameText></person>and J.B. Pritzker in just a few moments, live here from Chicago.</p><p>09:18</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>09:23</p><p>LIU: We are back with our two guests here, <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner, </nameText></person>the Chairman and Principal at GTCR, the private equity firm, also J.B. Pritzker with us as well, the Founder of New World Ventures.</p><p>I want to stay with technology for a moment, J.B. Did you invest in Groupon? You did invest, right?</p><p>PRITZKER: We did not.</p><p>LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together. It's a very young company. But it is, you know, a rocket to the stars...</p><p>LIU: But did they approach you at some point?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, later on when they were in their later stages. We're an early stage IT investment firm.</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>PRITZKER: So we weren't interested in kind of the multi-billion dollar valuations. But look, it's going to be a terrific IPO and a great thing for Chicago.</p><p>LIU: Well, I was going to say, I mean, the fame that Groupon has generated, you know, for the social media companies, you know, in the coupon space, how has that changed? Or has that been a game changer at all here in Chicago?</p><p>PRITZKER: It has. Look, I think Groupon is a symptom of something going on in Chicago right now which is we've created the foundation here for an unbelievably, you know, elaborate and well put together underpinning for a technology ecosystem.</p><p>So entrepreneurs that are starting businesses here had capital available to them. They've got talent available to them at our terrific institutions UFI (ph). You have seen Northwestern and IIT (ph).</p><p>So Chicago is really going to end up a center of technology. And Groupon is, again, it's going to be a great IPO. But just behind that are companies like GrubHub and Sittercity and other big companies that you're going to hear about.</p><p>LIU: Are those some of your companies?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, Sittercity is one.</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>Bruce, talking about IPOs, we've seen quite a few private equity firms come out into the public market. Would you ever consider that?</p><p>RAUNER: I don't think it would be right for our firm. And in general, I think private equity or venture capital firms that are focused on a particular strategy aren't very good public companies. They're too volatile and too unpredictable. The firms that have...</p><p>LIU: Well, you know a lot of these talks go (ph) down. I mean, it works it (ph) down with 70 percent.</p><p>RAUNER: We're in a very, very cyclical business in private equity investing. And the reality is the firms that have gone public, we'll see how their stocks do. But they've very much change and diversified. They're broad-asset management firms.</p><p>They're in mezzanine. They're in real estate. They're in M&amp;A advisory works. So they have very diversified financial services.</p><p>LIU: But if you stay private, are you going to have any trouble retaining talent at all?</p><p>RAUNER: Not at all. Frankly, I think it's easier to retain talent as a private firm because we can be flexible on the compensations with our people.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, J.B., thank you so much. Really appreciate you staying with us and talking about...</p><p>PRITZKER (ph): Thank you.</p><p>LIU: ...all things technology and what's going on in the private equity world.</p><p>09:26</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 09:14</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  BETTY LIU, BLOOMBERG NEWS ANCHOR: I want to bring in two houses in the  investment world here with me. Bruce Rauner is the Chairman and also  Principal at GTCR, which just closed a new $3.25 billion buyout fund called  Fund X (ph). </p><p>  Also with me J.B. Pritzker, who is the Founder of New World Ventures,  which invests mostly in young technology companies here in Chicago. One big  tech company that we know about, of course, is Groupon, which we'll talk  about in a moment.   </p><p>  Now, for you, two, and by the way, thanks so much for joining us here.</p><p>  BRUCE RAUNER, CHAIRMAN, GTCR: Thank (ph) you.</p><p>  LIU: For the both of you, has it gotten a lot harder to find companies  to put your money in? </p><p>  RAUNER: The answer is, yes. The markets are more and more efficient  every year in the private equity, in the venture capital world, more  competitive. But the reality is innovation and entrepreneurship is alive  and thriving in the United States. </p><p>  And there are a lot of good opportunities.   </p><p>  J.B. PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES: Strangely, some of the  best companies in the startup world are created in recessions. Google's a  great example of that. Groupon is a good example of that. </p><p> And so at least in the venture capital world, there has been quite a lot of  activity. It's booming. You see that in the IPO market now.</p><p> LIU: Right. </p><p> PRITZKER: And companies that were just created a few years ago.  </p><p>  LIU: So are you finding more startup investments?</p><p> PRITZKER: We are. There are an awful lot more people that are interested in  looking at investing in startups even at the earliest stages. </p><p> LIU: Valuations? </p><p> PRITZKER: Well, they're lofty. And I think that's true across the entire  spectrum of private equity and venture capital. </p><p> And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why  there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms  going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings. </p><p> But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know,  risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these  outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in  head first.   </p><p>  LIU: At this point. </p><p> Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I  mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar,  they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.   </p><p>  RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital  out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across  the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture  capital world is relatively flush with money. </p><p> And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high. </p><p>  LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly? </p><p>  RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very  flush with capital...</p><p> LIU: OK. </p><p> RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that  potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't  find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public  markets, in the stock market.</p><p> But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then  private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts. </p><p>  LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research,  I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama  administration, the White House has been hostile to business.   </p><p> Why does that matter to you? </p><p>  RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a  standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes,  coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.   </p><p> And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that  track.   </p><p>  LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in  yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of  stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that? </p><p>  RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our  attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've  got to change that.   </p><p> LIU: What about for you?</p><p> PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that. You  know, a lot of that discussion doesn't really impact it. You're talking  about, you know, at the earliest stages, one, two, three-person companies.  They aren't affected by the discussion about regulation, unions, et cetera. </p><p> And so what they are affected by is capital availability. And right now, in  the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the  case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready. </p><p> And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small  business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not  available. And the banks aren't loaning. </p><p>  LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the  banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers,  essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know. </p><p> RAUNER: That's true. </p><p> LIU: Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p> And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more  about the money management world. We're going to be back with Bruce Rauner  and J.B. Pritzker in just a few moments, live here from Chicago.</p><p> 09:18</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 09:23</p><p> LIU: We are back with our two guests here, Bruce Rauner, the Chairman and  Principal at GTCR, the private equity firm, also J.B. Pritzker with us as  well, the Founder of New World Ventures. </p><p> I want to stay with technology for a moment, J.B. Did you invest in  Groupon? You did invest, right? </p><p>  PRITZKER: We did not.   </p><p>  LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing? </p><p>  PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created  it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together.  It's a very young company. But it is, you know, a rocket to the stars...</p><p>  LIU: But did they approach you at some point? </p><p>  PRITZKER: Yes, later on when they were in their later stages. We're an  early stage IT investment firm. </p><p> LIU: OK. </p><p> PRITZKER: So we weren't interested in kind of the multi-billion dollar  valuations. But look, it's going to be a terrific IPO and a great thing for  Chicago.   </p><p>  LIU: Well, I was going to say, I mean, the fame that Groupon has  generated, you know, for the social media companies, you know, in the  coupon space, how has that changed? Or has that been a game changer at all  here in Chicago? </p><p>  PRITZKER: It has. Look, I think Groupon is a symptom of something  going on in Chicago right now which is we've created the foundation here  for an unbelievably, you know, elaborate and well put together underpinning  for a technology ecosystem.   </p><p> So entrepreneurs that are starting businesses here had capital available to  them. They've got talent available to them at our terrific institutions UFI  (ph). You have seen Northwestern and IIT (ph). </p><p> So Chicago is really going to end up a center of technology. And Groupon  is, again, it's going to be a great IPO. But just behind that are companies  like GrubHub and Sittercity and other big companies that you're going to  hear about.</p><p>  LIU: Are those some of your companies?</p><p>  PRITZKER: Yes, Sittercity is one. </p><p> LIU: OK. </p><p> Bruce, talking about IPOs, we've seen quite a few private equity firms come  out into the public market. Would you ever consider that? </p><p> RAUNER: I don't think it would be right for our firm. And in general, I  think private equity or venture capital firms that are focused on a  particular strategy aren't very good public companies. They're too volatile  and too unpredictable. The firms that have...</p><p> LIU: Well, you know a lot of these talks go (ph) down. I mean, it works it  (ph) down with 70 percent. </p><p> RAUNER: We're in a very, very cyclical business in private equity  investing. And the reality is the firms that have gone public, we'll see  how their stocks do. But they've very much change and diversified. They're  broad-asset management firms.</p><p> They're in mezzanine. They're in real estate. They're in M&amp;A advisory  works. So they have very diversified financial services.   </p><p>  LIU: But if you stay private, are you going to have any trouble  retaining talent at all? </p><p>  RAUNER: Not at all. Frankly, I think it's easier to retain talent as a  private firm because we can be flexible on the compensations with our  people.   </p><p> LIU: Bruce, J.B., thank you so much. Really appreciate you staying with us  and talking about...</p><p> PRITZKER (ph):  Thank you.</p><p> LIU: ...all things technology and what's going on in the private equity  world.   </p><p> 09:26</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The markets are more and more efficient every year in the private equity, in the venture capital world, more competitive. But the reality is innovation and entrepreneurship is alive and thriving in the United States.</p><p>And there are a lot of good opportunities.</p><p>J.B. PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES: Strangely, some of the best companies in the startup world are created in recessions. Google's a great example of that. Groupon is a good example of that.</p><p>And so at least in the venture capital world, there has been quite a lot of activity. It's booming. You see that in the IPO market now.</p><p>LIU: Right.</p><p>PRITZKER: And companies that were just created a few years ago.</p><p>LIU: So are you finding more startup investments?</p><p>PRITZKER: We are. There are an awful lot more people that are interested in looking at investing in startups even at the earliest stages.</p><p>LIU: Valuations?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, they're lofty. And I think that's true across the entire spectrum of private equity and venture capital.</p><p>And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings.</p><p>But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know, risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in head first.</p><p>LIU: At this point.</p><p>Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar, they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.</p><p>RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture capital world is relatively flush with money.</p><p>And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high.</p><p>LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly?</p><p>RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very flush with capital...</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public markets, in the stock market.</p><p>But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research, I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama administration, the White House has been hostile to business.</p><p>Why does that matter to you?</p><p>RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes, coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.</p><p>And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that track.</p><p>LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that?</p><p>RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've got to change that.</p><p>LIU: What about for you?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that. You know, a lot of that discussion doesn't really impact it. You're talking about, you know, at the earliest stages, one, two, three-person companies. They aren't affected by the discussion about regulation, unions, et cetera.</p><p>And so what they are affected by is capital availability. And right now, in the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready.</p><p>And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not available. And the banks aren't loaning.</p><p>LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers, essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know.</p><p>RAUNER: That's true.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, thank you so much.</p><p>And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more about the money management world. We're going to be back with <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner </nameText></person>and J.B. Pritzker in just a few moments, live here from Chicago.</p><p>09:18</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>09:23</p><p>LIU: We are back with our two guests here, <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner, </nameText></person>the Chairman and Principal at GTCR, the private equity firm, also J.B. Pritzker with us as well, the Founder of New World Ventures.</p><p>I want to stay with technology for a moment, J.B. Did you invest in Groupon? You did invest, right?</p><p>PRITZKER: We did not.</p><p>LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together. It's a very young company. But it is, you know, a rocket to the stars...</p><p>LIU: But did they approach you at some point?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, later on when they were in their later stages. We're an early stage IT investment firm.</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>PRITZKER: So we weren't interested in kind of the multi-billion dollar valuations. But look, it's going to be a terrific IPO and a great thing for Chicago.</p><p>LIU: Well, I was going to say, I mean, the fame that Groupon has generated, you know, for the social media companies, you know, in the coupon space, how has that changed? Or has that been a game changer at all here in Chicago?</p><p>PRITZKER: It has. Look, I think Groupon is a symptom of something going on in Chicago right now which is we've created the foundation here for an unbelievably, you know, elaborate and well put together underpinning for a technology ecosystem.</p><p>So entrepreneurs that are starting businesses here had capital available to them. They've got talent available to them at our terrific institutions UFI (ph). You have seen Northwestern and IIT (ph).</p><p>So Chicago is really going to end up a center of technology. And Groupon is, again, it's going to be a great IPO. But just behind that are companies like GrubHub and Sittercity and other big companies that you're going to hear about.</p><p>LIU: Are those some of your companies?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, Sittercity is one.</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>Bruce, talking about IPOs, we've seen quite a few private equity firms come out into the public market. Would you ever consider that?</p><p>RAUNER: I don't think it would be right for our firm. And in general, I think private equity or venture capital firms that are focused on a particular strategy aren't very good public companies. They're too volatile and too unpredictable. The firms that have...</p><p>LIU: Well, you know a lot of these talks go (ph) down. I mean, it works it (ph) down with 70 percent.</p><p>RAUNER: We're in a very, very cyclical business in private equity investing. And the reality is the firms that have gone public, we'll see how their stocks do. But they've very much change and diversified. They're broad-asset management firms.</p><p>They're in mezzanine. They're in real estate. They're in M&amp;A advisory works. So they have very diversified financial services.</p><p>LIU: But if you stay private, are you going to have any trouble retaining talent at all?</p><p>RAUNER: Not at all. Frankly, I think it's easier to retain talent as a private firm because we can be flexible on the compensations with our people.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, J.B., thank you so much. Really appreciate you staying with us and talking about...</p><p>PRITZKER (ph): Thank you.</p><p>LIU: ...all things technology and what's going on in the private equity world.</p><p>09:26</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And I think that's true across the entire  spectrum of private equity and venture capital. </p><p>And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why  there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms  going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings. </p><p>But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know,  risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these  outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in  head first.   </p><p>LIU: At this point. </p><p>Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I  mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar,  they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.   </p><p>RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital  out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across  the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture  capital world is relatively flush with money. </p><p>And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high. </p><p>LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly? </p><p>RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very  flush with capital...</p><p>LIU: OK. </p><p>RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that  potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't  find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public  markets, in the stock market.</p><p>But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then  private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts. </p><p>LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research,  I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama  administration, the White House has been hostile to business.   </p><p>Why does that matter to you? </p><p>RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a  standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes,  coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.   </p><p>And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that  track.   </p><p>LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in  yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of  stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that? </p><p>RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our  attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've  got to change that.   </p><p>LIU: What about for you?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that. You  know, a lot of that discussion doesn't really impact it. You're talking  about, you know, at the earliest stages, one, two, three-person companies.  They aren't affected by the discussion about regulation, unions, et cetera. </p><p>And so what they are affected by is capital availability. And right now, in  the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the  case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready. </p><p>And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small  business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not  available. And the banks aren't loaning. </p><p>LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the  banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers,  essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know. </p><p>RAUNER: That's true. </p><p>LIU: Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p>And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more  about the money management world. We're going to be back with Bruce Rauner  and J.B. Pritzker in just a few moments, live here from Chicago.</p><p>09:18</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>09:23</p><p>LIU: We are back with our two guests here, Bruce Rauner, the Chairman and  Principal at GTCR, the private equity firm, also J.B. Pritzker with us as  well, the Founder of New World Ventures. </p><p>I want to stay with technology for a moment, J.B. Did you invest in  Groupon? You did invest, right? </p><p>PRITZKER: We did not.   </p><p>LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing? </p><p>PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created  it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together.  It's a very young company. But it is, you know, a rocket to the stars...</p><p>LIU: But did they approach you at some point? </p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, later on when they were in their later stages. We're an  early stage IT investment firm. </p><p>LIU: OK. </p><p>PRITZKER: So we weren't interested in kind of the multi-billion dollar  valuations. But look, it's going to be a terrific IPO and a great thing for  Chicago.   </p><p>LIU: Well, I was going to say, I mean, the fame that Groupon has  generated, you know, for the social media companies, you know, in the  coupon space, how has that changed? Or has that been a game changer at all  here in Chicago? </p><p>PRITZKER: It has. Look, I think Groupon is a symptom of something  going on in Chicago right now which is we've created the foundation here  for an unbelievably, you know, elaborate and well put together underpinning  for a technology ecosystem.   </p><p>So entrepreneurs that are starting businesses here had capital available to  them. They've got talent available to them at our terrific institutions UFI  (ph). You have seen Northwestern and IIT (ph). </p><p>So Chicago is really going to end up a center of technology. And Groupon  is, again, it's going to be a great IPO. But just behind that are companies  like GrubHub and Sittercity and other big companies that you're going to  hear about.</p><p>LIU: Are those some of your companies?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, Sittercity is one. </p><p>LIU: OK. </p><p>Bruce, talking about IPOs, we've seen quite a few private equity firms come  out into the public market. Would you ever consider that? </p><p>RAUNER: I don't think it would be right for our firm. And in general, I  think private equity or venture capital firms that are focused on a  particular strategy aren't very good public companies. They're too volatile  and too unpredictable. The firms that have...</p><p>LIU: Well, you know a lot of these talks go (ph) down. I mean, it works it  (ph) down with 70 percent. </p><p>RAUNER: We're in a very, very cyclical business in private equity  investing. And the reality is the firms that have gone public, we'll see  how their stocks do. But they've very much change and diversified. They're  broad-asset management firms.</p><p>They're in mezzanine. They're in real estate. They're in M&amp;A advisory  works. So they have very diversified financial services.   </p><p>LIU: But if you stay private, are you going to have any trouble  retaining talent at all? </p><p>RAUNER: Not at all. Frankly, I think it's easier to retain talent as a  private firm because we can be flexible on the compensations with our  people.   </p><p>LIU: Bruce, J.B., thank you so much. Really appreciate you staying with us  and talking about...</p><p>PRITZKER (ph):  Thank you.</p><p>LIU: ...all things technology and what's going on in the private equity  world.   </p><p>09:26</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 09:14</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  BETTY LIU, BLOOMBERG NEWS ANCHOR: I want to bring in two houses in the  investment world here with me. Bruce Rauner is the Chairman and also  Principal at GTCR, which just closed a new $3.25 billion buyout fund called  Fund X (ph). </p><p>  Also with me J.B. Pritzker, who is the Founder of New World Ventures,  which invests mostly in young technology companies here in Chicago. One big  tech company that we know about, of course, is Groupon, which we'll talk  about in a moment.   </p><p>  Now, for you, two, and by the way, thanks so much for joining us here.</p><p>  BRUCE RAUNER, CHAIRMAN, GTCR: Thank (ph) you.</p><p>  LIU: For the both of you, has it gotten a lot harder to find companies  to put your money in? </p><p>  RAUNER: The answer is, yes. The markets are more and more efficient  every year in the private equity, in the venture capital world, more  competitive. But the reality is innovation and entrepreneurship is alive  and thriving in the United States. </p><p>  And there are a lot of good opportunities.   </p><p>  J.B. PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES: Strangely, some of the  best companies in the startup world are created in recessions. Google's a  great example of that. Groupon is a good example of that. </p><p> And so at least in the venture capital world, there has been quite a lot of  activity. It's booming. You see that in the IPO market now.</p><p> LIU: Right. </p><p> PRITZKER: And companies that were just created a few years ago.  </p><p>  LIU: So are you finding more startup investments?</p><p> PRITZKER: We are. There are an awful lot more people that are interested in  looking at investing in startups even at the earliest stages. </p><p> LIU: Valuations? </p><p> PRITZKER: Well, they're lofty. And I think that's true across the entire  spectrum of private equity and venture capital. </p><p> And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why  there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms  going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings. </p><p> But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know,  risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these  outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in  head first.   </p><p>  LIU: At this point. </p><p> Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I  mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar,  they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.   </p><p>  RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital  out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across  the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture  capital world is relatively flush with money. </p><p> And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high. </p><p>  LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly? </p><p>  RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very  flush with capital...</p><p> LIU: OK. </p><p> RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that  potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't  find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public  markets, in the stock market.</p><p> But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then  private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts. </p><p>  LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research,  I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama  administration, the White House has been hostile to business.   </p><p> Why does that matter to you? </p><p>  RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a  standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes,  coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.   </p><p> And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that  track.   </p><p>  LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in  yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of  stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that? </p><p>  RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our  attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've  got to change that.   </p><p> LIU: What about for you?</p><p> PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that.

And right now, in  the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the  case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready. </p><p> And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small  business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not  available. And the banks aren't loaning. </p><p>  LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the  banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers,  essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know. </p><p> RAUNER: That's true. </p><p> LIU: Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p> And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more  about the money management world. We're going to be back with Bruce Rauner  and J.B.

You did invest, right? </p><p>  PRITZKER: We did not.   </p><p>  LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing? </p><p>  PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created  it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together.  It's a very young company.

Pritzker, who is the Founder of New World Ventures, which invests mostly in young technology companies here in Chicago. One big tech company that we know about, of course, is Groupon, which we'll talk about in a moment.</p><p>Now, for you, two, and by the way, thanks so much for joining us here.</p><p><person><nameText>BRUCE RAUNER, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, GTCR: Thank (ph) you.</p><p>LIU: For the both of you, has it gotten a lot harder to find companies to put your money in?</p><p>RAUNER: The answer is, yes. The markets are more and more efficient every year in the private equity, in the venture capital world, more competitive. But the reality is innovation and entrepreneurship is alive and thriving in the United States.</p><p>And there are a lot of good opportunities.</p><p>J.B. PRITZKER, FOUNDER, NEW WORLD VENTURES: Strangely, some of the best companies in the startup world are created in recessions. Google's a great example of that. Groupon is a good example of that.</p><p>And so at least in the venture capital world, there has been quite a lot of activity. It's booming. You see that in the IPO market now.</p><p>LIU: Right.</p><p>PRITZKER: And companies that were just created a few years ago.</p><p>LIU: So are you finding more startup investments?</p><p>PRITZKER: We are. There are an awful lot more people that are interested in looking at investing in startups even at the earliest stages.</p><p>LIU: Valuations?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, they're lofty. And I think that's true across the entire spectrum of private equity and venture capital.</p><p>And I can't really explain why there are probably macroeconomic reasons why there's certainly a lot of lending that's available to private equity firms going in and buying companies and stable (ph) financings.</p><p>But in the venture world, I think there's a desire to look for, you know, risk reward that makes sense. And in the venture world, you can see these outsize returns at this point in the cycle. So I think people are diving in head first.</p><p>LIU: At this point.</p><p>Bruce, what about valuations in some of the deals that you're looking at? I mean, you know, we've been hearing, for instance, that some of the stellar, they just want too much in this environment and you wonder why.</p><p>RAUNER: Well, the answer to the question is there's plenty of capital out there. There is a surprising amount of equity capital available across the entire stage of investment. And private equity world, the venture capital world is relatively flush with money.</p><p>And that competition to that money creates is driving valuations high.</p><p>LIU: But what's going on here? Why is that exactly?</p><p>RAUNER: There is a demographic trend where pension funds are very flush with capital...</p><p>LIU: OK.</p><p>RAUNER: ...across corporate America and in state governments. And all that potential (ph) capital is looking for a high rate of return. They can't find it in bond markets. They can't really find it very well in public markets, in the stock market.</p><p>But they've been able to find it historically in venture capital and then private equity. And it's driven into our industry in large amounts.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, you know, looking through when I was doing some research, I mean, you've been actually pretty quite open about saying that the Obama administration, the White House has been hostile to business.</p><p>Why does that matter to you?</p><p>RAUNER: Well, I think the federal government sets a tone and a standard for economic growth. And I think you can't be pro-jobs and pro- economic growth and be anti-business. You can't be about regulation, taxes, coming up with ways to make it more expensive for employees to be hired.</p><p>And unfortunately, in recent years, the federal government has been on that track.</p><p>LIU: And you heard that even more, I mean, he's digging his heels in yesterday when he was talking about private jetsetters and all that sort of stuff in his comments yesterday. What did you make of that?</p><p>RAUNER: Oh, I don't know. I think we are on a bad track today in our attitude between the federal government and business community. And we've got to change that.</p><p>LIU: What about for you?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, you know, in the startup world, we'll talk about that. You know, a lot of that discussion doesn't really impact it. You're talking about, you know, at the earliest stages, one, two, three-person companies. They aren't affected by the discussion about regulation, unions, et cetera.</p><p>And so what they are affected by is capital availability. And right now, in the venture world, there's a lot of capital available. It's not always the case. The problem really is in companies that aren't venture-capital ready.</p><p>And you know, folks who just want to start a restaurants start a small business, a barbershop in their neighborhood, that capital is not available. And the banks aren't loaning.</p><p>LIU: Right. And although we had Rick Waddell earlier who said the banks do want to lend but they are just not finding quality borrowers, essentially, so this debate can go on and on, I know.</p><p>RAUNER: That's true.</p><p>LIU: Bruce, thank you so much.</p><p>And actually, I want you both to hang on because we're going to talk more about the money management world. We're going to be back with <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner </nameText></person>and J.B. Pritzker in just a few moments, live here from Chicago.</p><p>09:18</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>09:23</p><p>LIU: We are back with our two guests here, <person><nameText>Bruce Rauner, </nameText></person>the Chairman and Principal at GTCR, the private equity firm, also J.B. Pritzker with us as well, the Founder of New World Ventures.</p><p>I want to stay with technology for a moment, J.B. Did you invest in Groupon? You did invest, right?</p><p>PRITZKER: We did not.</p><p>LIU: OK. Are you picking yourself for not investing?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, look, it's a great company. And the guys who created it are - they're operators. So they did a great job of putting together. It's a very young company. But it is, you know, a rocket to the stars...</p><p>LIU: But did they approach you at some point?</p><p>PRITZKER: Yes, later on when they were in their later stages.

Y no piensa apartarse de esa pelea.Calvi\u00f1o baraja aplazar el cobro de la tasa Google para evitar el choque con TrumpNacho Alarc\u00f3n. BruselasLa vicepresidenta ha confirmado que el Consejo de Ministros aprobar\u00e1 este martes las tasas Google y Tobin, y quiere \u201cdar un poco de tiempo para ver c\u00f3mo avanza el debate\u201dZuckerberg ha planeado su visita a Bruselas para explicar los intentos de Facebook de autorregularse, de controlarse. Vera Jourov\u00e1, vicepresidenta de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea a cargo de Valores y Democracia, ha explicado que da la bienvenida a los nuevos intentos del gigante digital, pero eso no es suficiente. \u201cEl tiempo de los \u2018acuerdos de caballeros\u2019 ha terminado. </p><p>Deben ir acompa\u00f1ados de regulaci\u00f3n y responsabilidades para las plataformas, y eso es en lo que ya estamos trabajando en la Comisi\u00f3n Europea\u201d, ha asegurado la checa.Cuando Zuckerberg plane\u00f3 su visita a Bruselas, ya sab\u00eda lo que le esperaba. Porque no es nada nuevo y porque es la postura que la Comisi\u00f3n Europea lleva defendiendo ante el gigante digital desde hace mucho tiempo. El americano se ha visto con el comisario de Mercado Interior, el franc\u00e9s Thierry Breton, y tambi\u00e9n con Vestager y con la vicepresidenta Jourov\u00e1.No es la primera vez que Bruselas le aprieta las tuercas al CEO de Facebook. En mayo de 2018, el Parlamento Europeo le llev\u00f3 a una audiencia p\u00fablica con los l\u00edderes de los distintos grupos pol\u00edticos. Zuckerberg pidi\u00f3 perd\u00f3n: \u201cNo hemos hecho lo suficiente para evitar que las herramientas que hemos creado se utilicen tambi\u00e9n para causar da\u00f1o\u201d.\"El tiempo de los \u2018acuerdos de caballeros\u2019 ha terminado. Deben ir acompa\u00f1ados de regulaci\u00f3n y responsabilidades para las plataformas\"Durante la anterior legislatura, Jourov\u00e1 pele\u00f3 para conseguir que las grandes plataformas digitales trabajaran para controlar el discurso del odio en sus propias redes, las noticias falsas y las interferencias que afectaban a los procesos democr\u00e1ticos de los Estados miembros. La checa siempre se mostr\u00f3 disconforme con el trabajo hecho por las compa\u00f1\u00edas, con quienes se reun\u00eda de forma habitual.\u201cMe alegra ver que el pensamiento de Facebook est\u00e1 cambiando y est\u00e1 m\u00e1s alineado con el enfoque europeo en diferentes aspectos regulatorios. Como siempre dije, veo a las \u2018big tech\u2019 como parte de la soluci\u00f3n a los problemas que ellas mismas ayudaron a crear\u201d, ha asegurado Jourov\u00e1 tras el encuentro.La UE est\u00e1 entrando en una nueva semana grande en lo que se refiere a regulaci\u00f3n digital: se prev\u00e9 que publique un 'libro blanco' sobre inteligencia artificial en un ambiente cada vez m\u00e1s tenso entre EEUU, China y los distintos gigantes digitales, con Europa en el centro intentando establecer las normas.La experiencia del GDPR, la ley de protecci\u00f3n de datos europea, es el modelo a seguir para la Comisi\u00f3n Europea: una norma que ha funcionado y que ha sido vista como un ejemplo para implementar en otros pa\u00edses. Ahora, Bruselas se prepara para dar los pr\u00f3ximos pasos, que volver\u00e1n a ser inc\u00f3modos para Facebook, pero con los que el Ejecutivo comunitario quiere ser de nuevo pionero.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecestaticos.com/imagestatic/clipping/7f0/5e1/7f05e1f04e832eccc89c5842c7af20d2/bruselas-aprieta-a-facebook-los-tiempos-de-los-pactos-de-caballeros-han-terminado.jpg?mtime=1581964094\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Zuckerberg y Jourov\u00e1.

La nueva legislaci\u00f3n le permitir\u00eda anticiparse, irrumpir en un sector en su conjunto e impedir que evolucione hacia la concentraci\u00f3n; es decir, actuar con car\u00e1cter profil\u00e1ctico, antes de que se cometa ninguna infracci\u00f3n. \u00bfRecuerdan la pel\u00edcula Minority Report, en la que una unidad policial del futuro pr\u00f3ximo evitaba los delitos antes de que se cometieran? Salvando las distancias cinematogr\u00e1ficas, Vestager aspira a algo similar pero trasladado a la competencia en el \u00e1mbito empresarial.</p><p> Si se aprueba la futura normativa, la Comisi\u00f3n Europea podr\u00eda intervenir preventivamente en mercados que considere que se encaminan hacia una situaci\u00f3n de competencia reducida, sin necesidad de constatar una infracci\u00f3n previa y pudiendo imponer obligaciones de desinversi\u00f3n o de acceso a datos y tecnolog\u00edas , se\u00f1ala Guti\u00e9rrez. Es decir, un escenario que provocar\u00eda un vuelco sin precedentes en la legislaci\u00f3n antimonopolio europea, confiriendo poderes de intervenci\u00f3n inusitados a las autoridades de Competencia.</p><h>En el punto de mira</h><p>Aunque la iniciativa no se circunscribe a un sector en concreto, sino que facultar\u00eda a la Comisi\u00f3n a actuar en cualquier \u00e1rea de actividad, desde el comercio al turismo, pasando por la industria farmac\u00e9utica, donde Bruselas ha puesto ya, de hecho, la lupa en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, todas las miradas est\u00e1n puestas en los gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos, como Google, Facebook o Amazon, que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os han ido extendiendo su tent\u00e1culos a diferentes ramas de negocio en un sinuoso efecto de mancha de aceite. Pero tambi\u00e9n en los emergentes, en los gigantes que est\u00e1n por venir.</p><p>Google ya irrumpi\u00f3 en el negocio de sistemas de pago, con Google Pay, y a finales del a\u00f1o pasado logr\u00f3 que el Banco de Lituania le concediera una licencia para operar como entidad de dinero electr\u00f3nico, franqueando una puerta de entrada a Europa para su proyecto de ofrecer servicios financieros: Google Bank. El desembarco de las tecnol\u00f3gicas en el sector financiero se ha convertido en uno de los mayores dolores de cabeza de la banca tradicional.</p><p>Uber, tras ser acusada por los taxistas europeos de querer romper el mercado, opera tambi\u00e9n en sectores tan dispares como el de comida a domicilio o la salud, mientras que Amazon, que comenz\u00f3 su trayectoria como una simple librer\u00eda online, es hoy un gigante del comercio electr\u00f3nico, ofrece servicios de almacenamiento en la nube (cloud computing), y compite con gigantes como Netflix en el negocio del v\u00eddeo online.</p><h>El espejo brit\u00e1nico</h><p>La nueva legislaci\u00f3n, que se encuentra a\u00fan en fase incipiente, recibe en parte su inspiraci\u00f3n del Reino Unido, donde la poderosa Autoridad de la Competencia y los Mercados brit\u00e1nica (CMA, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) tiene licencia para abordar investigaciones en sectores completos e imponer severas condiciones, entre las que figura la obligaci\u00f3n de desprenderse de activos y negocios si estima que existe un alto grado de concentraci\u00f3n.</p><p>En 2013, las autoridades brit\u00e1nicas de Competencia irrumpieron en el sector sanitario y obligaron a los dos mayores grupos hospitalarios privados presentes en el pa\u00eds, HCA y BMI, a desprenderse de casi una decena de hospitales, llegando incluso a restringir los incentivos a los m\u00e9dicos para evitar que desviasen pacientes hacia un determinado centro sanitario.</p><p>En plena era del coronavirus y el Brexit, las autoridades brit\u00e1nicas quieren ampliar a\u00fan m\u00e1s sus ya de por s\u00ed extensas prerrogativas con la lupa puesta en la big tech estadounidenses.</p><p>El regulador brit\u00e1nico busca reforzar su poder para imponer multas a las compa\u00f1\u00edas que realizan pr\u00e1cticas anticompetitivas sin pasar por los tribunales, garant\u00eda que se exige actualmente, y para poder suspender cautelarmente dichas actividades aunque la investigaci\u00f3n no haya concluido. Un endurecimiento de su labor de supervisi\u00f3n y control que persigue pese a las advertencias de que ese hostigamiento contra los gigantes digitales podr\u00eda lastrar la llegada de inversi\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica al Reino Unido tras el Brexit.</p><p>El caso de Amazon y Deliveroo resulta ilustrativo del modus operandi del regulador brit\u00e1nico. En diciembre pasado, la CMA puso en cuarentena la entrada de Amazon en el capital de la plataforma de reparto de comida a domicilio, que se hab\u00eda producido en mayo, por considerar que dar\u00eda lugar a una situaci\u00f3n relevante de fusi\u00f3n, lo que, a su vez, podr\u00eda acarrear una  diminuci\u00f3n sustancial  de la competencia en cualquier mercado o mercados de bienes o servicios en el Reino Unido. Es decir, la autoridad brit\u00e1nica opt\u00f3 por poner la venda antes de la herida. Parad\u00f3jicamente, la CMA decidi\u00f3 en abril pasado dar luz verde provisional al desembarco de Amazon en Deliveroo para evitar la quiebra de esta \u00faltima a ra\u00edz de la crisis del coronavirus, que amenaza con provocar la asfixia financiera de cientos de miles de empresas europeas. El regulador argument\u00f3 que la salida de Deliveroo del mercado brit\u00e1nico  ser\u00eda peor para la competencia que permitir la inversi\u00f3n de Amazon , lo que finalmente inclin\u00f3 la balanza del lado de la autorizaci\u00f3n.</p><p>La iniciativa de Vestager se produce en plena pandemia del Covid-19, que ha puesto en jaque conceptos que eran indiscutibles hasta hace apenas unos meses, como la globalizaci\u00f3n o el libre mercado, haciendo soplar aires de proteccionismo en la UE y de intervenci\u00f3n sin precedentes del sector p\u00fablico en el privado al dar luz verde a inyecciones generalizadas de los Estados en sus empresas para evitar quiebras. Una operaci\u00f3n de salvamento masiva que, tal como reconoce la propia Vestager, puede provocar la fractura del mercado \u00fanico.</p><p>De momento, ya ha provocado los primeros roces entre las autoridades europeas de Competencia y algunos Estados miembros, a cuenta, por ejemplo, de las ayudas de 9.000 millones de Alemania a Lufthansa. Para acceder a ellas, Bruselas obliga a la aerol\u00ednea a renunciar a sus hub en los aeropuertos de Fr\u00e1ncfort y M\u00fanich.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Margrethe Vestager, vicepresidenta de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea y responsable de Competencia en el Ejecutivo comunitario.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPNSN-18737575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPNSN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601V-Y651-F068-F02H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">310181</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Recoletos Grupo de Comunicaci\u00f3n S.A.

Ken Paxton, Texas's top law officer, said he had seen evidence that Google violated competition rules. Thanks to its huge trove of personal information, it \"undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation [and] violated users' privacy\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their investigation marks a sea change in America's oversight of its technology industry. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, but took no action. However, times have changed. Public anger over privacy violations, tax dodging and disinformation has turned the industry from a prodigal child into a pariah. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the commission over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and there are inquiries into Big Tech at state and federal level. A day of reckoning seems to be approaching, even if US politicians are unsure how to tame their buccaneering companies.</p><p>The crackdown in the United States is no isolated event. Washington is taking its lead from the European Commission, which has become the most potent regulator of the technology industry, setting standards that others are adopting. Margrethe Vestager, appointed to another five-year term as the competition commissioner yesterday, has been Big Tech's tormentor-in-chief. Since 2017, she has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for abusing its dominance in online search, mobile phone software and online advertising.</p><p>Before that, she ordered Apple to pay Ireland (EURO)13 billion in back taxes. Apple and Google are <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.appealing.No\">www.appealing.No</url> wonder Ms Vestager has earned the displeasure of President Trump. In June he tweeted that she \"hates the United States perhaps more than anyone I've ever met\". Expect more fireworks during her term as Europe''s antitrust enforcer. Ms Vestager has been made de facto \"tech czar\", with powers to write the rules for the European Union's digital economy, as well as to implement them.</p><p>Her elevation is a tacit acknowledgment that the present regulatory has failed. For all the acclaim she has won for her attempts to rein in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple retain their strangleholds over large portions of the internet economy. Alphabet, Google's parent, has added a new reporting line to financial results called European Commission Fines. It suggests that to the $840 billion goliath financial penalties are a mere business expense, an unavoidable cost of doing business in Europe.</p><p>In the past Facebook, YouTube and other \"free\" platforms have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. How, for example, do you prove that consumers have been harmed when they are not paying for a service? But there are signs that Europe is moving towards a fundamentally different approach to policing Big Tech. Local watchdogs are beginning to take the EU's data privacy laws into account in competition cases. In a landmark decision in February, Germany's cartel office ruled that Facebook had abused its dominant position in social networking to improperly gather data on its users without their consent. Of particular concern was its practice of melding data from third-party apps with information gleaned from Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram and the tracking of non-users through \"like\" or \"share\" buttons. Facebook was ordered to desist, but has won a temporary reprieve while it appeals against the decision.</p><p>The monopolists of today derive their power from the industrial scale harvesting of personal information. This digital surveillance will be top of Ms Vestager's list of targets as she designs new rules for Europe's digital economy.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-152845034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1K-4PP1-DYTY-C2W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ken Paxton, Texas's top law officer, said he had seen evidence that Google violated competition rules. Thanks to its huge trove of personal information, it \"undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation [and] violated users' privacy\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their investigation marks a sea change in America's oversight of its technology industry. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, but took no action. However, times have changed. Public anger over privacy violations, tax dodging and disinformation has turned the industry from a prodigal child into a pariah. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the commission over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and there are inquiries into Big Tech at state and federal level. A day of reckoning seems to be approaching, even if US politicians are unsure how to tame their buccaneering companies.</p><p>The crackdown in the United States is no isolated event. Washington is taking its lead from the European Commission, which has become the most potent regulator of the technology industry, setting standards that others are adopting. Margrethe Vestager, appointed to another five-year term as the competition commissioner yesterday, has been Big Tech's tormentor-in-chief. Since 2017, she has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for abusing its dominance in online search, mobile phone software and online advertising. Before that, she ordered Apple to pay Ireland (EURO)13 billion in back taxes. Apple and Google are appealing.</p><p>No wonder Ms Vestager has earned the displeasure of President Trump. In June he tweeted that she \"hates the United States perhaps more than anyone I've ever met\". Expect more fireworks during her term as Europe''s antitrust enforcer. Ms Vestager has been made de facto \"tech czar\", with powers to write the rules for the European Union's digital economy, as well as to implement them.</p><p>Her elevation is a tacit acknowledgment that the present regulatory has failed. For all the acclaim she has won for her attempts to rein in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple retain their strangleholds over large portions of the internet economy. Alphabet, Google's parent, has added a new reporting line to financial results called European Commission Fines. It suggests that to the $840 billion goliath financial penalties are a mere business expense, an unavoidable cost of doing business in Europe.</p><p>In the past Facebook, YouTube and other \"free\" platforms have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. How, for example, do you prove that consumers have been harmed when they are not paying for a service? But there are signs that Europe is moving towards a fundamentally different approach to policing Big Tech. Local watchdogs are beginning to take the EU's data privacy laws into account in competition cases.</p><p>In a landmark decision in February, Germany's cartel office ruled that Facebook had abused its dominant position in social networking to improperly gather data on its users without their consent. Of particular concern was its practice of melding data from third-party apps with information gleaned from Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram and the tracking of non-users through \"like\" or \"share\" buttons. Facebook was ordered to desist, but has won a temporary reprieve while it appeals against the decision.</p><p>The monopolists of today derive their power from the industrial scale harvesting of personal information. This digital surveillance will be top of Ms Vestager's list of targets as she designs new rules for Europe's digital economy.</p><p>                   Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-56013254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1F-4T51-JCJY-G29Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><timeReceived>4:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Ken Paxton, Texas's top law officer, said he had seen evidence that Google violated competition rules. Thanks to its huge trove of personal information, it \"undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation [and] violated users' privacy\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their investigation marks a sea change in America's oversight of its technology industry. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, but took no action. However, times have changed. Public anger over privacy violations, tax dodging and disinformation has turned the industry from a prodigal child into a pariah. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the commission over the Cambridge Analtyica scandal and there are inquiries into Big Tech at state and federal level. A day of reckoning seems to be approaching, even if US politicians are unsure how to tame their buccaneering companies.</p><p>The crackdown in the United States is no isolated event. Washington is taking its lead from the European Commission, which has become the most potent regulator of the technology industry, setting standards that others are adopting. Margrethe Vestager, appointed to another five-year term as the competition commissioner yesterday, has been Big Tech's tormentor-in-chief. Since 2017, she has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for abusing its dominance in online search, mobile phone software and online advertising.</p><p>Before that, she ordered Apple to pay Ireland (EURO)13 billion in back taxes. Apple and Google are <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.appealing.No\">www.appealing.No</url> wonder Ms Vestager has earned the displeasure of President Trump. In June he tweeted that she \"hates the United States perhaps more than anyone I've ever met\". Expect more fireworks during her term as Europe''s antitrust enforcer. Ms Vestager has been made de facto \"tech csar\", with powers to write the rules for the European Union's digital economy, as well as to implement them.</p><p>Her elevation is a tacit acknowledgement that the present regulatory has failed. For all the acclaim she has won for her attempts to rein in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple retain their strangleholds over large portions of the internet economy. Alphabet, Google's parent, has added a new reporting line to financial results called European Commission Fines. It suggests that to the $840 billion goliath financial penalties are a mere business expense, an unavoidable cost of doing business in Europe.</p><p>In the past Facebook, YouTube and other \"free\" platforms have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. How, for example, do you prove that consumers have been harmed when they are not paying for a service? But there are signs that Europe is moving towards a fundamentally different approach to policing Big Tech. Local watchdogs are beginning to take the EU's data privacy laws into account in competition cases. In a landmark decision in February, Germany's cartel office ruled that Facebook had abused its dominant position in social networking to improperly gather data on its users without their consent. Of particular concern was its practice of melding data from third-party apps with information gleaned from Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram and the tracking of non-users through through \"like\" or \"share\" buttons. Facebook was ordered to desist, but has won a temporary reprieve while it appeals against the decision.</p><p>The monopolists of today derive their power from the industrial scale harvesting of personal information. This digital surveillance will be top of Ms Vestager's list of targets as she designs new rules for Europe's digital economy.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-152839299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1K-4PP1-DYTY-C2NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ken Paxton, Texas's top law officer, said he had seen evidence that Google violated competition rules. Thanks to its huge trove of personal information, it \"undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation [and] violated users' privacy\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their investigation marks a sea change in America's oversight of its technology industry. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, but took no action. However, times have changed. Public anger over privacy violations, tax dodging and disinformation has turned the industry from a prodigal child into a pariah. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the commission over the Cambridge Analtyica scandal and there are inquiries into Big Tech at state and federal level. A day of reckoning seems to be approaching, even if US politicians are unsure how to tame their buccaneering companies.</p><p>The crackdown in the United States is no isolated event. Washington is taking its lead from the European Commission, which has become the most potent regulator of the technology industry, setting standards that others are adopting. Margrethe Vestager, appointed to another five-year term as the competition commissioner yesterday, has been Big Tech's tormentor-in-chief. Since 2017, she has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for abusing its dominance in online search, mobile phone software and online advertising.</p><p>Before that, she ordered Apple to pay Ireland (EURO)13 billion in back taxes. Apple and Google are <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.appealing.No\">www.appealing.No</url> wonder Ms Vestager has earned the displeasure of President Trump. In June he tweeted that she \"hates the United States perhaps more than anyone I've ever met\". Expect more fireworks during her term as Europe''s antitrust enforcer. Ms Vestager has been made de facto \"tech csar\", with powers to write the rules for the European Union's digital economy, as well as to implement them.</p><p>Her elevation is a tacit acknowledgement that the present regulatory has failed. For all the acclaim she has won for her attempts to rein in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple retain their strangleholds over large portions of the internet economy. Alphabet, Google's parent, has added a new reporting line to financial results called European Commission Fines. It suggests that to the $840 billion goliath financial penalties are a mere business expense, an unavoidable cost of doing business in Europe.</p><p>In the past Facebook, YouTube and other \"free\" platforms have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. How, for example, do you prove that consumers have been harmed when they are not paying for a service? But there are signs that Europe is moving towards a fundamentally different approach to policing Big Tech. Local watchdogs are beginning to take the EU's data privacy laws into account in competition cases. In a landmark decision in February, Germany's cartel office ruled that Facebook had abused its dominant position in social networking to improperly gather data on its users without their consent. Of particular concern was its practice of melding data from third-party apps with information gleaned from Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram and the tracking of non-users through through \"like\" or \"share\" buttons. Facebook was ordered to desist, but has won a temporary reprieve while it appeals against the decision.</p><p>The monopolists of today derive their power from the industrial scale harvesting of personal information. This digital surveillance will be top of Ms Vestager's list of targets as she designs new rules for Europe's digital economy.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-152848009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1K-4PP1-DYTY-C333-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ken Paxton, Texas's top law officer, said he had seen evidence that Google violated competition rules. Thanks to its huge trove of personal information, it \"undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation [and] violated users' privacy\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their investigation marks a sea change in America's oversight of its technology industry. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, but took no action. However, times have changed. Public anger over privacy violations, tax dodging and disinformation has turned the industry from a prodigal child into a pariah. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the commission over the Cambridge Analtyica scandal and there are inquiries into Big Tech at state and federal level. A day of reckoning seems to be approaching, even if US politicians are unsure how to tame their buccaneering companies.</p><p>The crackdown in the United States is no isolated event. Washington is taking its lead from the European Commission, which has become the most potent regulator of the technology industry, setting standards that others are adopting. Margrethe Vestager, appointed to another five-year term as the competition commissioner yesterday, has been Big Tech's tormentor-in-chief. Since 2017, she has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for abusing its dominance in online search, mobile phone software and online advertising.</p><p>Before that, she ordered Apple to pay Ireland (EURO)13 billion in back taxes. Apple and Google are <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.appealing.No\">www.appealing.No</url> wonder Ms Vestager has earned the displeasure of President Trump. In June he tweeted that she \"hates the United States perhaps more than anyone I've ever met\". Expect more fireworks during her term as Europe''s antitrust enforcer. Ms Vestager has been made de facto \"tech csar\", with powers to write the rules for the European Union's digital economy, as well as to implement them.</p><p>Her elevation is a tacit acknowledgement that the present regulatory has failed. For all the acclaim she has won for her attempts to rein in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple retain their strangleholds over large portions of the internet economy. Alphabet, Google's parent, has added a new reporting line to financial results called European Commission Fines. It suggests that to the $840 billion goliath financial penalties are a mere business expense, an unavoidable cost of doing business in Europe.</p><p>In the past Facebook, YouTube and other \"free\" platforms have been elusive prey for competition watchdogs. How, for example, do you prove that consumers have been harmed when they are not paying for a service? But there are signs that Europe is moving towards a fundamentally different approach to policing Big Tech. Local watchdogs are beginning to take the EU's data privacy laws into account in competition cases. In a landmark decision in February, Germany's cartel office ruled that Facebook had abused its dominant position in social networking to improperly gather data on its users without their consent. Of particular concern was its practice of melding data from third-party apps with information gleaned from Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram and the tracking of non-users through through \"like\" or \"share\" buttons. Facebook was ordered to desist, but has won a temporary reprieve while it appeals against the decision.</p><p>The monopolists of today derive their power from the industrial scale harvesting of personal information. This digital surveillance will be top of Ms Vestager's list of targets as she designs new rules for Europe's digital economy.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-152847435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1K-4PP1-DYTY-C2FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They are registered in the country and the regulator has yet to administer any fines.\u00a0</p><p>Brussels noted that the Irish data protection office had opened 15 investigations into international companies under the GDPR.</p><p>\u201cThe success of the regulation should not be measured by the number of fines imposed, but by changes in the culture and behaviour of all actors involved,\u201d said the commission. </p><p>Instead of using sanctions powers, the EU urged regulators to use other tools in the GDPR, such as ordering temporary bans on the processing of data by companies. </p><p>EU officials noted that the lack of high-profile fines was a result of authorities wanting to put together legally watertight cases against companies or risk being taken to court.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is essential that data protection authorities gather relevant evidence, respect all procedural steps under national legislation and ensure due process in often complex files,\u201d the commission said. \u201cThis requires time and involves a significant amount of work, which explains why most of the investigations launched after the entry into application of the regulation are still ongoing.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-3629b0fcad7311e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-9X01-DXP9-93JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><timeReceived>6:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
