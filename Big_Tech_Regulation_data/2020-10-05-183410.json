UBS was brilliant 12  months, 14 months ago on Sterling.  The world was coming to an end as we  know, and you said, no, Sterling stability and even some Sterling strength.   I guess the world is coming to an end for the dollar.  Can you look for  dollar stability or dollar strength?</p><p>THEMOS FIOTAKIS, CO-HEAD FX &amp; RATES, UBS:  Definitely, we cannot  extrapolate the pace of depreciation as it has been.  But part of what you  call Sterling stability has been the fact the dollar has weakened across a  number of currencies, including Sterling.  So the big dollar driver is  there and there are very fundamental drivers that mean we still have a  little bit further dollar weakness to go in the months ahead.  Maybe not at  this pace, but definitely the direction is there.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So what kind of level are you looking  at?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  So for the euro-dollar, we have 1.25 for this year and 1.30 for  next year and that's about it.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.</p><p>KEENE:  Themos Fiotakis, we will continue this conversation with UBS.  Lots  to talk about on foreign exchange today.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  We are back with Themos Fiotakis of UBS.  Themos, I think I have a  euro trade wage chart, which actually I'd love to show you if we can bring  that up on stage.  So this is -- I don't know if there's a difference  between trade wage or this is the real one that we're looking at.  And  where do you expect that to go depending on how markets perceive the ECB?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  So I think what captions this very nice trade-weighted chart is  that the euro has been for a while undervalued.  Part of the reason why it  has been undervalued is the exception of values of the ECB.  Even today,  the European bonds are the most expensive in the world among the major  countries.  European yields are way too low.  And as the ECB exits, this  should correct the fair value and this is for bunds.  It's somewhere  between 1 and 1.3.  But keep in mind that they will still be buying bonds  for the majority of this year and they will be absorbing more than the  supply of German revenue bunds.  So yields will be under control.</p><p>And even if they tweak their forward guidance, they will be making very  sure that they actually imprint it on the market's minds that this is going  to happen sometime a lot later after they actually stop purchasing bonds,  potentially in 2019 story.  And that has been actually in the core of some  of the comments that we have seen in the recent weeks as the euro has been  rising a little bit faster than we would have expected.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  So what are you expecting ECB policy to actually be?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  So gradually --</p><p>LACQUA:  And policy and asset purchase by December?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Yes, by the end of the year, they will have ramped it up and  sometime in the middle of next year it's going to be hikes.</p><p>KEENE:  I look, Themos, at the optimal price of euro.  I've never seen an  academic or market study that says the euro is an intelligent system,  you've got too many different economies.  Single point optimum German euro  where are chance (inaudible) euro.  And as a point of discussion, look at  Italy flat on its back granted recovering on a per capita basis, what's the  optimum Italian value for Euro?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Always, and all of these models, there's a wide differential.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Double-digit --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Yes, I know.  Right.  And correct me, (inaudible) made you say  that, right?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  No, I actually.  I think we would agree on that.  But I think  that what is really important for aggregate for the euro area, the euro  being monetary union is still competitive at 1.30 for the euro-dollar and  that includes also Italy, which has not -- but when the euro does well,  Italy does well as well.  Maybe it would've done better if the euro was  lower.  But it will continue to do it.</p><p>KEENE:  This is really important.  In the Italian election, you are  suggesting the currency dynamics are the litmus paper of currency is the  secondary or tertiary indicator of how well Italy will do in the future?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  That's right and even further more now that you mentioned the  Italian elections, we actually view the election as a catalyst that will  unlock some risk premium of the positive catalyst.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Italy still maintains one of the very wide risk premiums out  there and the fundamentals are a lot better than perceived by the market.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Well, let's rip up the script here and go to your political  analysts' best outcomes for Italy?  Does it involved -- first I tell you,  what is the coalition that is the best outcome for Italy and for that  advanced risk premium?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Well, the statement we have made is, obviously, the dynamics and  how the votes here have shifted, of course, Italian makes a coalition more  likely and a coalition which now sees very little scope for revising any  kind of euro acceptance in Italian referendum.</p><p>LACQUA:  But what happens to reforms?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Well, reforms, it depends on what the pricing is.  The pricing  is still for recession.  At the same time, you have risk premium and  Italian bonds, you have (inaudible) which are quite trading quite poorly,  and you have GDP which is recovering.  Not just per capita basis.   Unemployment rate (inaudible) decline and all of this has not been in the  price primarily because people are worried about the instability that  elections may trigger.  So any kind of coalition that is actually viable is  --</p><p>KEENE:  Is constructive.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  At least for the next six months.</p><p>KEENE:  Very good.  Themos, thank you so much and we will continue.  Mr.  Fiotakis is with UBS.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  We're back to talk currencies with Themos Fiotakis of UBS.   Themos, when you look at pound, do you look at cable or does euro-pound  give you a different story?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  I think euro-pound is very important to watch now, now that  euro-dollar has actually moved cable higher come.  All this stability,  which is still stability despite the fact that the euro-Sterling is  grinding higher with pound stability, there is one underlying factor behind  this.  And U.K. is a very global economy, have a lot of global-based firms,  such as the one we are in here and the surge in global profits has actually  been reflected in the U.K.'s current account, the U.K.'s current account  has improved, the balance of flows into the U.K. has improved because of  global deflation.</p><p>Now, to me, the fact that we are not trading stronger despite global  reflation, despite the Bank of England tightening, despite the fact that we  have had a year where the data is printed better than the community would  have expected, it makes you think that the underlying current for Sterling  is actually still to weaken against the euro.  And potentially gradually as  long as global reflation continues, we will see this grind higher, euro- Sterling grind higher.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Are there any kind of different pairs that we don't often  look at?  I mean Tom was joking that we're looking at Polish zloty, but I  don't know if there's a pound zloty dynamic duo that you're looking at.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  There's definitely a lot of these ideas to think.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Sterling and Swiss will probably underperform Central and  Eastern European currencies (inaudible).  So these are some interesting  classes to think about.</p><p>KEENE:  See how he answered that question without giving us a currency  pair?</p><p>LACQUA:  But he is good.</p><p>KEENE:  That is a rare skill.  OK, Czech Swiss (inaudible) I'll make a  chart of it and put out on Twitter.  You'll see it first up there.  Czech  Swiss, I think that's C-H-S, hyphen, C-Z-K.  Did I get that right?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  That's right.</p><p>LACQUA:  Oh, wow.</p><p>KEENE:  Oh, my word.  Bonus round.  Themos Fiotakis is with us of UBS on  the comparison of the Swiss Franc to the Czech.  What is it Krona?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Krona.</p><p>KEENE:  Krona to be here in Mexico.  Czech-krona, OK, we'll do that.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Thomas Fiotakis with us of UBS and Kona Haque.  I'm thrilled to  have you on set.  I was fascinated by your analysis of robust and coffee.   We can bring up the chart here of coffee and a slowdown in all that.  Is  the analysis in trading of soft the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago or  vague into a revolution in commodity just like everything else?</p><p>KONA HAQUE, HEAD OF GROUP RESEARCH, ED&amp;F MAN:  Yes.  To a certain extent,  they have.  And analysis is very much broadly still supply and demand.   Ultimately for agricultural commodities, it is very supply-side driven,  because demand tends to be very constant in coffees going stable 2 percent  per year.  But it is supply that drives that, because it's growing tropical  countries.  So what is the weather in Brazil, what's the weather in  Vietnam?</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.  So it sounds like it was 20, 30 years ago.  But within your  coffee analysis, Brazil, I get the usual names, there is the new kid on the  block, Vietnam as well.  So is there a new complexity which makes it harder  for commodity traders to get on trend?</p><p>HAQUE:  I think what sets coffee apart from the rest is that actual on the  ground supply for the information is not really prevalent.  You don't have  the USDA that's constantly reporting on what the production was at all.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Exactly.  Where as for coffee, you really have to be on the ground,  literally counting the cherries on the tree to see how big the crop is  going to be.  And you are right, there is Vietnam, there's Honduras,  there's Columbia, there's Mexico, Peru.  You have to agronomist on the  group to literally count the numbers.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.  Is it different from cocoa?  And I don't know whether we do  have a cocoa chart, right, but this was one of the first things that I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  She doesn't do this at any day but Friday.  I have to discover a  cocoa chart right now?</p><p>LACQUA:  The cocoa, this is depending on drought, this is depending on a  lot of producers where you have social unrest, such as the Ivory Coast.</p><p>HAQUE:  Yes, yes, absolutely.  It is, again, boots on the ground.  That is  the only way you can find out really what is happening to those production,  because it is not large necessarily scale.  It is usually one man and his  hectare of land.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  So Kona, if you look at the kind of soft commodity landscape,  what will do well in 2018?</p><p>HAQUE:  Well, it is tricky.  I mean you just talk about oil that's method  (ph).  There's I think on the back of a strong economic global growth,  those look quite positive, particularly if we have a weaker U.S. dollar.   As some people are saying, again, that's mostly for commodities.  But soft  in grains, generally, I don't think we're going to share that uplift in  commodities, because the story, fundamentally, is not quite there.</p><p>Both sugar and grains right now are very well supplied.  So we have  oversupplied that, so price should stay under pressure.  Coffee,  technically, is in a deficit.  But the 2018 crops will be large.  So fund  futures will be looking ahead at big crops and so they will be looking to  discount that.</p><p>So I don't think you're going to see the kind of push up in prices in these  crops as you've seen in (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.  And one more question on cocoa.  Actually, I make a joke  about it, Francine, but I'm thrilled you brought it up.  Cocoa has always  been the volatility of it.  You can get on it, you can play the game.  Is  there still a depth of market in the sauce (ph) that you followed for  years?  Is there still enough of a game being played where it's a good bid,  it's a good ask to tic?</p><p>HAQUE:  Yes, I think so.  I think that very much depends on if you have  insight that other people don't necessarily have.  But something has  changed fundamentally from 20 to 30 years ago.</p><p>KEENE:  What is that?</p><p>HAQUE:  It is the amount of system funds that are involved in the futures  market.  They now are probably 50 percent to 60 percent off the total open  interest.</p><p>KEENE:  Wow.</p><p>HAQUE:  And they don't follow fundamentals.</p><p>KEENE:  They're doing almost a black box on cocoa or coffee?</p><p>HAQUE:  Yes.  And it's very difficult to trade that.</p><p>KEENE:  Do they make out from that, do they make money on that?  I am  fascinated from you on the trenches of what you think of bitcoin.  I  believe bitcoin is not a soft.  So if you don't want to talk about it, I  get it.  But you have been in the battle of commodities, getting it right,  getting it wrong, making a ton of money going down in flames.  What are  your thoughts when you look at the bid-ask quality of bitcoin?</p><p>HAQUE:  Well, that is tricky, because I've been so used to looking at  markets on a fundamental basis.  I am struggling to understand the  fundamental of bitcoin.  I understand that by 2040, you can't produce that  many because of mining system finishes.  The demand then depends on the  likes of Amazon adopting it as a currency.  But then you have this new  thing where you have regulators who are not necessarily going for it or  (inaudible) government.  And that to me feels a bit scary.</p><p>LACQUA:  Themos can't wait to talk bitcoin.  I knew it was coming.  Do you  want to talk about bitcoin or actually you wanted just to talk?  This is  like a free get out of jail card.  You can also talk about commodity  nations and what is that or currency.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  Please.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  The fact that soft commodities are going to be in -- not going  up so fast is very important for merging markets.  By far, the biggest  driver of inflation for merging is soft commodities.  And the fact that it  haven't split means emerging market inflation is probably going to be Czech  despite the higher oil price.</p><p>LACQUA:  You see how you avoided bitcoin there.</p><p>KEENE:  Let's get that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA:  It was like a master -- when you look at emerging markets, though,  Themos, a lot of the gains that we have seen have to do with artificial  intelligence, right? And some of the components, for example, that's  driving equity stocks down, right, wood tech, chips, and the like.  Is it  the same for currency or do investors look at things such as commodities,  inflation, and anything in between?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Definitely, the theme for emerging markets has been this year  the equity side and particularly the tech side.  I have to say, though,  that the theme is broadening out because primarily of how strong China is  in the background, how strong Chinese consumption is in the background.  So  if you're looking for the next equity theme in emerging markets, I think  the China consumption story is going to take (ph).</p><p>KEENE:  Is china part of soft?</p><p>HAQUE:  Yes.</p><p>KEENE:  Is it a growing part?</p><p>HAQUE:  Definitely, for sure there.</p><p>KEENE:  Give us a quick example -- I want to come back on this, but give us  a quick example of China in soft.  Is it cotton?</p><p>HAQUE:  Cotton, sugar, coffee, in a declining order.</p><p>KEENE:  Cotton, sugar, and coffee.</p><p>HAQUE:  Or obviously before that, the soybeans.</p><p>KEENE:  Do I know Chinese sugar?  When I have Chinese sugar, is it just  sort of going?</p><p>HAQUE:  Sorry, I am talking about consumption.</p><p>KEENE:  Oh, consumption, I am talking about what they make.  They make  cotton, right, cotton, cotton, cotto.</p><p>HAQUE:  But even then, they have mastered importer, China is still an  importer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAQUE:  Because they have a big tech sales industry.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>HAQUE:  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  How much do they consume?  So we were trying to figure out the  China GDP story.  Yesterday, it was -- they're going to use less of the  commodities for infrastructure, because a lot of them has already been  used.  So that will have longer-term impact on (inaudible) copper, zinc,  and the like.  Do they drink coffee?  And will they drink less coffee this  year?</p><p>HAQUE:  So if they follow the path of Japan and South Korea have been  doing, then yes, we think that they make that move from traditional tea to  old coffee.  And certainly, Starbucks is opening as shop every other day in  the main cities of China.  So, yes, that whole western coffee coach is  definitely is growing.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Generally speaking, across different parts of commodity  spectrum, this is why the ball is the QE dollar that supplies a lot of  food, particularly China.</p><p>KEENE:  There you go.  Themos Fiotakis with UBS.  Kona, thank you so much  for joining us.  It's wonderful that you're with ED&amp;F Man as well.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  With us today, Themos Fiotakis of UBS.  We're going to chart out a  single chart.  You know it's going to be single best chart.  It's going to  be our newest dollar.  This is the Bloomberg dollar index that we've zoomed  in to a short-term deal.  I've (inaudible) on Twitter for Radio London here  in a bit.  And it's a kind of chart that comes down, we go September, lows  up we go and we roll over again.  As you mentioned, Themos, at the  beginning of the hour, we've got some acceleration, we've got some gamma,  gamma, gamma, we're plunging down here.  Let's start with the why.  Why do  we have the sudden drop?  Why do we have the gamma and dollar right now,  weak dollar?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Well, you have a number of different factors.  The most  important driver of all of these tactics in the short-term is the ongoing  easing in financial conditions, easier financial conditions driven by  growth.  You have higher equities, you have higher oil prices, weaker  dollar, it's all basically endogenous.  And you also have a couple of  events, including the government shutdown, which maybe exacerbating some of  the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  But there is also -- within those type one ideas, it is this,  it's this, it's this.  It is also what's not going out on, what is not  going on is inflation.  Or does UBS see inflation percolating?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Look, I mean it is not going on now, but you have a weaker  dollar which hasn't yet fed through the numbers.  You have higher oil  prices.  These things, even arithmetically around the middle f the year may  bring U.S. headline, CPI inflation close to 3 percent</p><p>KEENE:  All right.  What about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEENE:  That is quite a statement.  You are predicting 3 percent U.S.  inflation?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Yes, a little below that.  But if the dollar now continues, go  like this around the middle of the year, again very specifically on the  year, headline CPI will jump.</p><p>LACQUA:  But Themos, what does that mean for treasuries?  I mean if CPI is,  or PCU, which is maybe the preferred term for Fed (inaudible), it could be  -- they could tightened significantly quite violently.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Look, I think that for now, we need some inflation, because the  worry has been that we are not delivering some of that.  At the same time,  I think that what -- the front end, what has allowed the market to price in  more Fed hikes has been strong equities.  If they hike in an environment of  financial conditions are easing, equities are strong, growth is strong, the  market will absorb it.  It's not going to be an issue.  The curve will  flatten, move invert, and the market will absorb it.  And given that a lot  of that is priced in on the long-end of the curve, and the U.S. is going to  have lesser that stock in the dollar.</p><p>LACQUA:  Are there bubbles anywhere in the market?  And would that be the  trigger?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Bubble is a difficult word to use.  There are points of  vulnerability.  For instance, we have highlighted that parts of the U.S.  high yields credit spectrum, the very low end of the credit quality is more  susceptible to higher rates.  And that is going to underperform, some of  our trade recommendations have some of that color.</p><p>KEENE:  Well, let's get back.  I don't know if the chart (inaudible), but  you mentioned Eastern Europe is a place where you could see some real  movement.  Those are more Trump-like governments right now.  There has been  real political changes or noise better said, there has been noise.  Is that  good noise for their currencies?  Does that develop sort of an  authoritarian certitude that leads to stronger currencies?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  So the smaller of an economy, it will move away from the states  and the likes and we go into small open economy.  They are mostly  reflecting how they are positioned in the global set up.  These economies  have rebalanced significantly, whereas (inaudible).  They have recovered  quite significantly so that other gaps are closed. And at the same time,  they are benefiting a lot from strength in Europe.  And at the same time,  they have better --</p><p>KEENE:  Economic strengths, are they harmed by a stronger euro?  I mean  that's what Draghi -- what Draghi does, does it matter for the Baltic  States on down south?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  It does matter, and for sure it creates a signal with respect to  how their own Central Banks are priced and we're going to be talking about  broad statement basically.</p><p>LACQUA:  Themos, you haven't even talked on yen.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Yes.</p><p>LACUQA:  Why?  What is your call on yen?  Do we know -- does it actually  get impacted by inflation expectations, or it could be impacted by the fact  that Governor Kuroda may not get another term?</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Hugely, by all of these factors.  The first and most important  thing to keep in mind is that Japan has a Phillips curve and it is  inflating.  And that's what our economist, James Macron s actually  projecting.  As inflation expectations go up in Japan, real rates compress.   That should drive the yen initially weaker.  As the yen weakens, inflation  picks up.  The Bank of Japan should revise its inflation target and yield  curve target higher by 20 basis points or so.  And this creates  opportunities, both for the yen and for the yield curve, which is steepened  there and bonds actually getting some light after spending a lot of time  doing nothing.</p><p>LACQUA:  But Themos, if Governor Kuroda were to step down or not be  reappointed or choose to retire, whatever you want to call it, then would  his legacy be --</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Live on?</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes, success.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  I think that you have to think of what kind of like succeeds  him.  And the names that have flown around in the press, they're very  dovish (ph), all the names.</p><p>KEENE:  This has been great.  Themos Fiotakis, thank you so much.</p><p>FIOTAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>KEENE:  Greatly appreciate it.  It has been a wonderful brief in this  morning.  Of course, we do this with a weaker dollar this morning.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

I do not mean to disappoint you this year either, so here you find some thoughts about the top medical technologies of 2017. 2016 was a rich year for medical technology[1]. Virtual Reality. Augmented Reality. Smart algorithms analysing wearable data. </p><p>Amazing technologies arrived in our lives and on the market almost every day. And it will not stop in the coming year. The role of a futurist is certainly not making bold predictions about the future. No such big bet has taken humanity forward. Instead, our job is constantly analysing the trends shaping the future and trying to build bridges between them and what we have today. Still, people expect me to come up with predictions about medical technologies every year, and thus here they are.The top technologies with the biggest promise for 2017 1) A new era in diabetes careIn 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the world's first artificial pancreas[2]. The device monitors blood sugar and supplies insulin automatically. It basically replicates what a healthy version of the organ does on its own; and it enables diabetes patients to live an easier life in a sustainable way. It is the biggest step towards a new are in diabetes management in years The breakthrough happened years after the #wearenotwaiting movement started to campaign for the introduction of such artificial pancreas on the market. One of the leading figures of the movement,\u00a0Dana Lewis also told me how an artificial pancreas eases everyday life[3]. In 2017, this new way of diabetes management will spread around; and it will become a life-changing milestone in many patients' lives when they first start to use the device. The development of diabetes care does not end there. Google\u00a0patented a digital contact lens[4] that can measure blood glucose levels from tears as an added benefit. Google launched a partnership with the pharmaceutical company Novartis; and while there is rather silence around the state of the developments, there are rumors about it becoming available for trials in 2017. 2) Precision medicine in oncologyDigital technology will start the transformation of available cancer care methods on the market. Personalized oncology is becoming available through start-ups and companies such as Foundation Medicine[5] and SmartPatients[6]. Foundation Medicine aims to bring cancer genomics to cancer care. It provides information about patient-specific cancer treatments based on DNA-tests. SmartPatients tries to change cancer care with patient empowerment through an online community. There are significant advances in immunotherapy which might launch a new era of treating cancer. Liquid biopsy was the big thing in 2016 and now it's becoming more accessible for patients worldwide[7]. The technology has limitations, but it's getting better. For example, the blood sample should be obtained before a chemotherapy and it's hard to detect cancer cells. Precision medicine is changing the old model of treating cancer: instead of canons, we start using sniper rifles. 3) Narrow artificial intelligence in US clinics IBM Watson[8], the company's advanced artificial intelligence program is transforming healthcare into a quantifiable service where every bit of information is available. By using it, physicians only have to go through their personalized reports instead of reading through dozens of papers for every patient's case. It has been used in oncology and radiology (Medical Sieve project) so far.\u00a0Although\u00a0recent news about IBM making Watson available widely at US clinics[9] could boost the whole idea of physicians needing help from algorithms. The so-called Watson for Genomics helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumour sequencing. We need to prepare for IBM Watson's broader use[10] in 2017. Although\u00a0it does not answer medical questions[11], but based on patients' data it comes up with the most relevant and likely medical outcomes. However, physicians will make the final call. Computer assistance can only facilitate the work of physicians, it will definitely not replace it. 4) Driverless trucks or cars will include health sensorsIn 2017, we have to prepare for the spread of cars with more and more automated functions. In September,\u00a0Uber started[12] offering rides[13] in self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, a notoriously demanding urban environment. The company teamed up with Volvo to fulfil Uber's objective to replace its more than 1 million human drivers with robots[14] - as quickly as possible. There are already significant results:\u00a0Volvo trucks have gone through Europe already without drivers[15] - how amazing is that! Parallel with striving for the introduction of driverless cars as soon as possible, companies are equipping cars with tons of sensors. As we will spend more passive time in 2017 in these vehicles, Uber, Volvo or Tesla will start implementing health sensors into the driver's seat. I believe that the car itself is going to operate as a point-of-care in the future[16]. 5) New service in nutrigenomicsIn 2014, the FDA clamped down[17] the marketing activities of the biggest provider of genetic tests, 23andMe due to its precautionary concerns. Despite the precedent set by 23andMe, several companies continue to offer and market genetic testing[18] and interpretive analysis without submitting to premarket review by the FDA. Since November 2015, the FDA has sent five 'it has come to our attention' letters to such companies. While the FDA cannot stop companies offering genetic-based services to patients forever, the next 'big deal', namely nutrigenomics, is already knocking on the door. It is going to become a hit in 2017. Nutrigenomics is a brand-new cross-field combining genetics and nutrition science. The basic idea behind nutrigenomics is that our genome reveals valuable information about our organism's needs. We\u00a0should map out this data and utilize in order to lead a long and healthy life. After having your DNA sequenced (perhaps already at home[19]), a smart app could let you know which food you should eat and what you should avoid at all cost. There is already a California-based start-up dealing with nutrigenomics. The inventive company,\u00a0Habit[20] plans to use genetic markers to identify the ideal meal for each of its customers, and send that meal directly to their doors. 6) SpaceX and NASA will realize they need a digital health masterplan to reach MarsIn September, Elon Musk[21], CEO of the SpaceX rocket company aroused hope in astronautics again for the greatest pleasure of the fans of space flights. He promised no less than to take humanity to Mars. I followed Musk's brilliant and inspiring speech online and I got really excited about his vision. His words rang in my head for the next couple of days, and I started to think about the realities of the mission to Mars. I think the biggest obstacle in reaching the Red Planet and installing the conditions of life there is the current state of healthcare. 2017 will be the year when NASA and SpaceX will realize that they not only need a masterplan for revolutionizing the transportation industry and space travel, but also one in digital health[22]. 7) The genome editing method CRISPR in clinical trialsEvery decade or so, there are only a few new ideas that show the potentials of revolutionizing the whole industry of healthcare and pharma. The amazing genome editing method, CRISPR has this potential. Researchers have already used gene-editing to create mosquitoes[23] that are almost entirely resistant to the parasite that causes malaria. Some\u00a0scientists also believe that we will have the chance to edit our cells in our immune systems with CRISPR[24] to improve them against cancer cells and to help them kill these malevolent entities in time. This year,\u00a0experiments also showed how[25] scientists were able to treat mice with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy through gene editing. I believe that in 2017, we have a great chance for launching the first clinical trials to test the real power of CRISPR in changing devastating diseases. 8) A big tech company will step into healthYes, I know, you are right, Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, they all showed interest in medicine and healthcare. However,\u00a0they should step up their efforts[26]. Google has made steps forward in healthcare with Calico[27]. They look for possible 'cures' for ageing and for basically everything which might lead to death. It works together with pharma giant Abbvie to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new therapies. Human Longevity Inc.[28] joined forces with Cleveland Clinic for a human genomics collaboration aimed at disease discovery and making ageing a chronic condition. IBM has been developing its artificial intelligence program, Watson and puts it to use in cardiology and cancer care. There is a harsh race among companies in terms of digital technological development; and its effects are already tangible\u00a0in medicine and healthcare as well. The race will not tone down in 2017, rather on the contrary. A tech giant will announce next year that it will devote significant resources to changing healthcare, a quite undiscovered industry for them. 9) An insurance company launches a wearable sensor package2017 will be the year when the behemoth system of health insurance will start to change with data provided by patients. The hipster insurance company, Oscar Health[29]\u00a0made the first steps already. It has built upon the idea that without quantifying health, insurance is the riskiest business of all. With the help of Oscar Health, insured people can submit their Fitbit data; and if they reach their fitness goals, they get $1 every day. It helps keep people healthy and motivated with a simple but quantifiable reward. I believe that in the future, smoking, drinking heavily, eating trashy food and not doing any sports might not only cost people a lot in terms of their expenses and their health on the long run, but it might also heavily burden their health insurance with extra fees. Due to\u00a0predictions[30], 245 million wearable devices will be sold in 2019. As more and more accurate data sets about our lifestyle through trackers and wearables become available, it is inevitable insurance companies will try to utilize them. In 2017, a large insurance company (not a start-up!) will launch a package containing wearable sensors and guidance about living a healthy life by measuring data in 2017. 10) The surgical robot by Google and Johnson...nson will compete with daVinciSurgical robots have the potential to change how surgeons will operate in the future. The industry is about to boom[31]: by 2020, surgical robotics sales are expected to almost double to $6.4 billion[32]. One fine example is the da Vinci Surgical System[33]. It features a magnified 3D high-definition vision system and tiny wristed instruments that bend and rotate far greater than the human hand. With the da Vinci Surgical System, surgeons operate through just a few small incisions. The surgeon is 100% in control of the robotic system at all times; and he or she is able to carry out more precise operations than previously thought possible. Recently, Google has announced that it started working with the pharma giant Johnson...nson[34] in creating a new surgical robot system. The tech expertise of Google with the healthcare experience of J...ould prove to be a jackpot combination: daVinci will finally have a real competitor. It will definitely give another boost to the surgical robot industry. 11) Vocal biomarkers: the future of diagnostic medicineNot long ago, scientists discovered vocal features in every way imperceptible to humans. They also found that the identification of such distinctive characteristics might have a huge impact on setting up a diagnosis. Researchers labelled these features 'vocal biomarkers'. These can serve as a diagnostic tool for your physician to indicate signs of illnesses ranging from stress and depression to cardiovascular diseases. An earlier diagnosis could essentially be the difference between life and death. The Beyond Health Research platform is analysing such biomarkers[35].\u00a0An Israeli company, Beyond Verbal[36] is launching a platform solely committed to analysing emotions from vocal intonations. Vocal biomarkers will gain ground in 2017. Instead of focusing only on biomarkers measured in blood or genomic markers analysed by geneticists, vocal biomarkers which are easy to detect, record and analyse will be used more and more for detecting and preventing diseases. 12) Pharma will start using massive AI in clinical trials and drug researchClinical trials take a decade and cost billions of dollars[37]. This medical practice has to be changed. The rapid development of artificial intelligence might aid clinical trials. With the help of AI they might require significantly less time and they might be brought closer to the medical institutions and patients themselves. For example the company, Atomwise[38] uses supercomputers that root out therapies from a database of molecular structures. Last year, Atomwise launched a virtual search for safe, existing medicines in order to redesign them\u00a0to treat the Ebola virus. They found two drugs predicted by the company's AI technology which may significantly reduce Ebola infectivity. This analysis, which typically would have taken months or years, was completed in less than one day! 2017 will be the year when the pharma industry realizes they either use AI in drug research and clinical trials or start-ups will make them suffer. When disruption kicks in through a few new technologies, even the giants will have to change their business models 13) A company will make the 3D printed cast a real choiceImagine a scenario where you have broken or twisted a limb, and need a cast[39]. Previously, a messy process of fitting plaster to your hurting body part would be followed by frequent doctor visits to refit the cast as the inflammation subsides or muscles atrophy. Instead, the doctor just scans your arm, prints out a water-proof, lightweight cast in seconds using a software approved by traumatologists, and you're free to go home. At the next visit, your caregiver simply pops it open to examine the injury. Cheaper, faster, more convenient for both patient and doctor. The Spanish 3D printing startup Exovite[40] experimented with the technology, but it seems that they disappeared. Scanning a limb is very simple today. Designing a customized cast is also not rocket science.[41] So what's the main obstacle for applying the above method? The acceptance from traumatologists. That's a hard one. But in 2017, a start-up will finally make it happen.It's important to mention though that none of these will happen without individuals who understand what the technological advances can bring upon as. Those people who discuss the advantages and ethical issues today are the ones who will bring disruption to everyday life tomorrow. Because it's always more important how we adjust to the changes than what developments will take place next year. I hope 2017 will be the year when we acknowledge that a cultural revolution is on the way only triggered by new technologies.

Steven Spielberg was said to be pushing the film Academy to ban from eligibility any movie that premiered on a streaming service rather than in theaters. At the time, Netflix had just won three awards for Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, and the company was forced to defend its Oscars.</p><p>That seemed unfair to Delrahim, 50, who in addition to leading the U.S. Department of Justice's powerful Antitrust Division also happens to be a former movie producer. He says nobody associated with the streaming giant pressured him; he simply felt compelled to do something, so he fired off a letter to Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and warned her that the discussed restriction could amount to a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits \"collusive\" agreements aimed at suppressing competition. Delrahim didn't specify how Oscars eligibility would interfere with the marketplace for movies, although it was fairly clear that he saw Spielberg's effort as part of a plot with greater significance.</p><p>\"I wanted to ensure that a group of the establishment incumbents didn't force changes to those rules to disadvantage potential new distribution models that would harm consumers or filmmakers,\" says Delrahim, speaking in his office at DOJ headquarters in Washington, adding that he was satisfied with the Academy's response. \"Ultimately they kept the existing rules and did not change them to disadvantage Netflix and Amazon or other streaming services. I basically wanted to remind them that the antitrust laws could apply.\"</p><p>As the entertainment industry races to scale itself up to compete with Big Tech, and as Apple, Google and Jeff Bezos' Amazon spend increasingly large sums on premium content, Delrahim has become as potent a business gatekeeper in Washington as anyone not named Donald Trump. He's refereeing mammoth mergers, including the $105 billion tie-up between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, and Walt Disney Co.'s $71 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. He's reevaluating licensing rules that have governed the movie and music businesses for nearly three-quarters of a century. He's even taken an interest in the Writers Guild's nasty fight with talent agencies. Perhaps more than anyone in the Trump administration, his perspective about what's considered anticompetitive (or not) at a transformational moment will shape the future of the content industry.</p><p>ANY CONVERSATION WITH DELRAHIM WILL INCLUDE a lot about Netflix. Given its meteoric growth, that's no surprise. But the company also represents something more to Delrahim, who for a short time dabbled in film and TV production. He cites Netflix repeatedly when explaining his views on entertainment and the recent flurry of moves by the DOJ's Antitrust Division.</p><p>For instance, when Delrahim defends his office's unsuccessful challenge to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, he cites testimony from executives such as Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes, who said that they needed to marry digital distribution with content to glean insights from viewing data and better understand customers in order to stay competitive. \"I don't know if that was correct,\" says Delrahim. \"[Time Warner's] HBO certainly had a [streaming video] product already. Also, Netflix didn't need to own a phone company or satellite company to compete.\"</p><p>Netflix also comes up when Delrahim addresses Disney's recent box office dominance. The company boasted eight of the top 10 performing movies in 2019 and captured 40 percent of domestic market share, yet the DOJ's Antitrust Office swiftly approved its purchase of Fox from Rupert Murdoch. In Delrahim's view, Disney's box office dominance speaks less to the company's aggressive acquisitions (including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm) and more to one studio simply enjoying a winning streak after correctly identifying the pulse of the market.</p><p>\"They should not be punished for making good movies,\" says Delrahim. \"If I did that, I could see [Disney CEO] Bob Iger sitting there saying, 'Wait a minute, we're too successful, guys. Let's not make this next animated film so good.' That's not what antitrust is for. So they own a lot of property and did some brilliant transactions in acquiring them, but there's no guarantee that next year they will also be great, unless they put the effort into it. Any other content creator [can do it]. Again, Netflix. What did they pay for The Irishman? \"</p><p>That would be $160 million, but chances are Delrahim already knows that figure. It's rare for an influential government official to follow the minutiae of the entertainment business, but Delrahim is conversant in showbiz news. It's his informed view of the shifting marketplace--a dynamic one where big isn't inherently bad--that also paved the way for the DOJ's huge recent move to seek the end of the Paramount Consent Decrees, the rules that have governed the relationship between studio distributors and theatrical exhibitors for decades. Those standards came about after the government in the 1940s fought for a place for independents amid corporate tie-ups between studios and theaters, as well as restrictive license agreements. After a landmark Supreme Court ruling, studios were forced to divest their theaters and eschew \"block booking\" (bundling multiple films into one theater license) and \"circuit dealing\" (licensing a film en masse to all movie theaters under common ownership, as opposed to licensing on a theater-by-theater basis). Now, to the chagrin of many in the exhibition community, the DOJ seeks a judge's approval to sunset those banned practices. Says Delrahim, \"There's no reason why antiquated rules from 70 years ago should prevent new business models from existing today.\"</p><p>As Hollywood reckons with potentially sweeping changes at its doorstep, just what kind of regulator is Delrahim? Has the landscape fundamentally shifted as he seems to think? Would the Trump administration, which is already investigating Facebook, Google and other technology companies, ever tolerate a tech giant like Apple or even Netflix swallowing a traditional studio? And how else is the DOj primed to intervene in Hollywood's affairs? Like many things in Trump World, the answers to these questions get a little messy.</p><p>DELRAHIM'S JOURNEY TO HIS SEAT OF POWER begins in Iran, where he was born and where, at age 10, his Jewish family escaped as the shah was toppled by Islamic revolutionaries. He says the experience taught him the value of a government respecting independent thought.</p><p>Settling in Los Angeles, Delrahim became acquainted with entrepreneurship by pumping fuel for customers at his father's gas station. After attending UCLA and law school at George Washington University, he worked a quick stint at a politically connected white-shoe law firm, Patton Boggs, before joining Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who was then the influential chairman of the Judiciary Committee. It was under Hatch's tutelage, and later at the DOJ, where Delrahim found his calling--working on both antitrust issues as well as intellectual property policy. In 2005, he returned to private practice in L.A., where he advocated on behalf of tech companies including Apple, Google and Qualcomm.</p><p>At the same time, Delrahim began dabbling in entertainment. In 2016, he executive produced a horror-comedy film starring Adrian Grenier called Trash Fire, which premiered at Sundance. Working with reality TV powerhouse Pilgrim Films (American Chopper, Ghost Hunter), Delrahim created a pilot for a series about wrongfully convicted individuals. No network picked it up. Delrahim also became a board member for World Poker Tour.</p><p>He dates his interest in showbiz to his time working for Hatch. After gaining exposure to DNA legislation and problems in the criminal justice system, he thought it would make for a good documentary. In fact, he credits himself --probably jokingly, though it's hard to tell when Delrahim is attempting humor--with developing the concept for Making a Murderer before that doc miniseries (on Netflix, of course) came along.</p><p>Those who practice law in antitrust circles say Delrahim is highly intelligent, charismatic and knows everyone who matters. \"I disagree 100 percent on what he is doing on patents, and I believe many consent decrees on the books still make sense,\" says Rutgers law professor Michael Carrier. \"But personally, I like him.\" Adds Richard Hamilton, a partner at Ulmer &amp; Berne who spent two decades in the DOJ's Antitrust Division, \"He's a smart guy, a shrewd guy. He's responsive to public discourse and he's practical.\"</p><p>He's also proved to be quite opportunistic. On March 9, 2016, when it was still not clear that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination for president, Delrahim endorsed Trump in a New York Post column. The move ended up being rewarded. After Trump took office, Delrahim moved his wife and three kids to D.C. to work in the White House counsel's office, where he helped shepherd Neil Gorsuch's successful Supreme Court nomination. In March 2017, Trump nominated him as the nation's top antitrust enforcer; the Senate approved his appointment six months later.</p><p>These days, there are two schools of thought on what antitrust regulators should be doing. The first is a conservative approach where \"consumer welfare\" is the paramount consideration. Heavily indebted to the work of Richard Posner, Robert Bork and the so-called Chicago school of economics, this approach emphasizes high output, low prices and, in general, efficiencies in the marketplace. It's less concerned with ensuring the wide distribution of wealth. It also tends to tolerate consolidation but not naked price fixing.</p><p>The second school is a liberal regulatory approach more concerned with the harm incurred when corporations amass too much power. Under this view, markets are fragile, and smaller businesses deserve greater protection from well-protected oligopolies. In the view of Lina Khan and other scholars in the \"New Brandeis school\" (named for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who once took on industrial magnates like John D. Rockefeller), monopoly laws have been diminished, and what society needs is old-fashioned trust-busting, plus greater attention to predatory pricing, open access to critical infrastructure and healthy labor markets.</p><p>Although Delrahim is closer in ideology to the first school than the second, the truth is that he fits neither rubric neatly. On one hand, he supports the consumer welfare standard. In a June 2018 speech, he connected his parents' emigration from Iran to the dangers of allowing antitrust enforcement to deliberate on what is good and bad for democracy and society at large, adding that \"by giving us focus, the consumer welfare standard reduces the risk of what Brandeis called 'dangers to liberty' from well-meaning enforcers.\" On the other hand, this November at Harvard, where he signaled his office would take a hard look at Big Tech, he said regulators should look beyond what people are paying for products when weighing what companies are doing in the marketplace. Consumer welfare, he noted, could also incorporate \"consumer choice, quality and innovation.\"</p><p>This flexibility invites attacks from both conservative and liberal thinkers and makes it difficult to determine how Delrahim would approach any proposed deal. Take, for example, the DOJ's challenge to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, the first time in decades that the government had sought to block a so-called \"vertical\" merger of companies with complementary, rather than similar, businesses.</p><p>The right criticized him for wandering from the free market dogma. But according to the left, the DOJ was too reliant on economic models in evaluating the deal and was forfeiting an opportunity for a stronger swipe.</p><p>The AT&amp;T-Time Warner case also provided fodder for Delrahim critics who say he lets political calculation and personal ambition guide his decision-making. The Justice Department is supposed to operate independently from the president, yet nearly everyone traced his decision to challenge the merger to Trump's displeasure with Time Warner unit CNN and its leader Jeff Zucker. Even after Delrahim denied the claims in a sworn declaration, the suspicion among many in the legal community remains that Delrahim earned his promotion by committing to challenge AT&amp;T's acquisition in his job interview.</p><p>In addition, the Antitrust Division has in recent months raised eyebrows about politicization of competition law. During the trial of a multistate challenge to the proposed T-Mobile-Sprint merger, which federal regulators approved, text messages emerged that showed Delrahim laboring behind the scenes during the government's review last summer to save a deal that would shrink competitors in the wireless arena, helping to arrange the sale of the two companies' mobile spectrum to a third party, Dish Network, and offering its chairman, Charlie Ergen, advice on how to lobby the FCC and lawmakers. \"Why is the Justice Department Treating T-Mobile Like a Client?\" asked a New York Times editorial in December.</p><p>One observer, suggesting that Delrahim has been using his office to advance personal ambitions, brings up the T-Mobile case and points to how the Antitrust Division has been filing amicus briefs in cases involving Delrahim's former corporate clients. In an important appeal over whether Qualcomm must grant patent licenses to rival chip suppliers, for instance, the DOJ took the side of Delrahim's former top client over the FTC, the other primary antitrust regulator. The Antitrust Division also expressed views favorable to Comcast, another former Delrahim client, about the limited circumstances where a refusal to deal is actionable, in Viamedia's $75 million antitrust lawsuit against the cable giant over advertising spot sales.</p><p>Then there's the DOJ's recent intervention in civil litigation between Hollywood's top talent agencies and the Writers Guild of America. In December, the Antitrust Division not only filed a statement of interest in the case, expressing its view that labor exemptions to antitrust laws should be narrowly applied, but the government also took the rare step of asking for time during a hearing in Los Angeles to argue against the WGA's motion to dismiss. One thing not discussed at the time: One of Delrahim's former clients was Zuffa, former parent company of MMA outfit UFC, which sold a majority stake to Endeavor, the parent of the WME agency, for $4 billion in 2016. (Delrahim says the DOJ monitors all private antitrust lawsuits. He did, however, recuse himself in early February from an investigation into Google after criticism about a conflict with his former client.)</p><p>OF COURSE, it's NOT SURPRISING THAT A Republican-led DOJ would seize an opportunity to thumb its nose at unions. And Delrahim's office has taken on many causes of late with a political tenor--including opening an inquiry into California's deal with automakers to reduce emissions in the wake of the Trump administration's rollback of climate change regulations.</p><p>Regardless of what all of this says about Delrahim's ideology or motivations, it certainly speaks volumes about his assertiveness. \"If you say that I'm more active in some enforcement initiatives than some other past antitrust enforcers, it may well be the case,\" he acknowledges.</p><p>Indeed, the days of sleepy antitrust law where dueling economists slug over the price effects of transactions in the marketplace appear to be finished. The DOJ has asked for a 71 percent increase in funding for the Antitrust Division. Although regulators haven't made a splashy move like attempting to break up Facebook, they have been investigating tech companies since July, and Delrahim has in recent weeks been privately telling interested observers to expect a criminal antitrust case in Silicon Valley sometime in the next few months. On the other side of the aisle, anyone who has listened to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's speeches knows that competition regulation figures to be a key focus in a more liberal administration.</p><p>Hollywood is watching closely because more mergers likely are coming. As new streamers like Disney+, AT&amp;T's HBO Max, AppleTV+ and, soon, Comcast's Peacock seek to scale swiftly to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime, speculation is rife that mid-major studios like Lionsgate, MGM or even Sony Pictures or ViacomCBS will soon be acquired by larger players. This has sparked concerns in the talent community because fewer studios could translate into suppressed wages. A possible WGA strike this summer could hinge in part on these issues. For years, Hollywood labor unions have voiced concerns that antitrust regulators have put consumer welfare above a more comprehensive look at marketplace structure. At the dawn of the streaming wars, some creatives might even be searching for something akin to the old \"fin-syn\" regime, the pre-Reagan administration rules that forbade networks from retaining financial interests in programs they aired. Many recent Hollywood accounting lawsuits--and even the WGA's ongoing battle with talent agencies over their ownership stakes in content--speak to discomfort with the close alignment of the industry's power brokers.</p><p>So what would the DOJ do in the face of another huge proposed merger in the entertainment space? Delrahim is careful about hypotheticals given his office's future role in the review, but Laura Blum-Smith, director of research and public policy at the WGA, worries that regulators aren't prepared to put their foot down. She points to the swift approval of the Disney-Fox merger and an important Jan. 10 document issued by the DOJ. \"Given the opportunity to revise its guidance on vertical mergers, they are giving deference to the notion that vertical mergers can be pro-competitive,\" she says. \"We've amassed so much evidence of the negative impacts from mergers ... I think it's disappointing.\"</p><p>But other observers say not so fast. Hamilton, for one, believes that a merger like Apple-Disney would have \"sailed through five or 10 years ago,\" but after watching the DOJ stand up to AT&amp;T-Time Warner and hearing Delrahim's recent speeches, he's not sure anymore. \"With the new kind of comprehensive view on the consumer welfare model--not just price, but also innovation and quality of services--that's a harder thing to put your thumb on,\" he says.</p><p>Beyond M&amp;A, the entertainment market could be in for more jolts to the status quo thanks to the deregulatory agenda of Delrahim's office. The National Association of Theatre Owners, which represents owners of 33,000 movie screens in the U.S., is sounding the alarm at the move to terminate the Paramount Consent Decrees. In particular, NATO is concerned about block booking and the prospect that studios will use their leverage to force theaters to accept packages of films, including undesirable ones. \"If exhibitors were forced to book out the vast majority of their screens on major studio films for most of the year, this would leave little to no room for important films from smaller studios,\" NATO told the DOJ.</p><p>Delrahim, though, would prefer to see the free market sort this out, and he leans into the possible benefits of fewer rules. For instance, he imagines that Disney could bundle its animation library and work with theaters to screen classics 24/7 with consumers able to purchase a MoviePass-type subscription to family-friendly fare. As to how consumers might be able to enjoy critically acclaimed content if Disney controls most theaters, Delrahim says: \"You could give consumers a tentpole movie to watch--let's say Avatar--but also have a less advertised independent, such as The Hurt Locker, and say if you watch this [Avatar], you'll also get a free ticket to go watch Hurt Locker on Wednesday night. That practice would be arguably prohibited by the Consent Decrees.\"</p><p>If there's one other big thing to know about Delrahim's approach to competition, it's that he's a strong believer in the rights of intellectual property owners to exploit it how they wish. Given that copyrights, trademarks and patents are essentially government-sanctioned monopolies, the interplay between IP and antitrust has long been a topic of debate. That will come into acute focus in the next few months as Delrahim's group wraps up a review of the ASCAP and BMI Consent Decrees. Under these decades-old music licensing rules, the two largest organizations that administer the performance rights of many songwriters and music publishers must offer a blanket license to their repertory of work upon request. If terms can't be agreed upon, music users immediately get access, and a federal court later decides a fair price.</p><p>Ending these rules--or even modifying them--would kick up a litigation and lobbying firestorm. Changes would impact mom-and-pop bars, restaurants, sports stadiums and funeral homes--basically anyone who airs music over loudspeakers. The broadcast industry also cares greatly about this subject; TV and radio owners say they don't have practical control over which music airs on their stations. Modifying the ASCAP and BMI Consent Decrees could raise costs and uncertainties.</p><p>Delrahim cautions that the move to end the Paramount Consent Decrees signals nothing about the future of ASCAP and BMI, but there's a host of reasons to think he's at least ideologically predisposed to reining in the old music licensing rules, too. \"Are those consent decrees actually serving in an anticompetitive manner to prevent new innovation or new licensing?\" he asked rhetorically at a Senate judiciary Hearing in September.</p><p>Should the DOJ move to stir up music licensing, might broadcasters challenge the government in court or sue ASCAP and BMI with fresh antitrust claims? Coordinating efforts (at least blatantly) to stand up to licensing demands is probably out of the question. In December, Delrahim's Antitrust Division expressed its view on the subject in a statement of interest filed in federal court in an antitrust fight between Irving Azoff's Global Music Rights (a new competitor to ASCAP and BMI) and the Radio Music License Committee, which represents some 10,000 radio stations. Supporting GMR, the government said that price fixing by a cartel of buyers in any market is as \"pernicious\" as when sellers do it.</p><p>If music is murky, Delrahim is willing to speak bluntly about a different licensing situation--2019's decision by the major theater chains to shut out Martin Scorsese's The Irishman after Netflix refused to agree to anything beyond a short theatrical run. Could the subject of Netflix and movie theater windows trigger a new antitrust review?</p><p>\"That's an independent decision by the theaters, I assume,\" Delrahim says. \"Look, if the theaters agreed amongst themselves to keep a movie out, that would be a violation of antitrust law. But if they independently, which is what I suspect, decided not to do that because they didn't want to later create the precedent to shorten the window, that is purely a business decision by them. It's not my job to pick winners and losers.\"</p><p>WHAT POLITICAL BIAS?</p><p>Despite complaints from conservatives who say left-leaning tech companies are shadow-banning conservatives from social media, the DOJ won't intervene</p><p>Conservatives are unhappy with Big Tech. Some even accuse social media companies like Twitter and Facebook of suppressing their political viewpoints through \"shadow-banning,\" the act of making certain posts less visible than others. And politicians like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have suggested that the Justice Department should review that supposed censorship. During a Senate hearing in April, Cruz commented, \"By almost any measure, the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil was when it was broken up [in the early 20th century]. They are larger and more powerful than AT&amp;T when it was broken up [in 1982]. If we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to sanction political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.\"</p><p>Asked whether it's the role of antitrust regulators to ensure diversity of viewpoints in social media, DOJ Antitrust Division chief Makan Delrahim is hesitant. \"It's not my job to ensure diversity,\" he says. \"It is my job to ensure that there's competition should there be, in what we call in economic parlance, a revealed preference on behalf of consumers to want that type of diversity.\"</p><p>But Delrahim does imagine a scenario where the DOJ could get involved. \"Obviously, Rupert Murdoch at Fox showed there was a market for half the country who wanted a different viewpoint of news presented to them,\" he says. \"And they did that. Now, if the market was blocked for him to invest and create something that he felt the market needed or demanded, that would be a problem. But otherwise, it's not our job to regulate the content of speech.\"</p><p>Interestingly, his Murdoch comment recalls a nearly forgotten episode a quarter-century ago when Fox News couldn't get on Time Warner Cable and an antitrust suit ensued. Fox News lost. In fact, a judge allowed a countersuit alleging that Fox News conspired with New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani for cable carriage. Eventually, the parties negotiated a settlement.

Dorky tweets. Goofy videos. FCC chair Ajit Pai just wants to be one of the tech nerds. But as a master of Beltway maneuvers, he seems to be trying to destroy everything tech nerds believe in.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">March, Ajit Pai, the 45-year-old chair of the Federal Communications Commission, took to the internet-a community he joyfully inhabits and grudgingly regulates-to pay tribute to his favorite movie. \"It's not just, like, my opinion, man: 20 years ago today, #TheBigLebowski-the greatest film in the history of cinema-was released,\" Pai wrote on Twitter. \"Decades on, the Dude still abides and the movie really ties us all together.\" And sure enough, the response to Pai's cheerful tweet was united.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You're out of your element Ajit.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-@JohnsNotHere</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, Ajit. Stop trying to mingle with humans.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-@Douche_McGraw</emphasis></p><p>I hope you enjoy watching that movie alone since you have zero friends<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-@aseriousmang</emphasis></p><p>No one likes you dork<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-@chessrockwell_</emphasis></p><p>The insults, hundreds upon hundreds of them, accumulated in his replies. Some took the form of incredulous Jeff Bridges GIFs, others mimicked famous lines of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lebowski</emphasis> dialog. (\"Shut the fuck up, Ajit.\") People debated whether Pai was more like one of the movie's nihilist kidnappers or its corporate stooge.</p><p>The competition is stiff, but Pai may be the most reviled man on the internet. He is despised as both a bumbling rube, trying too hard to prove he gets it, and a cunning villain, out to destroy digital freedom. (As one mocking headline put it: \"Ajit Pai will not rest until he has killed The Big Lebowski, too.\") The anger emanates from his move, shortly after being appointed by Donald Trump, to repeal Obama-era net neutrality regulations. He called his policy the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, an Orwellian touch in the view of his critics, who see it as a mortal threat.</p><p>In the simplest terms, the principle of net neutrality prevents internet service providers, such as Verizon or Comcast, from manipulating network traffic for discriminatory purposes. Defenders contend that, without such rules, those companies could exert nefarious powers. They might slow down Netflix, making movies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Big Lebowski</emphasis> unwatchable, in order to push captive subscribers to their own properties, a prospect that becomes more plausible as telecoms like AT&amp;T and Verizon expand into content. They could charge tech companies extra fees to reach customers, giving a competitive advantage to those that pay. They could starve a startup or stifle a voice of dissent. Pai discounted such scenarios, calling them \"hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom,\" and pointed out that there was little evidence of such behavior before the Obama administration imposed the regulations in 2015. But the opposition, drawing energy from the broader anti-Trump resistance, was not persuaded by his reassurances. \"If you're not freaking out about net neutrality right now,\" the activist group Fight for the Future warned its followers last year, \"you're not paying attention.\"</p><p>Pai sought to defuse suspicions by presenting himself as an affable nerd, dropping conspicuous references to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars</emphasis> and comic book heroes. But the internet wasn't buying it. Last May, after satirist John Oliver delivered a scathing monologue ridiculing what he called Pai's \"doofy, 'Hey, I'm just like you guys' persona\"-he focused on Pai's habit of drinking from a giant novelty coffee mug at meetings-and calling on viewers of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Last Week Tonight</emphasis> to stand up for net neutrality, the FCC's website received an onslaught of comments against the repeal. Most simply voiced support for Obama's policy, but some spat racist vitriol at Pai, who is a child of Indian immigrants, or even threatened his life. Trolls tracked down review pages for his wife's medical practice and filled them with abusive one-star reviews. Perhaps unwisely, Pai kept trying to fight back on the internet's own terms. He jousted with celebrities and nobodies on social media. He staged self-conscious stunts, like appearing in a video entitled \"7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality,\" in which he posed as a Jedi and danced to \"Harlem Shake\" with a bunch of young conservatives. But the video just inflamed the internet. On Twitter, Mark Hamill-Luke Skywalker himself-jeered at Pai, calling him \"profoundly unworthy\" to wield a lightsaber. Someone else quickly identified a young woman dancing next to Pai as a right-wing conspiracy theorist who had helped spread \"Pizzagate,\" a hoax scandal from the lunatic fringe that linked Hillary Clinton to a child-abuse ring.</p><p>On December 14, as that spectacle of Pai cavorting with the far right was zipping around the world, the FCC commissioners met to consider the fate of net neutrality. Demonstrators rallied outside the agency's headquarters, but Pai appeared unperturbed as he and his four fellow commissioners filed into a fluorescent-lit chamber. By Washington tradition, the FCC's membership is divided, with two seats picked by the opposition's congressional leaders. His two Republican colleagues spoke in favor of the repeal, while the two Democrats offered harsh dissents. The chair had the final word. \"The internet has enriched my own life immeasurably,\" Pai said. \"In the past few days alone, I've set up a FaceTime call with my parents and kids, downloaded interesting podcasts about blockchain technology, I've ordered a burrito, I've managed my playoff-bound fantasy football team. And-as many of you might have seen-I've tweeted. What is responsible for the phenomenal development of the internet? Well, it certainly wasn't heavy-handed government regulation.\"</p><p>As Pai spoke, there was furtive commotion in the back of the room. A hulking armed guard stepped forward. \"On advice of security, we need to take a brief recess,\" Pai said abruptly, and then stood up and hurried out a side door. A murmur went through the audience: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bomb threat.</emphasis></p><p>The room was evacuated and searched. Eventually everyone returned and Pai called for a vote. The repeal passed, 3-2. Pai took a satisfied sip from his much-maligned coffee mug.</p><p>People who know Pai swear that his nerdy persona is authentic. And even his adversaries will admit that he's an anomaly in the Trump administration: a skillful practitioner of the Washington game. Pai has spent his entire professional life in the capital, acquiring influential patrons (Mitch McConnell, Jeff Sessions) and insider expertise. As Harold Feld, an ardent critic who works for the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, laments, \"Why was my area of policy the one that got the guy who actually knows what he's doing?\"</p><p>Behind Pai's brainy, technocratic mask, though, is an alter ego: ruthless conservative ideologue. In this sense, he is emblematic of Trump's Washington, where all debates-even the bone-dry bureaucratic ones-have become so heated that they are fought like matters of life and death. Pai's competence has allowed him to make quick work of undoing the Obama administration's legacy at the FCC. But his polarizing politics assure that the battle over internet regulation will keep raging. \"I like Ajit Pai personally, although I don't want to defend him in public,\" admits another net neutrality supporter. \"But you're not allowed to try to destroy the internet and then be treated well by the internet. The internet <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">should</emphasis> hate him.\"</p><p>Pai may be a creature of Washington, but he still presents himself as a provincial at heart. He grew up in the small town of Parsons, Kansas, where his parents, both Indian-born doctors, practiced at a county hospital. Pai's connections to the wider world were AM radio and his family's satellite television dish. Today many rural communities are without broadband internet access, an issue Pai often addresses publicly. \"I've been to many, many towns around this country, and I've seen how people are on the wrong side of that digital divide,\" Pai told students at his old high school in Parsons last September. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) He told the assembly about a momentous occasion: meeting Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. \"You walk out and you see the grandeur of the White House and you think about the fact that you just met the most powerful person in the world, and I couldn't help but think about a kid I used to know 30 years before,\" Pai said. \"He was a shy kid, bushy mustache, bushy hair, really awkward talking to people, just didn't quite know what was going on. He was, candidly, a dork.\"</p><p>Pai could argue, though, that dorkiness was his ticket out of Parsons. He was a top-flight debater in high school and, later, at Harvard. He arrived in Cambridge as a Democrat, but under the influence of a professor, Martin Feldstein, who had advised Ronald Reagan, he adopted a conservative free-market philosophy. Pai was also put off by the racial politics on Harvard's campus. After the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles, his residential house invited students to post their feelings on a wall-a literal, brick-and-mortar one. Though a minority himself, Pai was skeptical of liberal identity politics, and he wrote that \"the real problem\" when it came to race at Harvard was \"voluntary segregation.\"</p><p>\"Pai is very much <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">casting his lot</emphasis> with this Trump <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">revolution</emphasis>.\"</p><p>Pai graduated from Harvard in 1994, a year in which two developments emerged that would shape the course of his professional life. That October, Netscape released the first commercially successful web browser, opening the way for the modern internet. A month later, the Republican Party won control of Congress. The spirit of Newt Gingrich's \"Republican Revolution\" was strong at the University of Chicago, where Pai had just started law school. He belonged to the Edmund Burke Society, a vocal conservative group, but also studied with Cass Sunstein, a brilliant liberal scholar of administrative law. (Gigi Sohn-a Democrat and net neutrality advocate who worked at the FCC when Pai was there-told me that after a controversial vote, she saw Pai vehemently arguing with someone who had disparaged his knowledge of administrative law on Twitter. Explaining his anger later, he told her: \"I got an A in Cass Sunstein's administrative law class!\")</p><p>When Pai later moved to Washington, he joined a cohort of young conservatives who were impassioned about curtailing regulation. \"Ajit was a type, as were a lot of his friends from Chicago, that would geek out about the differences in originalist philosophy of Scalia and Thomas,\" says a friend from the time, Ketan Jhaveri. \"And how to use that to get the government to do less.\"</p><p>In 1998, Pai joined the Justice Department as a junior attorney in the antitrust division. He was assigned to a task force overseeing the telecommunications industry, which was going through a period of upheaval. Deregulation had contributed to a boom in dot-com stocks, huge investment in broadband, and a wave of telecom mergers. In 2000, Pai took part in an investigation that eventually blocked the proposed merger of WorldCom and Sprint, partly because it stood to give one company a dominant percentage of the internet's \"backbone\" infrastructure.</p><p>The concern, then as now, was that the company that owned the pipes could also manipulate the flow of data. For practical purposes, some traffic management was essential, but the academics and engineers who pioneered the internet could already foresee how that control could lead to abuses such as blocking access to websites and \"throttling\"-or deliberately slowing-the connections of certain consumers. In 2002, a young law professor named Tim Wu wrote a short paper that he titled \"A Proposal for Network Neutrality.\" He framed the issue in modest terms, suggesting a standard that regulators could use to decide which methods of network management should be permitted (for the valid purpose of directing traffic) and which should be banned (for distorting the fundamental openness of the internet).</p><p>\"I was sure it was a complete waste of time,\" Wu recalls of that paper. But the phrase \"net neutrality\" caught on. Over time the concept has come to mean something far more sweeping, invoked to protect not just bits of data but free speech, personal privacy, innovation, and most every other public good associated with the internet. (Pai has called it \"one of the more seductive marketing slogans that's ever been attached to a public policy issue.\")</p><p>The world of telecommunications law is small, and Wu says he crossed paths with Pai around the time he came up with the concept of net neutrality. \"Back in the day, he used to throw pretty good parties,\" Wu said. Pai was active in the Federalist Society, the intellectual center of the conservative legal scene, but he was a bipartisan networker. He used to arrange large happy hour events, sending out mass email invitations that took the form of clever limericks. \"Everyone knew his politics, but it was kind of like a joke,\" says Jhaveri, who worked with Pai at the Justice Department and is now a tech entrepreneur. \"A lot of our close friends were liberal and would give him a hard time about it, but all in good fun.\"</p><p>After the Justice Department, Pai went to work at Verizon as a corporate attorney, but his foray into the private sector lasted just two years. He went on to Capitol Hill as an aide to two of the most conservative members of the Senate: first Sessions, from Alabama, and then Sam Brownback, who represented Pai's home state of Kansas. Unlike his bosses, Pai was not a fire-breather on social issues, but he could see who was on the ascent in Washington during George W. Bush's presidency. Finally, in 2007, Pai found his natural place at the FCC, taking a midlevel position in the general counsel's office.</p><p>Established in 1934 to oversee radio airwaves and the Bell telephone monopoly, the FCC is one of those government institutions that conceals its importance behind an impenetrable veneer of boringness. The agency has historically had a dynamic of symbiosis-to put it politely-with the companies it oversees. FCC staffers deal mainly with lobbyists, and often become lobbyists, shuttling back and forth between K Street and the \"8th Floor,\" as the commissioners' suites are known in Washington.</p><p>As Pai joined the agency, activism was starting to stir around the issue of net neutrality. On a basic level, the problem concerned an ambiguity in the way the law dealt with internet service providers. The ones that started as phone companies were regulated under Title II of the Telecommunications Act and classified as \"common carriers.\" The cable companies, like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, were governed by the more permissive Title I, which covers \"information services.\" During the Bush administration-after much lobbying, litigation, and a Supreme Court decision-the FCC reclassified all ISPs under the looser designation of information services.</p><p>\"That deal really was: You won't be regulated like a phone company-which they hate, it's very expensive-as long as you invest and serve the country,\" says Michael Powell, Bush's first FCC chair. \"And what did the companies do? Over a decade, it was the fastest-deploying technology in the history of the world. They invested over a trillion dollars.\" Of course, putting broadband in the less regulated category meant the FCC would have fewer powers to police anticompetitive practices. In 2004, Powell, a Republican, set forth voluntary principles. \"It was consciously and purposely meant to be a shot across the bow of the ISP industry,\" Powell says. He was telling them to behave or else the rules could return.</p><p>Powell's approach looked feeble to net neutrality advocates, who were backed by an emerging economic and political force: Silicon Valley. Companies like Google suspected-not unreasonably-that the internet service providers, which had invested all that capital in broadband, resented them for skating on their networks for free. The providers were rumored to be interested in charging tech companies for fast delivery, a practice known as \"paid prioritization,\" and if they started to exploit their middleman position, it could potentially upend the economy of the internet. \"I'm not saying that Google doesn't act out of self-interest,\" says Andrew McLaughlin, who helped start Google's public policy operation in Washington. \"But that self-interest was the sense that the long-term future of the internet is better off if it's free and open.\"</p><p>The new billionaires of Silicon Valley embraced Barack Obama when he ran for president in 2008, as did many of their employees like McLaughlin, who became a White House technology adviser. \"The Democrats won the fight about who was going to hang out with the cool kids,\" says Randy Milch, who was then general counsel at Verizon. \"Then they carried the water for the cool kids. That's how this became a partisan battle.\"</p><p>Obama took up the cause of net neutrality, and his first FCC chairman, Julius Genachowski, cut a deal with the telecom companies to accept new regulations. This incensed congressional Republicans. If Obama favored net neutrality, congressional Republicans were opposed, and the formerly technocratic issue became a right-wing bugaboo. On Fox News, Glenn Beck drew crazed diagrams on his blackboard linking White House aides who favored net neutrality to Marxist academics and Mao. With encouragement from its allies on Capitol Hill, Verizon sued the FCC. This was much to the consternation of the rest of the industry, which considered Genachowski's rules preferable to the hardcore alternative of common-carrier regulation.</p><p>In 2011, when a Republican seat opened up on the FCC, Mitch McConnell put Pai forward for the post. During his confirmation hearing, when Pai was asked about net neutrality, he said he'd keep an open mind as the courts considered Verizon's lawsuit. Net neutrality advocate Harold Feld wrote an approving blog post, calling the nominee a \"workhorse wonk.\"</p><p>\"Boy, was I wrong,\" Feld says today.</p><p>After McConnell and the Republican leadership sent Pai to the commission in 2012, he revealed himself to be a fierce partisan. He reportedly shocked FCC staff with the militantly conservative rhetoric of his very first dissent, over a small-bore decision about the Tennis Channel. Pai went on to clash bitterly with Tom Wheeler, the Democrat who led the FCC during Obama's later years. \"Pai was running circles around him,\" says Craig Aaron, president of the advocacy group Free Press, who watched Pai maneuver in league with Republicans on Capitol Hill. So when a federal court sided with Verizon in early 2014, requiring the FCC to find a new net neutrality approach, Pai was ready. \"He went to war,\" Aaron says.</p><p>The court decision appeared to leave the FCC only one route: classifying service providers under the restrictive rules that covered phone companies as common carriers. This was the outcome the ISPs had dreaded. In 2014, in a move Pai decried as White House meddling, Obama released a YouTube video endorsing this approach. Pai fought against what he called \"President Obama's plan to regulate the internet.\" But the regulations passed, and in June 2016 a court upheld them. The issue looked settled. Then, in a turn no one saw coming, Trump won the presidential election.</p><p>Pai never explicitly identified himself with his party's \"never Trump\" faction, but as an intellectual conservative and the son of immigrants, he has little sympathy for the president's crass nativism, says a friend who talked to him throughout the 2016 campaign. \"I would be very surprised if he voted for Trump,\" this friend added. (An FCC spokesperson says Pai voted for Trump.) Still, when Trump won the election, Pai, like many Republicans in Washington, recalibrated his ideological agenda. \"I knew once Trump met him and heard his life story, Trump was going to like him,\" says Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media and a confidant of the president's. It helped that Pai's old boss Sessions was, at that time, one of Trump's most trusted advisers. When offered the FCC chairship, Pai eagerly accepted the post.</p><p>As the nation's top telecommunications regulator, Pai's unofficial duties include presiding over an annual Chairman's Dinner, also known as the \"telecom prom,\" a Washington hotel gala filled with inside jokes about cable retransmission disputes and the like. In last year's speech, Pai offered tips for his newly powerless Democratic colleagues (\"Tip #1: Leak ... frequently\") and performed a skit in which he poked fun at his own reputation as a corporate shill. It depicted a young Pai, circa 2003, conspiring with a real-life Verizon executive. \"As you know, the FCC is captured by industry, but we think it's not captured enough,\" she said. \"We want to brainwash and groom a Verizon puppet to install as FCC chair. Think <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Manchurian Candidate</emphasis>.\"</p><p>\"That sounds awesome,\" Pai replied enthusiastically. All that was missing was \"a Republican who will be able to win the presidency in 2016 to appoint you FCC chairman,\" the Verizon executive said. \"If only somebody could give us a sign.\" The twangy bass line of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apprentice</emphasis> theme played, and Trump's face filled the screen.</p><p>It is difficult to serve Trump without getting muddied in the mayhem of Trumpism-as Sessions and many others have discovered. Last fall, when Trump launched a Twitter attack on NBC, suggesting it might be \"appropriate to challenge\" its broadcast license for reporting \"Fake News\"-that is, news he didn't like-the FCC chair kept quiet for days before meekly declaring that the FCC would \"stand for the First Amendment.\" Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic commissioner, says: \"Maybe it was fear. But history won't be kind to silence.\"</p><p>For the most part, though, Pai has been left to run the FCC with little interference. Trump may love television, but he doesn't care about the dry arcana of telecommunications regulation. At Pai's sole Oval Office meeting, last March, Trump mainly wanted to talk about winning and their shared love of football, Pai told others, and gushed about the strategy his buddy, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, had employed to stage a Super Bowl comeback against the Falcons. Insofar as the White House has an opinion on net neutrality, it was set early by Steve Bannon, Trump's political adviser, who declared that the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\" would be one of the administration's core priorities.</p><p>\"It was sort of knee-jerk in the White House,\" says a Republican net neutrality supporter who discussed the issue with both Pai and Bannon last year. \"Bannon said, 'This is Obama's rule and we should throw it out.' \" Though Bannon has since been banished, the deregulatory campaign marches on. Beneath the fireworks display of angry tweets, Russia investigations, and sex and corruption scandals, Trump has been filling the judiciary and federal agencies with appointees determined to curtail bureaucratic power.</p><p>Even before he was named chair, Pai said he wanted to take a \"weed whacker\" to FCC regulations, and it was inevitable, given his and his party's hostility to net neutrality, that he would reverse Obama's common-carrier designation. But Pai's order went much further. It allowed ISPs to do what they want with traffic, so long as they disclose it to customers in the fine print, delegating enforcement power to another agency entirely: the Federal Trade Commission. \"I think most people thought he would take the rules and roll them back in a modest way,\" Rosenworcel says. \"This was radical.\" Effectively, he has set the industry free of the FCC.</p><p>Pai has also made decisions favorable to other corporations, like Sinclair Broadcast Group, the owner of nearly 200 local television stations, which is vehemently supportive of Trump's agenda. Among other things, the FCC eased ownership rules that limited Sinclair's growth and is reviewing a controversial merger that would allow it to control another 42 stations, giving it a presence in 70 percent of the US. Progressive priorities, meanwhile, have been slashed. The FCC has moved to curtail Lifeline, a program that subsidizes phone and internet connections for poor people. If the cutbacks go through, some 8 million consumers could lose their Lifeline connections.</p><p>When Trump won the election, Pai, like many <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Republicans</emphasis> in Washington, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">recalibrated</emphasis> his ideological agenda.</p><p>\"Pai is very much casting his lot with this Trump revolution,\" says Aaron of the advocacy group Free Press. Pai has responded to Free Press' net neutrality criticisms by calling the group \"spectacularly misnamed,\" characterizing one of its founders as a radical socialist. He is even more unsparing behind closed doors. A former employee of a public interest group tells of being berated by Pai for an offending press release. \"When you were talking with him privately, he used to seem genuinely interested in understanding,\" says someone who has discussed net neutrality with Pai on several occasions. Now, however, his mind is closed to contrary thoughts. People who work at the FCC say that the agency is roiled by internal conflict. \"It is incredibly partisan,\" Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn told me in December. \"I've been there for almost nine years, and I've never seen it to this degree.\" In April, she resigned.</p><p>Gloria Tristani, a former Democratic FCC commissioner who now represents the National Hispanic Media Coalition, went to visit Pai last June, up on the 8th Floor. Sitting in armchairs in the chair's spacious suite, Tristani tried to broach the subject of net neutrality and the Lifeline cutbacks, but Pai gave her a frosty reception. She says that she tried to be diplomatic, saying that, despite their party differences, she still believed Pai was motivated by his view of the public interest. \"He gets up from his chair, goes to his desk, and comes back with a sheet of paper,\" Tristani recalls. Pai thrust the paper at her. \"He says something to the effect of, 'You really dare say that to me?' \" On the paper was a tweet she had written in favor of net neutrality. Posted beneath it was a picture of Tristani at a protest, pointing toward a \"Save the Internet!\" banner. It was next to a monstrous effigy meant to symbolize corporate money, from which Pai and Trump dangled on puppet strings. (An FCC spokesperson says Pai recalls a less confrontational encounter.)</p><p>Pai's opponents make no apologies for demonizing him, given the stakes they say are involved. Without net neutrality, they predict, consumers could end up paying more money for less bandwidth, while tech companies that have come to depend on fast connections could be faced with a shakedown: Pay up or choke. The service providers scoff, saying they have no incentive to alienate their customers. But if Pai's enemies and allies agree about one thing, it's that his policy aims are about something larger than the speed at which packets of data traverse the cables and switches that make up the physical infrastructure of the internet. \"I don't think this fight is really fundamentally about net neutrality,\" says Berin Szoka, founder of the libertarian advocacy group TechFreedom, who is well acquainted with Pai. \"It's really about people who, on the one hand, want to maximize the government's authority over the internet, versus people who don't trust the government and want to constrain its authority.\"</p><p>A decade from now, it's possible that the net neutrality argument will look like the first skirmish in a much larger conflict-one with shifting alliances and interests. For years, the service providers have been telling Silicon Valley to be careful about what they wished for. Earlier this year, Powell, now the top lobbyist for the cable industry, told me: \"They are going to lose the war, because they are acclimating the world to regulation. They're going to be next.\" And sure enough, over the past few months of scandals over Russian bots and Facebook data-harvesting, and the ensuing congressional hearings, the notion that the government might seek to expand its regulatory purview over Silicon Valley has started to seem conceivable. The tech companies are suddenly friendless in Washington, facing pressure not only from the left, which now sees them as no less evil than the ISPs, but also the right, which complains that its voices are being muffled by speech restrictions.</p><p>It is no coincidence that last year, as the FCC prepared to repeal net neutrality regulations, Silicon Valley's response was notably muted. The conservative antiregulatory ideology might represent the industry's best hope for an escape route for an industry that now fears government constraints. And besides, the big tech companies are no longer so sure that net neutrality is crucial to their business models. Even if service providers start charging tolls, the dominant internet companies will have negotiating power. Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, conceded at an industry conference last year that net neutrality is \"not our primary battle at this point\" because his company is now \"big enough to get the deals we want.\" The demise of the regulation could even have an upside for a now-established incumbent like Netflix, protecting its position from upstart competitors. \"I think there is a growing consensus,\" says analyst Craig Moffett, \"that while it's nice to be able to talk about how an issue like paid prioritization will strangle the next Google before it's born, no one will benefit from strangling the next Google before it's born more than Google.\"</p><p>It is impossible to say whether Pai has killed net neutrality or whether, in the long term, it will return, either through a change of power in Washington, a court decision-appeals are ongoing-or even legislation. It is safe to predict, though, that there will be no peace between Pai and the internet. Over the past year, as he has been parodied and tormented by trolls, Pai has spent a lot of time in real life, on the road, driving rental cars through rural states and promising to bring broadband to the heartland. He has directed billions in funds to close the \"digital divide\" while appointing an advisory committee to identify regulations that slow down deployment. Even on his signature issue, though, there are problems. The committee is stacked to favor corporate interests, critics say, and Pai's choice for its chair, the chief executive of an Alaska telecommunications company, created an embarrassing scandal. She resigned last year and was later arrested on federal fraud charges related to that telecom business.</p><p>Pai says his rural initiative is intended to help neglected consumers, but his barnstorming has led to widespread speculation that he has one eye on Kansas. \"He's probably going to run for Senate one day,\" says Roslyn Layton, a policy expert who dealt with Pai as a member of Trump's FCC transition team. \"He wants to be known as a person from rural America who cares about rural America's concerns.\"</p><p>Still, it's hard to imagine Pai running for office after his recent experience in the fray. He's proven to be a formidable infighter but a maladroit public figure. Though he tries to maintain an indifferent air in public, people who know him say he has been rattled. Jerry Moran, a Republican senator from Kansas, held a small reception for Pai at a Washington townhouse last spring. The attendees were old friends and colleagues, and Pai became emotional. \"He broke down,\" recalls Wayne Gilmore, an optometrist who owns a radio station in Parsons. \"His family was already getting death threats. It was real.\"</p><p>With the darkness, though, comes a bright side: Pai is now viewed as a hero by conservatives. One Friday this past February, Pai went to a convention center outside Washington to deliver a speech to CPAC, an important annual gathering for members of the conservative movement. Out in the corridor, many slim-suited young deplorables with fashy haircuts were milling about, along with a woman costumed as Hillary Clinton in prison stripes. Pai was in the unenviable position of following Trump, who had delivered a rambling stem-winder in which he joked about his hair, maligned the ill John McCain, and talked at length about arming teachers, his response to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, the week before. By the time Pai took the stage for his segment, which was titled \"American Pai: The Courageous Chairman of the FCC,\" the schedule was running around an hour behind.</p><p>Pai walked onstage with Dan Schneider, one of the conference organizers. \"Ajit Pai, as you probably already know, saved the internet,\" Schneider said, by way of introduction, as Pai guffawed appreciatively. \"And he spent a lot of hours preparing a wonderful speech that he's not going to deliver now.\"</p><p>\"OK?\" said Pai, who was carrying a copy of the speech in his inside coat pocket.</p><p>\"As soon as President Trump came into office, President Trump asked Ajit Pai to liberate the internet and give it back to you,\" Schneider went on. \"Ajit Pai is the most courageous, heroic person that I know. He has received countless death threats. His property has been invaded by the George Soros crowd. He has a family, and his family has been abused.\" Then Schneider sprung a surprise. He brought an official from the National Rifle Association onstage. She announced that the NRA, a conference sponsor, was giving Pai an award. \"We cannot bring it onstage,\" she said. \"It's a Kentucky handmade long gun.\"</p><p>\"He broke down. His family was already getting <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">death threats</emphasis>. It was real.\"</p><p>Pai looked dumbfounded. It later emerged that FCC staffers backstage had prevented the NRA from bringing out the \"musket\" for fear of violating ethics regulations-and also, no doubt, wanting to avoid the spectacle of the enemy of net neutrality brandishing a firearm, the week after a deadly school shooting that had ignited massive protests. Friends later said that Pai was enraged that his speech on internet freedom was preempted, but he smiled and gave awkward thanks. Afterward he was ushered downstage for a panel discussion. \"Wow,\" he said, unable to hide his befuddlement. Pai nonetheless managed to hit some of his usual notes, quoting Gandalf the Grey and praising his own decision to take on the interests favoring net neutrality. \"Some people urged me to go for sacrifice bunts and singles,\" he said. \"But I don't play small ball.\"</p><p>Pai had been blocked and throttled, but he was still winning.</p><h>How to Speak Net Neutrality</h><p>Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should not speed up, slow down, or manipulate network traffic for discriminatory purposes. It needs its own glossary.</p><p>Blocking and Throttling<br/>The crudest types of net neutrality violations. Blocking means exactly what it sounds like, while throttling refers to deliberately slowing the flow of data.</p><p>Paid Prioritization<br/>Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize-that is, speed up-the flow of data from certain sites, giving an advantage to companies that pay tolls.</p><p>Title I and Title II<br/>ISPs want to be covered under Title I of the Telecommunications Act, which is fairly lenient. But net neutrality advocates prefer Title II, which would treat ISPs as \"common carriers\" and allow tougher regulation.</p><p>Common Carrier<br/>A legal concept that says certain entities-like railroads and phone companies-are so important that government needs to ensure they are open to everyone equally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANDREW RICE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(@riceid)</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">last wrote for</emphasis> WIRED <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">about architect Bjarke Ingels.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_WI_0618_31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXN-6151-F13F-100Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 26</volume><issueNumber>No. 6</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

in March he publicly chastised the Qantas boss, Alan Joyce, for campaigning against any government support for weaker rival Virgin Australia, which at the time was teetering on the verge of collapse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Just because we're watching has a profound effect, we see that every time,\" Sims tells Guardian Australia.</p><p>\"That will inhibit players taking action to knock off their competitors, but if it doesn't we're here to take action - either under the Act or through recommendations to government.\"</p><p>Sims thinks getting Australia out of the recession caused by the business shutdowns, travel bans and other restrictive measures imposed by authorities to fight the virus will require plenty more government spending - something he is expecting to see in Tuesday's budget.</p><p>At the same time as dealing with the financial effect of the virus, which has crushed an economy that was already struggling with weak growth, Sims and the regulator he chairs, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, are also under heavy fire from Google over his proposal  that it and other digital platforms pay for the news they use on their websites.</p><p>As the pandemic measures ease, Sims will also push the federal government and the states for new powers to go after the big end of town for behaving unfairly towards consumers and small businesses, investigating the opaque market for digital ads, stopping cash-strapped states from striking bad privatisation deals and returning the ACCC to its pre-Covid status of the regulator most hated by the country's business community.</p><p>\"Being the most hated regulator in Australia is a form of praise, there's no doubt about that,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"I think the problem that people have with us is that we actually understand business behaviour and markets too well.\"</p><p>Google and Facebook in ACCC's sights                   </p><p>Right now, the sector that hates Sims the most is big tech - specifically Google and Facebook.</p><p>They are extremely unhappy with the code proposed by the ACCC that would make them pay media companies for the news content they reproduce on their websites.</p><p>Confronted with the prospect of paying what could be hundreds of millions of dollars a year to publishers, Facebook threatened to ban all news content from its site, while Google mounted a public campaign that Sims said contained \"misinformation\" - although he says it falls short of being the kind of misleading or deceptive advertising over which the ACCC can take legal action.</p><p>Google has said it cannot accept the way the ACCC proposes that prices for news be fixed if the two sides cannot agree, a method called \"final offer arbitration\".</p><p>The method, which is sometimes called \"baseball arbitration\" because it is used by the US National Baseball League to strike pay deals for players, involves an arbitrator picking one of the two numbers put forward by each side.</p><p>Sims says he is \"immovable\" on the need for some form of arbitration in the final code - but is less definite about what shape it needed to take.</p><p>\"I've heard their concern about final offer arbitration,\" Sims says.</p><p>But he believes the method could help overcome the information imbalance between news organisations, which don't know how much of their material is being used by the platforms.</p><p>\"You really have to put in a reasonable offer, where if it's normal arbitration you'll put in an ambit claim,\" Sims says.</p><p>Google and Facebook are also in the ACCC's sights over their dominant position in digital advertising, as the controllers of big markets where ad space is bought and sold.</p><p>Sims is concerned that about half the money spent by advertisers never gets to the publisher where the ads run, and is instead gobbled up by intermediaries.</p><p>\"Google is a very large percentage of the demand side and the supply side and all the other intermediaries who are there,\" he says.</p><p>\"It seems hard to justify why such a large chunk goes to intermediaries rather than the ad.\"</p><p>                   'A time of crisis'                   </p><p>Back in the physical world, the ACCC's authorisations of anti-competitive behaviour that have allowed supermarkets to collaborate on supply chains and safety, and banks to agree a common set of hardship standards, are not likely to go away soon.</p><p>\"Yes, things have improved massively, but where will we be in another month?\" he asks.</p><p>\"I guess we feel it's premature to turn them off now ... we'll probably want a longer time to elapse of having Covid under control before doing that.\"</p><p>The authorisations have been \"very successful\", he says.</p><p>\"Normally you want competition to prevail but in a time of crisis we acknowledge that sometimes you can get better results with a bit of coordination - providing people aren't coordinating on prices.\"</p><p>Sims says federal and state governments have so far \"done a very good job\" of supporting demand for goods and services by spending tens of billions of dollars on programs such as jobkeeper.</p><p>\"Certainly a number of businesses I'm aware of have only survived because of jobkeeper,\" he says.</p><p>He is optimistic about the economy once cities are allowed to reopen, but concerned about how many businesses could survive until then in Victoria.</p><p>But he says it is vital to get the health crisis under control first.</p><p>\"There's no point opening a restaurant if nobody wants to go because they're all scared,\" he says.</p><p>\"Once that's all working there may be things to do on the supply side, to help business function and flourish - and obviously fundamental, from our point of view, is making sure there is enough competition.</p><p>\"We are monitoring the banking sector, the financial sector, the energy sector, just to make sure that if companies get in trouble we don't have failures that damage the competition structure of the industry.\"</p><p>                   A Sisyphean task                   </p><p>The ACCC also has a consumer protection role, and there Sims is still pushing for a new law banning unfair practices. Sims - and other regulators - say they have been consistently frustrated by judges taking a narrow view of laws banning unconscionable conduct.</p><p>With Josh Frydenberg this week saying the government will abandon laws designed to protect borrowers by making sure banks lend responsibly, Sims's task might seem Sisyphean - although he does point out that it would also apply to relations between big and small business.</p><p>\"This just comes up all the time where, often, people are taking advantage of their market power,\" Sims says.</p><p>He says the proposed change is being considered by the commonwealth and the states, which have joint responsibility for consumer protection laws.</p><p>\"It's taking a long time but, look, it's a very important change whose time has definitely come,\" he says.</p><p>It's clear Sims sees consumer protection through the lens of misuse of market power - a view that is unsurprising in an economy as concentrated as Australia's, with just two big supermarkets, two big miners and four banks.</p><p>It's even the frame through which he sees one of the ACCC's most vigorously fought campaigns, a battle over the safety of quad bikes.</p><p>The ACCC has spearheaded new rules that require manufacturers to fit an anti-rollover device - often little more than an aluminium rod - to reduce the danger of bikes flipping over.</p><p>The two biggest manufacturers, Yamaha and Polaris, have responded by announcing they will pull out of the Australian market.</p><p>Motorbike dealers are also running a public campaign to get rid of the new rules.</p><p>\"I think the campaign, it's driven by the pursuit of profit, and I guess it is very surprising that profit will be elevated over safety,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"There's too much market power in our economy and it manifests itself in various ways.</p><p>\"You don't get away with that sort of stuff in a competitive market.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-66501007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6106-9R11-DY4H-K05H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1397\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But new reports from the Shorenstein Center and the Center on Equitable Outcomes point to a much more promising approach to reining in the power of big tech companies and creating genuine consumer alternatives. A supervisory agency tasked with using regulatory tools like data portability, data sharing and interoperability to promote competitive alternatives in these sectors might be up to the job.    The  DOJ case  would be standard antitrust fare, alleging that Google has used its monopoly in general search to harm companies seeking to compete with them in the adjacent market for vertical search.  Even if found guilty, the remedy for this would allow the harmful market structure allowing Google\u2019s dominance in general search to persist.  The same is true of proposals to separate platforms and commerce: the dominant platform would continue as a monopolist.    This is consistent with antitrust doctrine as currently understood and practiced according to which monopolies are not the problem.  The key objective of the current antitrust approach is to stop companies from using unfair means to obtain or maintain a monopoly.      But no matter how specific the remedies, enduring monopolies find other ways to exercise their monopoly power to harm consumers and fledgling rivals.  The point of competition policy must be to promote competitive alternatives, not to constrain the conduct of companies with durable monopoly power.        Several years ago, long-time antitrust practitioner and government official Phil Verveer warned against dealing with the problems of tech by bringing another big antitrust case.  Over the summer, he, former Federal Communications Commissioner Tom Wheeler, and consumer advocate and former DOJ official Gene Kimmelman published a  report  for the Shorenstein Center repeating that warning.  The report noted that \u201cit would be a serious mistake to rely on antitrust enforcement as the sole mechanism for securing our society\u2019s interest in the workings of the ever more critical digital platforms.\u201d     The Shorenstein Center report calls for a new regulatory paradigm to protect competition and consumers in digital markets.  It proposes an innovative institutional structure consisting of a new three-person federal regulatory commission called the Digital Platform Agency and a Code Council with equal membership from the industry and the public.  The division of responsibilities - the Code Council drafts \u201cenforceable behavioral rules for the affected companies\u201d and the DPA approves and enforces them - is meant to provide the agility needed for regulation to keep pace with the technological and business developments in a rapidly evolving industry.     It\u2019s dual regulatory structure of a digital platform agency and industry-public code-writing council is focused on remedies aimed at protecting competition including \u201cnon-discrimination, access to data sets, interoperation, and similar requirements designed to lower barriers to competition with the major platforms\u2026\u201d     In calling for a digital platform agency, the Shorenstein report builds on the work of  Jason Furman ,   Harold Feld  and  Fiona Scott Morton , each of whom called for a specialist regulator to deal with the competitive problems raised by digital platforms with strong network effects that seem beyond the reach of traditional antitrust approaches.     Earlier this month, Michael Kades and Fiona Scott Morton issued a  report  through the Washington Center for Equitable Growth that focused on interoperability as one of the tools that such a specialist regulator might use to promote competition to digital platforms.    Interoperability would allow a user of one platform to reach the users of other platforms providing similar services.  It reduces the harmful lock-in that results from network effects by standardizing the service so that platforms compete on price or reliability or other dimensions on quality and cannot dominate the market simply because of the size of their installed customer base.     The authors recognize the key problem is that of supervision and the ongoing need to define what services the competing platforms have to share. They propose that the Federal Trade Commission should use its rulemaking authority to establish an ex ante \u201cdefault order\u201d that would be the basis for an interoperability requirement found necessary by an antitrust court.  They recommend that the FTC set up a \u201ctechnical committee\u201d to establish the crucial details of standardization and implementation in specific cases, outside the adversarial process of an administrative adjudication. The draft order would require industry participants to have a license, which the FTC could revoke, and it would require them to protect the privacy rights of their users in addition to abiding by the interoperability standard.      The remedy has to be triggered by an antitrust court, so the proposal doesn\u2019t avoid the need for big cases to establish liability as the Shorenstein proposal does.  But there are similarities. It seems to me that Shorenstein\u2019s Digital Platform Agency, not the FTC, is the natural home for implementing an interoperability requirement, and its \u201ctechnical committee\u201d does the same work as Shorenstein\u2019s Code Council.  In any case, the work of the agency clearly crosses the line separating a generalist subject-matter agency like the Federal Trade Commission from an industry-specific agency like the Federal Communications Commission. Moreover, the agency\u2019s mandate has to include more than promoting competition if the agency is to deal effectively with the broader privacy and free expression challenges these tech sectors present.     Instilling competition in industries with strong network effects is swimming against the natural current of the market.  Even with herculean efforts, efforts to promote competition might fail, as they did despite the generations-long work to make the telecommunications industry competitive.  But it is worth a shot and the recommendations from Shorenstein and the Center for Equitable Growth show policymakers a reasonable way forward.  It will be interesting to see if the House Antitrust Committee\u2019s upcoming report, in addition to recommending separation of platforms and commerce, adopts this regulatory approach to promoting competition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43209308785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-6581-F07F-82FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1133\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Lately, I've realized that beyond a few major milestones, most people don't really remember Apple as anything but a technology titan. But the two very different Apples of the 1990s and early 2000s are worth remembering, rather than losing them in a hazy muddle that begins with Steve Jobs leaving Apple and ends with the arrival of the App Store.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've tried to categorize the history of Apple into six distinct eras where the company's approach and position were remarkably different, with special attention paid to the two most undersold eras in company history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Hobbyist Era (1976-1982)</p><p>You know the story. Two guys named Steve built a company in a garage in the earliest days of the personal computing. There's been plenty of myth-making about this era in Apple's history, and for good reason. In 1982, high on Apple II sales, Apple hired John Sculley of Pepsi as its CEO, and this era came to an end.</p><p>The Corporate Era (1982-1992)</p><p>This era encompasses the continued success of the Apple II, the release of the Macintosh, and the Mac's growth under Sculley. It's funny to think about how Jobs's legendary shepherding of the original Mac project came as his power base in the company was crumbling, and a year after the Mac arrived, Jobs was gone.</p><p>What remained was a company that was ready to iterate on that original Mac and take it to some great places. The Mac became dominant in media circles thanks to the advent of desktop publishing. My first Mac was an SE, purchased in this period.</p><p>Apple grew a lot during this period, transforming from the legendary garage startup into a more traditional corporation. Microsoft and IBM PCs loomed as threats, but the Mac was still clearly the best choice for the job-and the money flowed.</p><p>The Doom Era (1992-1998)</p><p>I tell people that I started writing about Apple when it was doomed. And indeed, deciding to specialize in Apple computers in 1993 seemed about as smart as covering radio dramas during the roll-out of television. Microsoft was on the march, and the release of Windows 95 massively closed the gap between Macs and PCs, robbing Apple of one of its great advantages.</p><p>The PowerBook, released at the very start of this era, was a winning product that helped earn Apple a lot of goodwill. But that goodwill was rapidly squandered with the disastrous second-generation PowerBook, the 500 series, and its even more disastrous successor, the PowerBook 5300.</p><p>Apple CEO John Sculley was booted during this period, and his replacements got increasingly less inspiring. Apple had a whole lot of money during this period, and not a whole lot of sense, and it flailed around to find a solution that would allow it to become the legendary Apple of the previous era again. It also shot itself in the foot repeatedly, as it did when it licensed Mac OS to outside hardware makers to create Mac clones.</p><p>And just like that, the money ran out. Gil Amelio, the clueless executive left holding the bag, only had a few moves left. Even his single best decision as Apple CEO was a happy accident: Desperate to find a modern operating system because of Apple's inability to build a new version of Mac OS, he ended up getting talked into buying NeXT.</p><p>Yes, NextStep became the foundation of all of Apple's operating systems to this day. But even more important was that the founder of NeXT, Steve Jobs, came along with the purchase.</p><p>The Resurgent Era (1998-2008)</p><p>The popular narrative of Steve Jobs's return to Apple is simple: Jobs came back and saved everything. Which, yes, that did end up happening. But I think it gives short shrift to this very interesting period at Apple, where Jobs was back and putting his plans in motion-but Apple was also hungry to try anything and everything to get back in the game.</p><p>We remember the successes. The original iMac, introduced in 1998, really marks the start of the turnaround. The iPod followed in 2001, and combined with the launch of Apple's retail stores, Apple changed its brand, brought back the Mac, and primed the pump for the launch of the iPhone.</p><p>But there were failures and false starts, too. Apple's partnership with IBM in 2003 led to Apple announcing the Power Mac G5 and Jobs promising a 3GHz processor would be available within a year. IBM was never able to deliver, and Apple ended up having to jettison the entire PowerPC alliance and run into the arms of Intel, formerly Apple's archenemy.</p><p>And in 2002, Jobs stood on stage, mocked Apple's previous efforts to sell server hardware, and explained how Apple would remain committed with the new Xserve server, Xserve RAID storage array, and Mac OS X Server software. It was worth a shot, but it just didn't work out-and both Xserve and Mac OS X Server slowly faded away as Apple found better areas in which to focus.</p><p>And then there were Apple's bumbling attempts to add online services to its portfolio during this period, from .Mac to MobileMe. iCloud has evolved into a solid service, but only after more than a decade of belly flops.</p><p>Yes, there was magic in the early era of Jobs's return. But it was hardly an effortless performance. In this era, Apple was sweating-trying hard, and often, to find places where it could push itself forward. We remember the success, but maybe not the sweat.</p><p>The Era of Expansion (2008-2015)</p><p>Beginning with the launch of the App Store in 2008, this is the era in which Apple went from being a big tech company to being one of the richest and most powerful companies in the world, largely on the growth of the iPhone.</p><p>In this era, Apple introduced the iPad, rapidly advanced iOS against competition from Android, honed its chipmaking skills, and made enormous amounts of cash.</p><p>By 2015, however, iPhone growth began to slow. You can mark the end of the era in 2015 or, if you prefer, 2018. But I'd argue that once iPhone growth slowed to a crawl, the era of Apple's rapid expansion had come to an end.</p><p>The Tech Titan Era (2015-present)</p><p>And then there's the current era, in which Apple is finding growth in new areas beyond the iPhone-most notably wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods) and services. Apple's a gigantic force in the world, the target of regulatory investigations and white papers from politicians who seek to limit its reach.</p><p>Where does the company go from here? It seems like a return to Doom is unlikely, but there's a real question about whether Apple is going to enter a period of senescence, where it makes loads of money but stops growing and changing, or if the corporate culture defined by Steve Jobs drives Apple's current generation toward new products, new categories, and a constant reinvention of what Apple is.</p><p>If I've learned anything in the last 27 years, it's that Apple rarely stands still for very long. Perhaps sometime this decade, Apple will exit its post-iPhone period and enter another exciting new period of growth and change. I sure wouldn't bet against it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCWRLD-3567634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCWRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DK-S9W1-JBP6-P003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1159\"/><timeReceived>04:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.

Sessions will be briefed on September 25 by Republican state attorneys general. Bloomberg reports that Sessions has not yet made his mind up about how to proceed, but that one of the attending attorneys general wants to break up the big tech companies. </p><p>There's a little more insight into US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' cryptic announcement that he planned to discuss[1] whether Silicon Valley firms were stifling free speech and competition. According to Bloomberg[2], Sessions is, as widely speculated, open to the possibility of an investigation into companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Citing two people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Sessions will be briefed on September 25 by Republican state attorneys general who have already been scrutinizing social media firms. Sessions has reportedly not made up his mind yet on an investigation, but at least one attorney general is agitating to break up big tech firms. Sessions announced he was summoning state attorneys general last week over concerns that tech giants may be infringing antitrust and free speech laws. This came after President Trump accused Google of instilling left-wing bias[3] into its search results, and subsequently suggested that giant tech companies could represent a \"very antitrust situation.\"[4] Google dismantled Trump's claims[5], but a chorus of voices on America's right has grown louder in claiming anti-conservative bias in tech. That chorus appears to be echoing all the way to Washington. Neither Trump nor Sessions gave any details of monopolistic practices, but Google was recently fined in Europe[6] thanks to its dominance in mobile and online advertising. Facebook has similarly been criticised for monopolising social media by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.NOW WATCH: How to hack an election, according to a former NSA hacker[7]See Also: Facebook is

Therecent decision[2] by the Trump administration to look into monopolistic practices by the tech oligarchs\u2014talk about collusion!\u2014represents a welcome change from over two decades, under both parties, of sucking up to these firms as they bought up competitors and consolidated market positions that would put the likes of John D. Rockefeller to shame.As in the gilded age a century ago, the tech industry epitomizes capitalism run amok, with huge concentrations of wealth, power, and control over key markets, like search[3] (Google), cellphone operating systems[4] (Apple and Google), and social media[5] (Facebook/Instagram).We have been accustomed to think of technology entrepreneurs as bold, risk-taking individuals who thrive on competition but now we know that it is more accurate to see them as oligarchs ruling over an industry ever more concentrated, centrally controlled and hierarchical. </p><p>Rather than idealistic newcomers, they increasingly reflect the worst of American capitalism\u2014squashing competitors, using indentured servants[6] from abroad, colluding to fix wages[7], and dodging taxes while creating ever more social anomie and alienation[8].The Valley, as one observer[9] puts it, has taken a 'reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage.' That is, while the tech giants peddle the tired meritocratic myth that there's some genius in a garage this close to replacing them\u2014if that genius could still afford a garage in the Bay Area, at least\u2014in fact, they simply buy out or price out new competitors. The industry's influence flourished most under President Obama, where Google's presence, for example, was all but ubiquitous[10], with nearly 250 people shuttling one way or the other between government service and Google employment, and dozens of others going between the search giant and his campaign operations. Needless to say, the search giant had little to fear from corporate lawyer Eric Holder's Justice Department, which was more interested in delivering politically correct homilies than protecting consumers or small businesses through anti-trust actions[11]. ...There is more.The tech industry lost support from the right when it started using its monopolistic power to squash conservative speech. That has happened at both Facebook and Google. The only real question I have is whether breaking them up will open their platforms to free speech by conservatives. That might require regulations and if Democrats came back to power would they use the regulations to suppress speech of conservatives?

Businesses are slipping out of state through those boundaries at an alarming rate because of the difficult conditions lawmakers have forced on them.</p><p><br/>And it seems as if they don't care.<br/>Earlier this year, relocation specialist Joe Vranich released a 623-page report - \"It's Time for Companies to Leave California's Toxic Business Climate\" - which documented 2,183 \"California disinvestment events\" from 2008 to 2016.<br/>\"But it's really worse than that,\" we said at the time. Because, according to Vranich, \"experts in site selection generally agree that at least five events fail to become public knowledge for every one that does.\" A more accurate count, therefore, is about 13,000 disinvestment events over that period.<br/>Then Vranich, who moved his business from Irvine to Pennsylvania, where he can more freely carry on his commercial enterprise, recently told us that \"in just the last three months I've discovered another 32 companies disinvesting in California. In some instances, companies moved multiple facilities out of state, so the number of events is higher at 39.\"<br/>A particularly damaging loss that Vranich hasn't counted yet because the company's decision wasn't announced until late June is\u00a0Mitsubishi's relocation of its North American headquarters\u00a0from Cypress, where it had been since 1988, to\u00a0Nashville, Tennessee, \"joining a migration of Japanese automakers that have exited the Golden State for lower-cost Southern states,\" says the Orange County Register. While the company wanted to be closer to Nissan and Renault,\u00a0its partners which are both in Tennessee,\u00a0the move was motivated by \"cost savings through the business-friendly work environment\" in the state.<br/>So, the flight to freedom continues.<br/>California's economy isn't based on the East German model, but neither is it an economy that works for consumers and businesses. In fact, it's quite hostile to the latter, meaning that it's more than a little unkind to the former.<br/>To understand why businesses are fleeing, look at the comments from business executives who refuse to relocate in or expand to California.<br/>California \"is a tough spot because of all the regulations and red tape. There are so many fees associated with having a business in California for which we didn't get anything in return.\"<br/>\"The infrastructure is horrible, and the cost of travel is higher than any other state.\"<br/>\"Workers comp requirements are high. Insurance liability is way too high.\"<br/>\"Every single thing you can imagine. The red tape and bureaucracy.\"<br/>There are also serious quality-of-life issues. Companies don't want their employees to have to struggle with the state's crippling housing costs, unimaginable traffic, battered roads, man-made drought, and Third World conditions in the state's two biggest cities.<br/>Those refusing to take the business exodus seriously argue that a few departures won't hurt California because it's a big and will always have Silicon Valley anyway. Big Tech won't flee, goes the narrative, because the industry and the state are a perfect match. Yet Vranich tells us that Cupertino-based Apple is among additional the disinvestment events he's recently learned about. One of tech's heaviest hitters, he says, has \"selected Austin, Texas as the location for its new $1 billion, 133-acre corporate campus that will create up to 5,000 new jobs in the short term and add up to 15,000 once the site is built out. The campus expands the Apple footprint in Austin, already its biggest corporate presence outside of Cupertino.\"<br/>No other state treats businesses as roughly as California does. Taxes are onerous, regulations an anchor, economic freedom a fiction, and the legal landscape a snake pit. Chief Executive Magazine has ranked California the worst state in which to do business for 14 straight years.<br/>Maybe the magazine just likes to pick on California. Or maybe, after so many years, it's on to something. That puts it way ahead of the state's nothing-to-see-here political class, which seems to be living in a world far removed from reality.<br/>Kerry Jackson is a fellow with the Center for California Reform at the Pacific Research Institute.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-67564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-1151-F03R-W114-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Pacific Research, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pacific Research Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business Economics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000517</classCode><className>DIVESTITURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X6L</classCode><className>RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001193</classCode><className>TERRITORIAL &amp;

When you grow up with a twin sister, she says, it's just part of the territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before coming to work in her downtown office each morning, Ford wakes up at 4:30 and lifts weights for an hour at Thrive, the Odenton, Md., gym she co-owns with her husband.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Especially as a woman, I really love weightlifting, I love the strength there,\" said Ford, the 40-year-old government affairs chief at First Data, showing off toned bare arms.</p><p>Once she's finished pumping iron, Ford takes the train into Washington and gets to the business of keeping the country's digital economy running, lobbying for a company that most people have never heard of but whose products they have very likely relied on.</p><p>\"Nobody really knows we exist, and yet we have massive computer systems. Anybody who doesn't use cash to pay is interacting with us,\" she says.</p><p>First Data is a payments processor that helps run the financial plumbing people use every time they swipe their credit cards. Banks and retailers rely on their systems to check the purchases people make, approve or deny them and securely relay that information.</p><p>Their system processes some 3,000 transactions every second.</p><p>You've likely used your finger to sign your name at one their Clover terminals, the tablet-as-register system that competes with Square. And you've certainly heard of Western Union, which First Data has owned since 1995.</p><p>Ford sees her job as ensuring that Congress doesn't accidentally shut down the system as it grapples with difficult technological concerns, key among them being privacy, First Data's \"marquee issue.\"</p><p>\"I'm not afraid of consumers having more control over their data, that's absolutely a reasonable expectation,\" Ford told The Hill in a recent interview. \"It's just that there needs to be consideration for those of us that need to access certain types of data to make commerce happen.\"</p><p>An attempt to regulate privacy for a big tech company like Facebook or Google, she fears, could result in regulations that make back-end financial operations much more difficult, even for a company that doesn't concern itself with building user profiles, selling user data or creating targeted ads.</p><p>One example of a tough financial privacy question is whether every company along the chain needs to establish its own consent and terms of agreement if they deal with your data.</p><p>\"Because we're not known to most consumers, if someone has to consent to any use of their personal information, how do we get that consent? We interact with you, but you don't know you're interacting with us,\" Ford said.</p><p>\"These could be very unworkable very quickly.\"</p><p>But Ford said she likes a challenge.</p><p>Growing up in Tampa, Fla., Ford had no interest in politics or policy, even when her ninth grade history teacher, Mr. Bradshaw, told her she could grow up to be mayor and sent her to a mock Congress in Washington.</p><p>Despite her best efforts at orienting her career toward communications, politics pulled her in, first as a PR manager for a local chamber of commerce and then a local builders association.</p><p>\"At that time, I was very local politics, I was county commission meetings, city council, boards \u00af zoning boards, water boards,\" she said.</p><p>That led to a brief stint in then-Sen. Bill Nelson's (D-Fla.) office as a liaison to the business community, which ended when Ford and her first husband moved to Colorado. It was there that she started working for First Data as a lobbyist, initially at the state level and then later in D.C.</p><p>Ford says the experience of getting promoted to the top of the government affairs totem pole from within the company felt like a big accomplishment, given that such positions usually went to veterans of political campaigns who had experience in Washington and political science backgrounds.</p><p>\"I'm kind of an outsider in a way, I didn't do the traditional path,\" she said.</p><p>\"Because I didn't work on the Hill, I couldn't deliver all these relationships,\" she added. \"That's the currency of a lobbyist, is who they can deliver in terms of a vote, and I didn't have that.\"</p><p>But what Ford did have was a strategic view on how to run a multitiered campaign.</p><p>\"I know the strategies at very different levels, because even though a lot of the strategies may be the same for government relations, the local political scene is very different than the state, which is very different from the federal, and you need to have an awareness of those from working in them to understand what can work for you,\" she said.</p><p>Another key, she says, is building trust by providing reliable information.</p><p>\"First Data is a pretty complicated company, and we're not a consumer-facing company, so we've operated behind this shadow of complexity for a long time. I made a concerted effort from day one to really understand the business so that I could be an effective lobbyist,\" Ford said.</p><p>With the 2020 race in full swing and a slew of presidential candidates swearing off corporate money or even refusing to meet with lobbyists, her work may soon get harder.</p><p>\"I totally understand that. I think that lobbying still has a very negative connotation around the world, frankly, and it's something I encounter,\" she said.</p><p>\"You'll talk to a stranger next to you and they'll hear I'm a lobbyist and you can see this hesitation that you get, or even their face twists a little, you know. They get a look on their face!\"</p><p>It's at moments like that in which Ford finds inspiration in her strength training, or her upbringing as a competitive twin sister, or the work she does with her husband on their gym, where she teaches weights and conditioning classes on weekends.</p><p>\"That's perseverance of a sort, and that does translate to wanting to add value, to prove myself,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

For a number of hours on Wednesday and Thursday, Chinese users who tried to access one of the few Western search engines still permitted in their country <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">got only an error message</url> . The site is now back online - but nobody seems willing to say what happened.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Microsoft, which owns Bing, is keeping schtum. When pressed to explain the outage, a spokeswoman would only say: \"We can confirm that Bing was inaccessible in China, but service is now restored.\" No comment was forthcoming from Chinese officials, save a buck-passing statement from the foreign ministry that \"some reports are saying it is due to technical problems\". <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">Bloomberg later reported</url> that \"people familiar with the matter\" were blaming an accidental technical error rather than censorship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, hinted that the outage might pertain to China's internet censorship regime, to which Bing conforms as a condition of operating in the country (it refuses to offer search results for \"Tiananmen Square\" and offers slanted, pro-government results for the Dalai Lama).</p><p>\"This is not the first time it's happened,\" he told a reporter in Davos, explaining that Microsoft frequently has \"difficult negotiations\" with the Chinese government over what subjects it will be forced to censor. These negotiations, he said, were sometimes \"pretty darn direct\", but his company tried to stand up for \"certain principles\".</p><p>Reading between the lines, it seems that some fingers may have slipped inside China's internet censorship apparatus. Or perhaps one of those \"pretty darn direct\" negotiations provoked the government to fire a warning shot, and both sides are making nice in public while they resolve their issues.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless, the suspension made observers jumpy, and with good reason. It underlined how fragile almost any Western tech company's presence in China has now become. With the exception of Apple, whose extensive factory infrastructure on the Chinese mainland would be hard to uproot, Bing was the best model for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">other tech giants such as Google</url> \u00a0(and,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">possibly, Facebook</url> ) who are still trying to get back into China since being kicked out.\u00a0</p><p>But it also shows how fully China has succeeded in building an online industry that requires no input from the titans of Silicon Valley. Never mind former Google chairman Eric Schmidt's prediction last year that the internet will split into two: the truth is that\u00a0the internet has already been broken into pieces, and there is probably no going back.</p><p>That is the conclusion of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">a report published in December</url> by Kieron O'Hara and Dame Wendy Hall, two computer scientists at the University of Southampton. Their argument is that the internet has already split into four different parallel internets, which are \"currently co-existing uneasily\". And as these four internets compete for supremacy, there is no guarantee that the one we use in Britain will be the one that wins.\u00a0</p><p>These internets are not literally separate quite yet. They use the same technological architecture and the same unique-ID system, managed by the US-based non-profit organisation Icann (which was until 2016 ultimately overseen by the US government). In fact, Prof Hall told me on Thursday, China is seeking to change that system. But in the meantime, national governments have found ways to create their own little corners of the net world wide web? (is that accurate?), regulated according to their taste.</p><p>First you have the internet created by US government researchers in the Seventies and expanded by engineers mostly operating in California. Its ethos is utopian and libertarian: everything should be open unless it can be proved to cause harm. Then there is the safety-conscious internet of the European Union, which has erected a giant wall around its users in the form of GDPR. It holds web companies and their decisions to a higher standard of \"virtuous behaviour, civility and prudence\".\u00a0</p><p>Third is the commerce-driven internet espoused by Republican politicians in Washington DC, primarily concerned with private profit (I personally think this is only half an internet, but who's counting). Finally there is Beijing's \"authoritarian internet\": one based on sweeping censorship, mass surveillance and the promotion of domestic tech giants over foreign competitors.</p><p>The crucial thing to understand about the authoritarian internet is that it is not just an ideological project. It is substantially, maybe even primarily, a piece of economic protectionism designed to give China's home-grown web industry a free hand. Companies such as Baidi, Tencent and Alibaba, Hall and O'Hara write, are \"astonishingly successful in their own right, but operating within a tightly controlled environment in which the ruling Communist Party is the dominant player\".\u00a0</p><p>China appears to be following what trade economists call the \"infant industries argument\", which dictates that developing countries should guard sensitive sectors of their economies jealously from foreign investors until they have matured on their own terms.</p><p>\"The Chinese government doesn't have many good reasons to let [American companies] in,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">Matti Littunen of Enders Analysis told me last year</url> . \"It would mean for them a loss of tax revenue, slightly more delicate issues in having control over internet content, and empowering the kind of companies that compete with the likes of Alibaba and Tencent. They've seen what happened in Europe, where other social media companies were able to operate according to their own rules.\"\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">At a glance | Five Chinese internet giants</url></p><p>The world inside that wall is not some staid planned economy, say Hall and O'Hara. It is characterised by \"shaky rule of law, massive consumer scale, extremely changeable demand [and] cut-throat competition\". Celebrity chief executives exert a control over their companies that goes beyond even that of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs. And China is now going through its own debate on privacy and the excesses of Big Tech. Chinese web activists have accused its tech companies of building a series of \"walled gardens\" that try to control every aspect of their users' lives.</p><p>For instance, earlier this week Fang Kecheng, a former journalist,\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">accused Baidu</url>, the dominant search engine, of systematically perverting its search results to prioritise low quality articles from its Baijiahao news service. Bing responded by saying that less than 10 per cent of its search results included Baijiahao links. But 10 per cent is a really high amount! No wonder Mr Fang's article was widely shared on Chinese social media.\u00a0</p><p>China's tech giants won't just stay in China.\u00a0Last year the UN announced that 50 per cent of the world was now online. But the other fifty per cent, said Prof Hall, are mostly in rural China and the Third World, which means they will probably be inducted into China's authoritarian internet rather than\u00a0Silicon Valley's utopian one. \"Large parts of central Africa use Chinese infrastructure,\" she told me, arguing that the Chinese model is more attractive\u00a0to most African regimes, who are worried about civil unrest ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/24/microsofts-bing-blocked-china-tensions-beijing-washington-escalate/\">as well as deadly rumours</url> ) spreading online.</p><p>Chinese venture capitalists are already investing in companies across the world, including in the USA. And Mr Littunen says companies such as Alibaba have a head start in the developing world, with its shaky internet connections and financial networks, because they have had more experience with similar conditions in China than the comparatively coddled Californians.\u00a0So the Communist party has another reason to protect them: they may soon be the dominant players in many other markets.\u00a0</p><p>In time, Prof Hall predicted, we may experience a reversal of the American hegemony which has hitherto governed the internet. For years the USA has been able to spy on the whole world (one might even call it \"mass surveillance\"!) because our communications run through cables and companies inside its borders. Tomorrow, Prof Hall said, \"we will increasingly be using Chinese services and buying Chinese products.. you walk around London, you see the adverts for Huawei.\"\u00a0</p><p>In other words, China has no reason to be merciful to the likes of Bing. Protecting its own tech sector, and its own authoritarian corner of the internet, serves its commercial, ideological and geopolitical goals. Eventually its model of the internet may become the dominant one - at least outside the jurisdiction of Washington and Brussels. In the meantime, Western companies will need to ask very nicely to be let in.</p><p>                     Additional reporting by Margi Murphy in San Francisco and Sophia Yan in Beijing.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51148019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8J-9XJ1-F021-636M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

At a time when many books are exploring ways to make work and business more meaningful in people's lives (a laudable goal), most workers are simply asking that their basic needs be met, and for far too many in our economy, they are not. The wealth is flowing, but it is being dammed up.  WhatJonathan Tepper and Denise Hearn make increasingly clear in their new book,The Myth of Capitalism[2], is that much of the stock market growth and the increase in corporate profits we've seen have come through industry consolidation and economic concentration, and an increasing lack of competition in American business. </p><p>More to the point, it has come on the backs of American workers and consumers. The argument for larger companies is that they create economies of scale that are more efficient. Large mergers are often sold to the public\u2014and specifically to the regulators who are supposed to work in the public's interest\u2014with the promise of cost savings and efficiencies they'll be able to pass onto customers in the form of lower prices. Tim Wu's recent book, The Curse of Bigness[3], which we reviewed here last month, documents just how wrong that idea has been since it was first put forth by Gilded Age robber barons of the past century\u2014and how wrong it still is today.  Tepper and Hearn further that argument by bringing the macroeconomic chops of their independent investment research firm to the issue. The book began as an attempt to figure out why their US Wages Leading Indicator appears to have broken, and why workers wages weren't rising in a time of record corporate profits as they expected (and predicted to clients) they would. What they found is that it could be laid at the feet of industry concentration; that, in fact, 'Record high corporate profit margins are merely the other side of the coin of suppressed wages.' Not only that, but most of our many other economic ills were tied to such economic concentration, as well. At a time of increased wealth and profits, though, we are compelled to ask, as they do: How bad could economic concentration really be for the economy? The damage to the economy is far worse than you might imagine. The evidence is overwhelming that higher economic concentration has created a toxic cocktail of higher prices, less economic dynamism, fewer startups, lower productivity, lower wages, greater economic inequality, and damage to smaller communities.  While they use the word 'monopoly' in the subtitle of the book, it is not quite that simple. The problem of concentration is often overlooked because it is most prevalent today in Monopsonies (industries dominated by one buyer rather than seller), Duopolies (industries dominated by two companies) and Oligopolies (industries dominated by a small number of companies). 'Everywhere we look,' write the authors, 'we see the illusion of competition, but very little of it is real.' The reality is that, as John Stuart Mill wrote, 'Where competitors are so few, they always end by agreeing not to compete.' Worker productivity has been steadily rising for decades, while wages remain stagnant. Meanwhile, CEO pay has skyrocketed. But that is more the symptom of what is wrong rather than the cause of it. The cause, argue the authors, is that 'The boom in mergers and acquisitions over the past 30 years is unprecedented and surpasses the original merger mania at the peak of the Gilded Age when we had robber barons.' If you read Gerald F. Davis's great 2016 book on The Vanishing American Corporation[4], you've encountered just how dramatic the decline of corporations has been, and the effect it has had on the social contract that once existed in the American economy. The numbers Tepper and Hearn relate in this book are stark: Over half of all public firms have disappeared in the past 20 years. Astonishingly, according to a study by Credit Suisse, 'between 1996 and 2016, the number of stocks in the U.S. fell by roughly 50%\u2014from more than 7,300 to fewer than 3,600\u2014while rising by about 50% in other developed nations.' Even as we lionize entrepreneurship, the economy is now producing fewer and fewer new companies. In the boom years of the 1990s there were an average of 436 IPOs per year in the US. In 2016, we saw only 74 IPOs. The great American economic machine is slowly grinding to a halt. In many industries, like big tech, the business model of startups is no longer to compete with existing industry leader, but to be bought out by them. So the companies that remain grow by gobbling up others\u2014and a lion's share of the profit:  In 1995 the top 100 companies accounted for 53% of all income from publicly traded firms, but by 2015, they captured a whopping 84% of all profits. The authors explore how the ways in which business education has contributed to a focus on shareholder returns above all else and teaches business leaders and investors to look for industries with little competition they can dominate. They explain how investment guru Warren Buffett and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, while agreeing on very little, both abhor competition. But the problem isn't necessarily greedy CEOs or a lack of ethics amongst the investor class. It's that 'what is good, right, and logical for the corporation is not good, right, or logical for the economy as a whole.'  Their take on the problem is decidedly nonpartisan, but critical of both the left and the right: When the Left and Right speak of capitalism today, they are telling stories about an imaginary state. The unbridled, competitive free markets the Right cherishes don't exist today. They are a myth.  The Left attacks the grotesque capitalism we see today, as if that were the true manifestation of the essence of capitalism rather than the distorted version it has become. When I think of monopolies, I tend to think of Big Tech, and the authors do spend a good portion of the book dissecting the ways in which it has taken over not only American life, but much of the world. But the data they offer shows that concentration has become prevalent across every industry\u2014from hospitals, cable, and airlines, to concrete and beer. Just four companies have 90 percent of the insurance market. Four corporations control 79 percent of all beef sold. Over 96 percent of chickens are raised under production contracts with large companies like Tyson and Purdue, and the processing plants are placed in areas with few other economic opportunities to keep farmers' options and workers wages low. It is not a pretty scene: Small farmers have to borrow over $1 million secured against their land and house to build farms for Tyson or Purdue. The debt becomes a millstone around their necks, and contractors must keep producing to service the debt. The human cost is high; farmers have been dying from suicide at much higher rates than the average population for many years. Since 1980, 40% of all American cattle farmers and 90% of all hog farmers have gone out of business while the big players have made dozens of billions of dollars in profit. In the 2000s decade, gross income for small and medium-size hog and cattle farmers declined by 32% while 71% of all chicken farmers were estimated to be earning less than the federal poverty line. Things are not much better for the workers on the farms and processing plants. The workers at the four largest US poultry companies are routinely denied bathroom breaks, forcing some to wear adult diapers to work and others to urinate on themselves in order to avoid retribution from supervisors. Such industry concentration also leads to less localism and diversity, and increases the divide between urban and rural economies.  Tepper and Hearn are not calling for increased regulation or taxation as a remedy, though. The authors compare regulation to chemotherapy, helpful in the right doses but deadly if used excessively. They see excessive regulations hurting small and medium sized businesses, while actually protecting big business, which can afford the lawyers and legal regimes needed to meet it. They explain how industry lobbying in Washington and the revolving door between industry and government compound the problem. It is worth remembering that when Adam Smith wrote of 'the invisible hand' in The Wealth of Nations, he was not simply praising the free market, but condemning the government acting on behalf of large merchants who were furthering their own interests.Until lobbying is reformed, there is little hope for reducing the barriers to entry for smaller firms to fight it out in the marketplace. There is little chance the invisible hand can work.  'Government is not a passive bystander in the increase in inequality,' state the authors. 'It is an active participant, granting favors to the wealthy and powerful, looking after the interests of the well connected.' Their answer is 'A stronger democracy by dispersing economic power.' The book contains a history of the antitrust movement and the counterrevolution from the Chicago School that became the ascendant intellectual ideology during the Reagan administration, and has remained so until today. It contains an insightful analysis of industry after industry, and speaks of the concentration of ownership and asset management in the economy. They take Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century [5]to task, while also acknowledging what he got right. 'The problem of inequality is real,' they insist, 'but it is not happening due to low growth' as Piketty argues. The authors argue income inequality is not the cause of political changes, but its consequence. Looking at Piketty's income chart as it correlates with antitrust enforcement, they show clearly how industrial concentration has historically led to income inequality, and how that industrial concentration is as much a political development as an economic one. And they argue that more capitalism through more competition ensured by antitrust enforcement is among the answers\u2014that, in fact, \"Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism.\" I just scratched the surface of the research they provide, and they offer a great list of other \"Principles for Reform,\" \"Solutions and Remedies,\" and things that you can do in the book's Conclusion. There are countless books on innovation. But the best way to ensure it\u2014through competition\u2014is fading, with profoundly negative consequences for the health of the American economy and the American worker. The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition[6] offers a compelling case for why that this is happening, and ideas about what we can do about it.

But with sound bites, much like bumper stickers, there's no room for nuance or scrutiny.The news media has extensively covered the 'questioning' of the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon (collectively 'Big Tech'). Of course, most of this questioning was actually political posturing with little regard for the actual answers or antitrust law. But just like with the so-called robber barons, the story of Big Tech is much more interesting and complex. </p><p>The myth of the robber barons: Market entrepreneurs vs. political entrepreneurs The Robber Barons: The Great American Capitalists, 1861-1901 (1934)[2] by Matthew Josephson, was written in the midst of America's Great Depression. Josephson, a Marxist with sympathies for the Soviet Union, made the case that the 19th century titans of industry were made rich on the backs of the poor during the industrial revolution. This idea that the rich are wealthy due to their robbing of the rest of us is an idea that has long outlived Josephson and Marx down to the present day, as exemplified by the writings of Matt Stoller[3] and the politics of the House Judiciary Committee[4].In his Myth of the Robber Barons[5], Burton Folsom, Jr. makes the case that much of the received wisdom on the great 19th century businessmen is wrong. He distinguishes between the market entrepreneurs, which generated wealth by selling newer, better, or less expensive products on the free market without any government subsidies, and the political entrepreneurs, who became rich primarily by influencing the government to subsidize their businesses, or enacting legislation or regulation that harms their competitors.Folsom narrates the stories of market entrepreneurs, like Thomas Gibbons &amp;#38; Cornelius Vanderbilt (steamships), James Hill (railroads), the Scranton brothers (iron rails), Andrew Carnegie &amp;#38; Charles Schwab (steel), and John D. Rockefeller (oil), who created immense value for consumers by drastically reducing the prices of the goods and services their companies provided. Yes, these men got rich. But the value society received was arguably even greater. Wealth was created because market exchange is a positive-sum game.On the other hand, the political entrepreneurs, like Robert Fulton &amp;#38; Edward Collins (steamships), and Leland Stanford &amp;#38; Henry Villard (railroads), drained societal resources by using taxpayer money to create inefficient monopolies. Because they were not subject to the same market discipline due to their favored position, cutting costs and prices were less important to them than the market entrepreneurs. Their wealth was at the expense of the rest of society, because political exchange is a zero-sum game. Big Tech makes society better off Today's titans of industry, i.e. Big Tech, have created enormous value for society. This is almost impossible to deny, though some try. From zero-priced search on Google, to the convenience and price of products on Amazon, to the nominally free social network(s) of Facebook, to the plethora of options in Apple's App Store, consumers have greatly benefited from Big Tech. Consumers flock to use Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple for a reason: they believe they are getting a great deal.By and large, the techlash comes from 'intellectuals[6]' who think they know better than consumers acting in the marketplace about what is good for them. And as noted by Alec Stapp[7], Americans in opinion polls consistently put a great deal of trust in Big Tech, at least compared to government institutions:One of the basic building blocks of economics is that both parties benefit from voluntary exchanges ex ante, or else they would not be willing to engage in it. The fact that consumers use Big Tech to the extent they do is overwhelming evidence of their value. Obfuscations like 'market power' mislead more than they inform. In the absence of governmental barriers to entry, consumers voluntarily choosing Big Tech does not mean they have power, it means they provide great service.Big Tech companies are run by entrepreneurs who must ultimately answer to consumers. In a market economy, profits are a signal[8] that entrepreneurs have successfully brought value to society. But they are also a signal to potential competitors. If Big Tech companies don't continue to serve the interests of their consumers, they risk losing them to competitors.Big Tech's CEOs seem to get this. For instance, Jeff Bezos' written testimony[9] emphasized the importance of continual innovation at Amazon as a reason for its success:Since our founding, we have strived to maintain a 'Day One' mentality at the company. By that I mean approaching everything we do with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit of Day One. Even though Amazon is a large company, I have always believed that if we commit ourselves to maintaining a Day One mentality as a critical part of our DNA, we can have both the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one.In my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the best way to achieve and maintain Day One vitality. Why? Because customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and a constant desire to delight customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. As a result, by focusing obsessively on customers, we are internally driven to improve our services, add benefits and features, invent new products, lower prices, and speed up shipping times\u2014before we have to. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it. And I could give you many such examples. Not every business takes this customer-first approach, but we do, and it's our greatest strength. The economics of multi-sided platforms: How Big Tech does it Economically speaking, Big Tech companies are (mostly) multi-sided platforms. Multi-sided platforms differ from regular firms in that they have to serve two or more of these distinct types of consumers to generate demand from any of them.Economist David Evans, who has done as much as any to help us understand multi-sided platforms, has identified three different types[10]: Market-Makers enable members of distinct groups to transact with each other. Each member of a group values the service more highly if there are more members of the other group, thereby increasing the likelihood of a match and reducing the time it takes to find an acceptable match. (Amazon and Apple's App Store)Audience-Makers match advertisers to audiences. Advertisers value a service more if there are more members of an audience who will react positively to their messages; audiences value a service more if there is more useful 'content' provided by audience-makers. (Google, especially through YouTube, and Facebook, especially through Instagram)Demand-Coordinators make goods and services that generate indirect network effects across two or more groups. These platforms do not strictly sell 'transactions' like a market maker or 'messages' like an audience-maker; they are a residual category much like irregular verbs - numerous, heterogeneous, and important. Software platforms such as Windows and the Palm OS, payment systems such as credit cards, and mobile telephones are demand coordinators. (Android, iOS) In order to bring value, Big Tech has to consider consumers on all sides of the platform they operate. Sometimes, this means consumers on one side of the platform subsidize the other.For instance, Google doesn't charge its users to use its search engine, YouTube, or Gmail. Instead, companies pay Google to advertise to their users. Similarly, Facebook doesn't charge the users of its social network, advertisers on the other side of the platform subsidize them.As their competitors and critics love to point out, there are some complications in that some platforms also compete in the markets they create. For instance, Apple does place its own apps inits App Store[11], and Amazon[12] does engage in some first-party sales on its platform. But generally speaking, both Apple and Amazon act as matchmakers for exchanges between users and third parties.The difficulty for multi-sided platforms is that they need to balance the interests of each part of the platform in a way that maximizes its value.For Google and Facebook, they need to balance the interests of users and advertisers. In the case of each, this means a free service for users that is subsidized by the advertisers. But the advertisers gain a lot of value by tailoring ads based upon search history, browsing history, and likes and shares. For Apple and Amazon they need to create platforms which are valuable for buyers and sellers, and balance how much first-party competition they want to have before they lose the benefits of third-party sales.There are no easy answers to creating a search engine, a video service, a social network, an App store, or an online marketplace. Everything from moderation practices, to pricing on each side of the platform, to the degree of competition from the platform operators themselves needs to be balanced right or these platforms would lose participants on one side of the platform or the other to competitors. Conclusion Representative Raskin's 'cyber barons' were raked through the mud by Congress. But much like the falsely identified robber barons of the 19th century who were truly market entrepreneurs, the Big Tech companies of today are wrongfully maligned.No one is forcing consumers to use these platforms. The incredible benefits they have brought to society through market processes shows they are not robbing anyone. Instead, they are constantly innovating and attempting to strike a balance between consumers on each side of their platform.The myth of the cyber barons need not live on any longer than last week's farcical antitrust hearing. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20BaronsThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20Baronshttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2Fthe-myth-of-the-cyber-barons%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Cyber%20BaronsThe</url> post The Myth of the Cyber Barons[13] appeared first on Truth on the Market[14].

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech tumble. The NASDAQ index facing a third day of losses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vaccine vow. Global drug makers promise to put safety before speed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a \"Mulan\" misfire. Disney facing criticism over its latest movie release.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Tuesday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Fantastic to have you with us as we turn the calendar and begin the fall season on Wall Street. Let's call it an early fall, too, for tech, as the recent selling pressure we've seen in these names accelerates.</p><p>I'll give you a look. NASDAQ futures off right now by what -- by almost three percent. Wow, that's moving as I speak. We're pretty much at the session lows. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla all sharply lower premarket.</p><p>There's real disappointment, I think, as you can see there for Tesla investors on news it won't be entering the S&amp;P 500 as soon as many had hoped.</p><p>In the meantime, the so-called NASDAQ whale, Softbank belly-flopped again today, falling more than half a percent after Monday's seven percent plunge. Investors worrying, I think that Softbank's risky bets on tech were a driving force in the summer rally.</p><p>The big question is what remains of those bets and what happens if the tech losses that we're seeing in stocks deepen? Either way, the road ahead looks more challenging from here.</p><p>In Washington, Congress back, but there's insufficient urgency on new aid to the unemployed. Political positions remain entrenched and perhaps reinforced by recent jobs data, Friday's data.</p><p>The fact is, better than expected in these numbers can still mean they're dire. The big hope remains a vaccine.</p><p>The biggest biopharma CEOs, as I mentioned there, pledging today to put safety first. All of the details next.</p><p>Here's a quick look, in the meantime, of Asia, that finished higher, but the economic outlook there also remains pretty cloudy.</p><p>Chinese exports, though, a bright spot, up almost 10 percent from last year's levels. Exports meanwhile to the United States actually soared 20 percent. This coming just as President Trump starts discussing a decoupling of the two great nations. He did that yesterday, not what the data suggests.</p><p>As ever, lots to discuss. Let's get to the drivers. Paul La Monica joins us now. Paul, let's talk about stocks first. Are we seeing a healthy, a seemingly called healthy consolidation here for some of the tech names that have done so well this year, or is that pillar perhaps wobbling a little bit more firmly than we'd like?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, that is the big question, Julia. Has this selloff that has taken place in the past couple of days and looks like it will continue today, is it just a reset because maybe the expectations got a little too high and the valuations way too ebullient?</p><p>Or is this a case where we now need to have more than just a correction. Maybe another bear market? I mean, I think a lot of people are stunned by how rapid the recovery in the stock market has been since that big selloff in March when COVID-19 really became a major story in the United States.</p><p>And all of a sudden, investors started to write off concerns about a second wave and what was going to happen to the economy and just got right back into the stock market, and now we're seeing evidence that maybe that rally in tech stocks was a little bit, you know, artificial. It was inflated by Masa Son and Softbank, perhaps.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, fascinating, and of course, stimulus. I think we still underestimate the scale of what the Federal Reserve has done here. They're going to buy more stuff, more assets, including corporate debt of some of the biggest nations in this country.</p><p>More this year than they did in the 12 years following the financial crisis. So, I think this is also something that we have to get a grip on. It also plays into the recovery, Paul. What kind of recovery are we looking at here and should we be talking about more than one recovery?</p><p>The rich are doing okay, the poor are getting crushed.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think you, again, you have to separate the recovery that we have seen in the stock market that may be now stalling from the actual economic recovery and I think when you look at the economy, this does remind me a lot of 2008 and back then, I coined a term called the barbecue recovery, that it was going to be a low and slow, very gradual simmer back in the economy.</p><p>And that's kind of what happened, and I think even though you're seeing, you know, the Atlanta Fed, some estimates that Q3 GDP is going to be, you know, kind of skyrocketing back, it's still going to take a long time for the real economy to reset and get back to where it was pre-COVID.</p><p>And I think a lot of that has to do with many people are out of jobs permanently. Many people are adjusting to the new reality of working from home, especially parents with kids trying to juggle school and work.</p><p>And without a vaccine, I think you're going to have a certain lack of confidence that will persist, and it's going to take some time before we have anything resembling normal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the stop-start recovery, Paul, just adding to the letters, the alphabet soup of potential recoveries, a B and a Q there. Thank you for that Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Great to have you with us.</p><p>All right, President Trump blaming Democrats for the stimulus stalemate. In his Labor Day press conference, the President said he doesn't need to meet with them to simply be turned down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have taken the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road.</p><p>They don't want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that's good for the Democrats.</p><p>But David, that's a bad thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: John Harwood is live in Washington. John, I'd argue there's no moral high road here when millions of people are struggling to pay the bills and feed their families.</p><p>But the problem is the data seems to be entrenching the Republicans on their side and the polls, perhaps, the politics here for the Democrats mean they don't see a reason to negotiate either.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we haven't so far, Julia, seen the real tough economic impact of the lapsing of fiscal support. We have seen job growth slow down over the last couple of months. That's an indication of a wobble in that recovery.</p><p>The President calls it a Super V, but as Paul was just indicating to you, it's more likely to be a longer, slower, more tepid. But in September and October, it is possible that we begin to see the pain of the reduction or the elimination of those Federal unemployment benefits, although the President has taken some limited action to offset that.</p><p>And also, the potential for big layoffs in state and local governments, which are -- saw their revenues collapse over the course of the year. That's the real challenge.</p><p>But when that shows up and whether it shows up in enough time for Congress to make a compromise. Of course, the Democrats in May passed a $3 trillion bill.</p><p>Republicans waited. They were thinking that they didn't need to do anything. Then they came up with a bill that was around a trillion, a little more than a trillion, and the question is, what is the deal space in between there?</p><p>Republicans don't want to spend a lot of that money and the question is, when does President Trump feel the economic heat force them to get back and get closer to the Democratic number? That's when you may get a deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does that happen before the election, John?</p><p>HARWOOD: I wouldn't bet on it at this point. We saw comments from Mitch McConnell the other day saying, I'd like to see another bill, but I wouldn't guarantee one, and that was a sign, to me, I think, that he believe time is running out.</p><p>Obviously, shortly, the Congress is going to have to pass a stopgap funding bill to prevent the government from shutting down. I think they will do that.</p><p>But whether or not they can find somewhere in the $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion range, which would be the midpoint between the two parties' positions is just not clear.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. It means whoever wins the election is going to have a weaker economy to try and pick up the pieces from. John Harwood, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Safety over speed. Nine vaccine developers are making an unusual pledge to uphold what they call high ethical standards when it comes to producing a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Let's get to our senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, who has all the details on this. This is basically some of the biggest pharma CEOs in the world saying we're not going to allow the pressure or the politicization here of regulators because we are not going to ask for approval until we've got the assurance on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Is that right?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Julia, that's right, and actually, it's pretty sad that they feel the need to make this declaration. It's kind of like farmers pledging not to sell sour milk.</p><p>Well, I just sort of assumed that farmers would not sell sour milk. I think we should assume that vaccine makers would not apply to get permission to market a vaccine that has not been shown to be safe and effective.</p><p>So, it is sort of a comment on sort of sorry state of things when they feel compelled to make this pledge. But the reason they do, or one of the reasons they do, is that at least in the United States, the public is just not so enthusiastic about this vaccine.</p><p>There's a lot of hesitation, and these vaccine makers want to sort of buildup confidence in their products.</p><p>[09:10:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that's part of it too, and it feeds into the timing here. We're all desperate for a vaccine, but we have to get the Phase 3 trials, the comprehensive trials, done, and we know that simply getting a broad spectrum of people to enroll in these trials has been a real challenge. And now there's ads focusing on trying to get the minorities on board. Talk us through what we're seeing.</p><p>COHEN: That's right. So, these are ads that are going to start running today in the United States on major networks, as well as networks that are focused on the black and Latino communities, and so what they're trying to do is trying to encourage black people and Latino people to enroll in these clinical trials.</p><p>It's been a real problem. The numbers have not been nearly high enough and they want to encourage more enrollment, because one, you need to test vaccines out on a diverse group so you can see how different groups respond to it.</p><p>But also, Julia, on a more practical level, in order for vaccine trials to work, you have to test the vaccines out in people who are at a high risk for getting -- for coming into contact with COVID-19, and unfortunately, in the U.S., minorities are more than twice as likely to come in contact with COVID-19 than white people.</p><p>So, let's take a look at what the trials are supposed to be doing and what actually is happening. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease doctor in the U.S., he wants 64 percent of the trials to be from minorities, whereas when you look at Moderna, it's only 26 percent; Pfizer, it's only 19 percent. So, it's not nearly as high.</p><p>Now, Dr. Fauci's number is high. It's really kind of aspirational, but you can see they're not even anywhere close.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, that's a huge gap. Let's hope some of these advertising campaigns work.</p><p>Elizabeth, thank you so much for your wisdom as always. Elizabeth Cohen there.</p><p>As we were mentioning there, Pfizer, partnering on their vaccine research with a firm called BioNTech, who seem pretty confident that their vaccine could be ready for approval as early as the middle of October.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen joins us live now from Berlin and he's been speaking to the company's CEO and lead scientist.</p><p>Fred, great to have you with us. There's a huge difference between getting approval and distributing that vaccine, but these guys seem pretty confident.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, they certainly do, and they do say that they think they could do this or could get ready for approval by the middle of October, but they also say that there are some unknowns and interestingly, it ties into exactly what Elizabeth was just saying that obviously right now they are on these very large Phase 3 trials where a lot of people are trying this out -- trying out the vaccine candidate.</p><p>But of course, a lot of people need to be exposed to the coronavirus, and they say they're still collating that data right now and only the moment they have enough people who have been exposed to it and where the virus has been fought off by their vaccine candidate, only then are they going to be able to submit it for approval.</p><p>Now, they say, obviously, they're not going to cut any corners in doing that, and so they say they are aiming right now for the middle of October to put it up for emergency approval. It could possibly be the end of October or the beginning of November, but they have big confidence in their vaccine candidate. Here's what the CEO told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UGUR SAHIN, CEO, BIONTECH: It has an excellent profile, and I consider this vaccine as a vaccine which is near perfect, which has a near perfect profile. We have done preclinical experiments. We have shown that this vaccine is able to protect animals from infection in really tough challenge experiments, and they have, of course, done much more, more testing than we have published so far, and this provides us a lot of confidence in combination with the understanding of the mode of action, in combination with the safety data coming in from the running trial.</p><p>Yes, we believe that we have a safe product and we believe that it will be able to show efficacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: So, you see there, Ugur Sahin, the CEO of BioNTech, a lot of confidence there in the BNT-162 vaccine candidate that they're working on right now and they say or he says if everything goes according to their plan, they aim to be able to produce about 100 million doses of BNT-162 this year, which first and foremost, of course, would go to these high-risk groups like, for instance, medical professionals -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and very quickly, Fred, how long until it's widely available?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, that's the other thing. Obviously, 100 million doses sounds like a lot, but if you look at the world's population, it obviously isn't that much. So, at first, it would be as we said, medical professionals, perhaps elderly people, as well as high-risk groups.</p><p>They say in 2021, they aim to make about 1.3 billion doses and obviously, that's where you're running into some very, very large numbers where this vaccine, then, beginning of next year to the middle of next year, would become or will become widely available to folks in many countries.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fingers crossed. Fred, great work. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. One of the other stories making headlines around the world. Nearly two dozen wildfires are burning across California as we speak. High winds forecast in the coming hours are expected to fuel those flames.</p><p>[09:15:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The most aggressive of those, the Creek Fire remains uncontained. So far, more than 800,000 hectares have been scorched. A Forestry official calling it an unprecedented disaster. Our hearts go out to all those involved.</p><p>There's more FIRST MOVE after this. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where we are bracing for fresh trouble in tech land this morning. NASDAQ futures now off by over three percent after a more than six percent drop between Thursday and Friday last week.</p><p>Market watchers, many of them, at least insisting that as painful as this selloff is, it is nothing more than a healthy consolidation of some of the recent gains.</p><p>The pain, of course, mostly have been focused so far on the handful of NASDAQ stocks that have outperformed the market since the spring.</p><p>One stock, though, bucking the downward trend today, electric truck startup, Nikola. It is soaring almost 30 percent premarket on word that GM is taking an 11 percent stake and partnering on future production.</p><p>All right, the nervousness though spreading elsewhere. Take a look at what we're seeing for the oil markets and for the bond markets too. We've got sizable losses filtering in for Brent and WTI there and a bit of fright to safety here in some of the U.S. Treasuries, the ten-year and the 30-year there. You can see the yields coming down as those prices rise, as investors look for safer assets.</p><p>Ruchir Sharma is Head of Emerging Markets and Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He is also the author of \"The Ten Rules behind Successful Nations,\" and he joins us now from New Delhi.</p><p>Ruchir, fantastic to have you on the show as always. What do you make of what we're seeing here in tech, but more specifically across risk assets?</p><p>RUCHIR SHARMA, HEAD OF EMERGING MARKETS AND CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Well, I think that, you know, we have had this major blow-off in risk assets, as you know, over the last few months, so the fact that we get this sort of period of indigestion is not very surprising.</p><p>For me, the really big rotation will come when we start to see some rise in interest rates. I think that if we begin to see the elongating of the curve begin to rise, then interest rates begin to rise. That's when I think we will have a big problem because the single most important driver of risk assets, of these growth and momentum stocks, has been low interest rates.'</p><p>Now, interest rates have stopped falling, so therefore, I think they've got the spirit of indigestion, but to really sort of feel a major change in the market structure, once you begin to get a rise in interest rates, I think that we could see something much more severe than what we're seeing now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ruchir, when might that come, just given the sheer scale of the buying that the Federal Reserve is doing this year? They seemingly have zero intention of raising rates, so we're talking, then, about the sort of front end of the interest rate curve. It could take years before that kind of threat materializes, surely.</p><p>SHARMA: Well, I think there are two sort of points here. One, I think that as when get more information that we have the vaccine, which is going to lead to sort of mass immunization and herd immunity eventually, I think once we get signs of that and it could -- we have no idea when exactly it will be, but it could be in the next month or two, I think that could be the first sign that at least long-term interest rates begin to rise from the very depressed levels they are now.</p><p>The second big call, and this, I think, is a much longer discussion, is that I think that inflation comes back more quickly than what the market or people in general are expecting.</p><p>For four decades, betting against or betting in favor of rising inflation has been a losing bet, as you know.</p><p>But finally, I think that we will begin to see inflation, given the sheer volume of monetary and fiscal support we're seeing at this time and also some of the very long-term trends that have kept inflation in check such as globalization are now reversing.</p><p>So I think it's a two-step process. Once we seek information on a vaccine, I think the very depressed level of long-term interest rates will snap back up and that causes, some problem I think for growth and momentum stocks.</p><p>And the real churn in the market structure away from this very concentrated rally in growth and momentum and more towards value kind of stocks that happens once interest rates begin to rise because of high inflation.</p><p>And I suspect it is going to happen more quickly than we think, so possibly even as early as next year. So, we could see the reverse of what we're seeing.</p><p>This year, people have been confounded that we have seen such high stock prices even though the economies have been very weak because of the pandemic and that's really happened because interest rates are very low and liquidity is abundant.</p><p>I suspect that next year, we could see the opposite. That the economies come sharply back as the vaccine and the pandemic is behind us, but stocks struggle just because of the incredible support they have gone from liquidity and interest rates and that support goes away next year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, there's still some time between where we are today and, to your point, next year, perhaps, where we see that more dramatic rotation out of these growth stocks. Is what we see today in terms of pullbacks, then, a buying opportunity?</p><p>SHARMA: I think it's very difficult to buy these stocks, especially some of the bigger cap tech stocks just because of the incredible run they have had. You know, this running momentum in growth stocks, the only parallel we have to this is 1999.</p><p>Yes, it is very difficult to know whether we are already in December of '99 or this is still June of '99. That maybe could be the play. That's a very, very hard game for us to sort of call.</p><p>But I don't think that piling on to these stocks at this level is a worthwhile bet. What I think is, yes, there are still opportunities in the growth universe, you know, I've written extensively about some of the gaming companies and also some of the other tech companies on that space.</p><p>But I think, if you had to really start planning for the next three to five years, buying some of the commodity stocks -- and I've been so bearish on commodities for so long, but for the first time I feel that buying some of the commodity stocks on that end of the barbell, I think is more attractive at this stage rather than piling on to these very expensively valued stocks that have had a blow-off and they may still have another three months of spectacular gains to go, but this is very late to be piling on to that corner of the market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, there's so many questions I could ask you here and I have to be careful about timing.</p><p>Gold, then, not a traditional commodity, clearly, but clearly, at the same time, people are investing in gold for many of the things that you have discussed, whether it's concern about lack of control over monetary policy and the implications.</p><p>We've also seen a lot of, particularly Americans, buying into digital assets, cryptocurrencies. What do you make of these two things, Ruchir?</p><p>[09:2:09]</p><p>SHARMA: It's a generational thing. I think some of the older lots are still buying gold and some of the younger ones are -- the millennials are buying more of the Bitcoins and the cryptocurrencies as you put it.</p><p>But generally, I think, what that's telling you is that there is this lingering feeling out there that given what Central Banks are doing in terms of printing so much money, there is a search for alternative assets, so I think that these assets could keep doing well.</p><p>Gold in particular does very well when interest rates adjusted for inflation are negative. And I see that environment carrying on for a while because even when inflation comes back, the Central Banks are going to be much, much behind the curve before they do anything about it.</p><p>So, yes, gold is a very speculative asset. In the long-term, stocks do much better than gold. In fact, I wrote a recent \"New York Times\" article about that, arguing that in the last hundred years, the return on stocks in inflation adjusted terms had been seven percent a year, U.S. stocks that is, and gold has just given one percent or so a year.</p><p>But I still feel in the next three to five years, gold is relatively okay because there is this feeling out there that the Central Banks are printing so much money and we want some safety out there.</p><p>So yes, to have over five percent or so of your portfolio in gold is not a bad idea and if you're a bit more adventurous and I guess, this is more about demographics, then obviously, the search for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, and the other thing, which is there, what's going on in gaming stocks. And I've run out of time, but I am going to get you back because you do have some really pointed, punchy comments to make on this and it ties to some of the big questions about the Big Tech companies and whether they're in trouble with regulators going forward.</p><p>We shall reconvene, my friend. Great to have you on, as always. Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>SHARMA: Thanks, Julia. Always a pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Likewise. The opening bell is next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:03]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE where U.S. stocks are up and running after the long holiday weekend and there's no post Labor Day leap on Wall Street. You are looking at pressure here.</p><p>Tech stocks, tumbling, and testing the 10 percent correction levels once again, so that's a 10 percent pullback from recent highs. Volatility also on the rise. The VIX Volatility Index is up more than 14 percent now to its highest levels since mid-June, often called the fear gauge.</p><p>It's also the price of options, the price of derivatives here, so you have to be careful with how you describe this at the moment given the NASDAQ whale talks.</p><p>Now, the suddenness of the NASDAQ's fall is what matters here, too, having closed at record highs just last Wednesday. The selloff, however, still making only a minor dent in the NASDAQ's more than 20 percent rally so far this year.</p><p>That chart for context is what matters. Tesla shares, meanwhile, also suffering on word late Friday that they won't be entering the S&amp;P 500 any time soon. Investors, of course, have been buying into the stock in anticipation that it might make it in and that would then fuel more buying.</p><p>So some disappointing news there for Tesla fans.</p><p>Disney, meanwhile, facing growing calls for a \"Mulan\" boycott. The newly released film is stirring controversy again after the end credits revealed it was partially filmed in Xinjiang, where China has been accused of mass human rights violations.</p><p>Selina Wang joins us now from Hong Kong. Selina, it was already under some pressure after comments from the lead actress regarding the crackdown in Hong Kong and the pro-democracy protests there. Now, they've got more trouble. Talk us through this.</p><p>SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yet again, and right after its release on Disney Plus, it is facing renewed calls for a boycott. This backlash is tied to the end credits of the film that thanked several Chinese government entities in the western region of Xinjiang. This is where the U.S. has accused China for detaining up to two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.</p><p>China has repeatedly denied those claims, and on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said that they are vocational training centers and they are part of China's counterterrorism efforts. Now, I did speak to an expert at the Asia Society who said the following to me. It is, quote: \" ... deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with and also thank government departments from a region in China that is complicit with genocide.\"</p><p>Now, as you referred to earlier, these are not new calls for boycotts. Last year, the lead actress, Liu Yifei had made some comments supporting the Hong Kong Police during the protests, which led to massive backlash online and from activists.</p><p>Now, China is critical, not only to Disney but also to \"Mulan.\" It's an extremely lucrative market for Hollywood, but it also comes with some compromises including studios having to censor their content, but it was predicted prior to COVID by PwC that China would overtake the U.S. this year to become the world's largest film market.</p><p>When I speak to experts, some of them say that we are coming up against a time where American film studios may need to choose between either servicing the U.S. or the Chinese market, because it's harder to appease both.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you simply can't please both sides here. I guess I will make the point that the film's director, Niki Caro was showing pictures on social media back in 2017 when they were scouting locations and if you think when this was filmed, it was a lot earlier than what we're seeing today and these subjects of the Uyghur Muslims wasn't so front and center.</p><p>I'm not excusing them, but I guess we'll have to make a timing point here. What about people downloading this movie, Selina? What are we seeing? Is this having any kind of suppressive effect?</p><p>WANG: Julia, that is right, but there was evidence when they were scouting these locations that this mass internment was allegedly happening.</p><p>And you're right, the production team have also given some interviews where they have mentioned they spent months scouting potential locations. But there is a little bit of bright news when it comes to those downloads. \"Mulan\" took this very controversial decision to delay the theatrical release and go straight to streaming on Disney Plus.</p><p>According to research from Sensor Tower, the app downloads from September 4th to the 6th jumped 68 percent from a weekend prior, and if we take a look at the consumption, consumer spending in the app, that also spiked nearly 200 percent and that can be attributed to customers paying that $30.00 fee to watch \"Mulan.\"</p><p>Now, the pandemic has prompted these Hollywood studios to look at different types of unconventional release strategy and while this preliminary data looks promising, it is still early to say just how successful this strategy is going to be.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. No judgment yet, but plenty of judgment on the location of this movie. Selina, great to have you with us. Selina Wang reporting there.</p><p>[09:35:13]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, the U.S. travel industry heavyweights have banded together to reboot tourism and inspire Americans.</p><p>Today, they launched a campaign called \"Let's Go There,\" urging us to get on with planning a future trip, even if we don't know when we'll actually be able to do it.</p><p>Joining us now is Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. Roger, great to have you with us. I know this is a culmination of months of work for the travel industry to really understand what the message should be.</p><p>It's a case of balancing safety with survival, really, for the industry. Talk us through it.</p><p>ROGER DOW, PRESIDENT AND CEO, U.S. TRAVEL ASSOCIATION: Well, exactly, Julia. The first thing we had to do as an industry is make sure that health and safety is there.</p><p>So everyone in the industry got together and put out guidance for everything they are doing and right now, being on an airplane is probably safer than being anywhere else. Obviously, more than the grocery store even.</p><p>But once we had that in place, then we had to talk about getting people to plan and think about traveling. We've done a lot of research that shows when people even think about and plan the trip, 97 percent are happier.</p><p>We had to make sure we had the right message. We didn't want to be tone deaf so we had to make sure our message is, when it's time for you, we'll be ready and the whole industry is getting behind this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think also Roger, we have to understand the importance of this as a sector for the U.S. economy. It represents one in 10 American jobs, I believe 35 percent of those have been lost.</p><p>Do you have any sense from those that you speak to in the industry how many of those losses could become permanent job losses?</p><p>DOW: It's very concerning, because as you said, the travel industry represents one in 10 jobs, which is 16 million jobs, eight million have been out of work. I think it's going to come back slowly. Hopefully we'll get at least half of them back by the end of the year.</p><p>But until travel comes back, the economy will not come back. Everything in the economy is tied to someone going somewhere, either leisure, business, or a meeting.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And I think a lot of people will be watching this and going, we understand the importance, we understand the importance to the economy of jobs, but what about for consumers here? We don't really have an industry norm.</p><p>If you book a trip at this stage and then you feel happy about it, you've also got the uncertainty of perhaps having to cancel it in future, will I get my money back? What about insurance? How are you handling that aspect, Roger?</p><p>DOW: I think that's very important. I think the U.S. airlines all made a very smart and bold move last week or two when they said they will not charge change fees anymore. The cruise industry is allowing great flexibility, so therefore, they're seeing bookings for 2021 going way up, and that's very important.</p><p>We can't be tone deaf. We've got to be consumer smart and the consumer has to know, I can book a trip, and if things change, through COVID or my situation, I can change my trip.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, they do. You have to be flexible. Everybody has to be flexible here or this campaign, as positive as perhaps it can be, it simply doesn't work. Roger, I mentioned that this is about Americans traveling domestically. How important was the international tourism and travelers coming to the United States providing the revenues to all of these companies, too? Because that's something that's deeply challenged and will remain so, perhaps, until we get a vaccine.</p><p>DOW: You're absolutely right, Julia. International travel is a huge export for us. When someone buys a trip, it's just like them buying a U.S. computer. It's $250 billion a year and that's basically ground down to zero.</p><p>World Travel and Tourism Council says the U.S. will lose upwards of $200 billion this year, and the reason we like international travel so much is the international visitor stays longer. They stay 16 nights. They spend more. They spend an average of $4,500.00 per person. The Chinese spend almost $7,000.00 per person.</p><p>And it's also great for global understanding. When you travel somewhere, I don't care where it is around the world, you realize people are just like each other anywhere in the world. They care about their family. They care about their children doing better, and they care about seeing new things.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's such a great point. Cultural, better cultural understanding is fostered by international travel, and we lack that right now.</p><p>DOW: Certainly do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Roger, this is clearly a competitive industry. It's always been a competitive industry, and you're pulling together some of the biggest names that are saying, look, we want to work together here to foster greater travel and to encourage people to book trips.</p><p>Once we get through this, does that level of competition return?</p><p>DOW: Absolutely. Right now, the industry is coming together. All the major airlines, American, Delta, and United are on there. The hotel companies, Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, Lowes, American Express, Visa, Chase, even Pepsi- Cola and suppliers, visit California.</p><p>They're all in this together because once people get traveling again, then they can worry about what airline they fly on, where they go and how they pay for it and where they stay.</p><p>[09:40:16]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, if you're trying to encourage people to feel happier and to book trips as a result of this ad campaign, what kind of bargains can they find? How much cheaper are hotel stays, travel in the United States as a result of what we've been through?</p><p>DOW: Right now, there's some great value out there. Both on airlines, hotels, cruise lines, great bargains. They're not going to last long. But on the other side, I'm noticing that, like, beach locations are very popular, are still high price because everyone wants to go to the beaches and the outdoors.</p><p>So, my advice to people is, book that trip now. Think about it. You can always change it. But the bottom line, grab those bargains while they're out there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We'll see, Roger. Are people actually booking cruises?</p><p>DOW: Yes. People are booking cruises for 2021 in great numbers. There's a very loyal group of people who go on cruises, and they understand the cruise ships are as clean and hygiene-specific as they can be.</p><p>Cruise lines have been through many times of things from Legionnaire's disease and things like that and they know what they're doing and they are going to be even better, and the people who are cruisers are saying, I know they're going to have their act together.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, I think there's plenty of people after what we went through in the early stages of the pandemic that will be skeptical, but the hope is that we've learned lessons.</p><p>Roger Dow, fantastic to have you with us. President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</p><p>DOW: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sir, thank you.</p><p>All right, after 15 years at the helm of British Airways and IAG, it is Willie Walsh's final day on the job. He will be succeeded by Iberia's current CEO and Richard Quest, diplomatically suggested to Walsh that he perhaps wasn't the most popular leader the firm's ever had. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, OUTGOING CEO, IAG: But you don't do this job to be popular, you know? And I've always been clear on that. You know, I've realized very early on in my career that if you were to run your business to satisfy the press or to be popular with people, you would go out of business because it's a -- the airline industry is brutally competitive, and to succeed, you have to be prepared to take decisions that are unpopular.</p><p>And I think that's what leadership is about, you know? Good leaders will face up to difficult challenges. I've known lots of people who, when it comes to the crunch, don't like to give bad news and don't like to face difficult decisions.</p><p>I've never had a problem with that, and that may come from my training as a pilot, you know, where you don't have the opportunity to put everything on hold and wait for people to decide what to do. You have to, as a pilot, and particularly as a captain, you have to be ready to make decisions.</p><p>And you know, to assess everything quickly, make decisions in the interest of safety and move on.</p><p>So, you know, I've never sought to be popular, and you know, I'm popular with my friends, but you know, I probably have fewer than most people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Stay with CNN for more of Richard Quest's interview with IAG boss, Willie Walsh. That's coming up on \"Quest Means Business\" at 3:00 p.m. Eastern on CNN.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break, but tough talk from Germany over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. If Russia doesn't investigate, German officials say work on the Nord Stream gas pipeline may come to a halt. Really? Details after the break.</p><p>[09:46:51]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Germany increasing pressure on Russia to investigate the poisoning of the opposition politician, Alexei Navalny. German officials say a pipeline delivering Russian gas to Germany could be halted if Russia doesn't provide answers.'</p><p>The project has been under construction since 2018 and would be very lucrative for Russia, not to mention the German companies have invested in it, too. CNN's John Defterios joins us from Abu Dhabi with more.</p><p>John, what do we make of this? I can't help but feel Angela Merkel, Germany as a nation, too invested this this. It was supposed to be delivering gas as of early next year. Credible threat?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: You know, I'm not sure, Julia, to be honest with you. I see Germany as toughening its stance, right? But whether that translates into a cancellation of the pipeline, I think, is a big stretch.</p><p>If you listen to the language carefully, they're talking about, perhaps, suspending the pipeline right now or freezing operations. Even the Economy Minister today on German radio, Peter Altmaier, was not even supporting sanctions. So this has a long ways to go.</p><p>But one consultant who does energy contracts told me, look, don't bet against politics because things can shift. In this case, we have to follow the project and the money, right? It's better than 90 percent complete, $11 billion on the table. It is being blocked by U.S. sanctions, ironically, that is why they're not seeing gas flowing until 2021.</p><p>But if you look at the five energy companies that are invested in the project, two are German and the others are French, Austrian, and British. So, do they really want to cut out their partners here for the sake of Alexei Navalny. It sounds cynical, but that's the case.</p><p>Then enter Donald Trump into the equation, Julia. He is playing the security card, if you will, NATO, and saying that Russia has way too much influence over the European Union and Germany. Let's take a listen to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: When I came along, I said, wait a minute, we're protecting Germany from Russia, right? NATO. We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy, and the real number is probably 60 percent to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: So, Donald Trump throws out a lot of numbers, as you know, Julia. This time, they're pretty accurate, 30 percent to 40 percent now, although there's no official figures published anymore because of the sensitivities rising to 60 percent to 70 percent.</p><p>What he did leave out here is the primary motivation of the United States, and that is to export U.S. LNG to Europe, coming out of the Gulf of Mexico around Corpus Christi and the Sabine Pass. They have spent billions of dollars building and he is looking for new markets.</p><p>Now, to prevent that penetration by the U.S., gas prong has been cutting prices since 2018 and 2019 to hold on to its market share because Europe is its biggest market, despite the inroads it's made into China.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and of course this pipeline also split opinions in the E.U., too, with nations like Poland saying, why on Earth are we increasing our energy reliance on Russia at a terribly difficult moment?</p><p>But there's more than one pipeline, John, and I need you to explain this. We're talking about Nord Stream 2. What about Nord Stream 1? Because this is what? Ten to fifteen years of history we're talking about between Russia and Germany.</p><p>[09:50:15]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes, great question you're bringing up because it does stretch back to 2005. So, mark that as your suggestion here, 15 years, signed by the predecessor of Angela Merkel, Gerhard Schroder. He's on the Board of Nord Stream. He runs the supervisory board committee as well for shareholders, Julia.</p><p>This is very tightly knit. Even though Angela Merkel has had strained relations with Vladimir Putin, 2015, chaired a panel with them in St. Petersburg in Russia despite those tensions, despite the sanctions by Germany, they still signed Nord Stream 2 at the same time. That's geopolitics.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Contentious as it may be. John, very quickly, what do you think we're seeing in oil?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: We're seeing prices down, Julia, looking now with 6.25 percent, 7.5 percent on WTI. It's not complicated. This is the second wave biting into demand, the fears of it. Already over the weekend, we saw Saudi Aramco cut prices. I have seen in the last hour that Abu Dhabi, ADNOC, the state operator is doing the same. There's real concerns again that the downturn in oil demand is going to continue well through 2021.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that's the message from the markets today. Always simple when you explain it, John. Thank you. John Defterios in Abu Dhabi for us there. Thank you.</p><p>All right. After the break, a healthy pullback or a sign of more trouble to come? The latest on the tech turbulence coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. What a difference a few days can make, at least on Wall Street. The NASDAQ was sitting at record highs less than a week ago. Today, it's down more than three percent and nearing 10 percent correction levels.</p><p>Paul La Monica is back with us. Paul, yes, that's happened very swiftly, but then if I show the chart, year-to-date, context is everything in the grand scheme of things. This index has had a bumpy year.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, without question. I mean, Julia, we have had the NASDAQ plunge along with the rest of the market in March when coronavirus really became reality in the United States, but then we had this rapid recovery.</p><p>You mentioned earlier on the show that the Federal Reserve has come to the rescue many times and I think that coupled with some of the stimulus that we got from Congress and the White House obviously helped restore some confidence in the U.S. economy as well.</p><p>And tech stocks, earnings had been fantastic for the likes of Apple, Amazon, the FAANG companies plus Microsoft and Tesla, and I think that is a reason why techs rallied to the extent they did, but now, you have worries that they went too far too fast, and Masa Son at Softbank is perhaps getting burned and that is a big problem, I think, for the broader market right now.</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a reality check or an unreality check. Before the stock split and I think the reactions to Tesla and Apple there which is completely bonkers, Apple was worth the entire market cap of the Russell 2000. We had Tesla worth the equivalent of Ford, GM, BMW, Volkswagen, Fiat- Chrysler, Toyota, and Honda, and sells less than 10 percent of the cars. Really?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, clearly, the valuations were stretched -- very, very stretched, and I think you can make the reasonable argument that this isn't 2000 all over again because the companies that have led the way up are healthy companies with strong balance sheets for the most part.</p><p>But that still doesn't mean that valuations can't become exorbitant and irrational, which they were.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. I also think that the Fed's move here means that no company is too big to fail here. Every company is too big to fail. Everything will be supported. The question is, can we do the same for consumers?</p><p>Back to our earlier point. Paul, always great to chat to you, thank you so much for that.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Stay safe, and we'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020090801cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-V8K1-JB20-G3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Government, Politics, Health and Medicine, Coronavirus, Entertainment, China, Mulan, Pharmaceutical Industry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541710QQ</classCode><className>MEDICAL RESEARCH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0V</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000770</classCode><className>FUTURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002023</classCode><className>LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

I ll be talking with Anna Wiener about Uncanny Valley, her brilliant new memoir of a life in tech, on February 4th at Manny s in San Francisco. It s our second-ever Interface Live event, and it would mean the world to me if you came to say hello and talk tech and democracy with us. Get your tickets here!</p><p>Last June, after a series of developments related to facial recognition and customer tracking, I warned that a Chinese-style social credit system was beginning to take shape in the United States. Among other things, a school district in western New York announced plans to deploy a facial-recognition system to track students and faculty; the Washington Post reported that airports had accelerated their use of facial-recognition tools, and the United States began requiring visa applicants to submit social media profiles along with their applications.</p><p>That column left open the question of what role American law enforcement might play in building a system that feels increasingly dystopian. But now, thanks to a superb investigation by Kashmir Hill, we know much more. Hill tells the story of Clearview AI, a small and mostly unknown company that has been scraping publicly available images   including billions from Facebook, YouTube, and Venmo profiles   and selling access to the police. She writes:</p><p>Until now, technology that readily identifies everyone based on his or her face has been taboo because of its radical erosion of privacy. Tech companies capable of releasing such a tool have refrained from doing so; in 2011, Google s chairman at the time said it was the one technology the company had held back because it could be used  in a very bad way.  Some large cities, including San Francisco, have barred police from using facial recognition technology.</p><p>But without public scrutiny, more than 600 law enforcement agencies have started using Clearview in the past year, according to the company, which declined to provide a list. The computer code underlying its app, analyzed by The New York Times, includes programming language to pair it with augmented-reality glasses; users would potentially be able to identify every person they saw. The tool could identify activists at a protest or an attractive stranger on the subway, revealing not just their names but where they lived, what they did and whom they knew.</p><p>Hill s report is chockablock with surprising details, and you should read it in full if you haven t already. When it landed online Saturday, it galvanized discussions around how quickly tech companies are eroding privacy protections, with Congress remaining idle so far despite years of discussions around a national privacy law.</p><p>Some threads to pull on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is this legal?</emphasis>As Ben Thompson explains today in a paywalled post, LinkedIn sued a company that had scraped its public profiles in a fashion similar to Clearview. But it lost the lawsuit, seemingly giving a green light to other companies seeking to do the same thing. Last year, Facebook told Congress that it gathers information about logged-out users to prevent this sort of scraping. But former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos explained to me that actually preventing that scraping is much easier said than done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is this the end of privacy</emphasis>? No, because laws protecting individual privacy can still be effective   even at the state level. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Facebook on a case involving the company s use of facial-recognition technology. Facebook used the tech to tag photos with user names, running afoul of an Illinois law requiring companies to get their consent first. As a result, Facebook will likely have to face a multi-billion-dollar class action lawsuit. A strong federal privacy law could make products like Clearview s illegal, or regulate them to offer protections from some of the more obvious ways the technology will be misused.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is our current freak-out about facial recognition ignoring the larger point?</emphasis>Surveying recent municipal efforts to ban use of the technology by law enforcement, Bruce Schneier argues persuasively that we need to take a broader view of the issue. We can be (and increasingly are) tracked in all manner of ways: by heart rate, gait, fingerprints, iris patterns, license plates, health records, and (of course) activity on social networks. The forces working to end individual privacy are a hydra, Schneier argues, and need to be dealt with collectively. He writes:</p><p>The point is that it doesn t matter which technology is used to identify people. That there currently is no comprehensive database of heart beats or gaits doesn t make the technologies that gather them any less effective. And most of the time, it doesn t matter if identification isn t tied to a real name. What s important is that we can be consistently identified over time. We might be completely anonymous in a system that uses unique cookies to track us as we browse the internet, but the same process of correlation and discrimination still occurs. It s the same with faces; we can be tracked as we move around a store or shopping mall, even if that tracking isn t tied to a specific name. And that anonymity is fragile: If we ever order something online with a credit card, or purchase something with a credit card in a store, then suddenly our real names are attached to what was anonymous tracking information.</p><p>Regulating this system means addressing all three steps of the process. A ban on facial recognition won t make any difference if, in response, surveillance systems switch to identifying people by smartphone MAC addresses. The problem is that we are being identified without our knowledge or consent, and society needs rules about when that is permissible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are privacy experts being needlessly alarmist</emphasis>? I try to ration my alarmism judiciously in this newsletter. But once you start looking for examples of companies using their data to build social-credit systems, you find them everywhere. Here, from earlier this month, is a tool Airbnb is developing to evaluate the risks posed by individual risks:</p><p>According to the patent, Airbnb could deploy its software to scan sites including social media for traits such as  conscientiousness and openness  against the usual credit and identity checks and what it describes as  secure third-party databases . Traits such as  neuroticism and involvement in crimes  and  narcissism, Machiavellianism, or psychopathy  are  perceived as untrustworthy .</p><p>Who will this tool discriminate against? And what recourse will those discriminated against have? These are two questions we should take into any discussion of technology like this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finally, is there a good Marxist gloss on all this?</emphasis>Sure. Here s Ben Tarnoff with a provocative piece in The Logic calling for a revival of Luddism to counter oppressive technology of the sort Clearview manufactures. (His piece predates Hill s by a couple days, but the point stands.)</p><p>One can see a similar approach in the emerging movement against facial recognition, as some city governments ban public agencies from using the software. Such campaigns are guided by the belief that certain technologies are too dangerous to exist. They suggest that one solution to what Gandy called the  panoptic sort  is to smash the tools that enable such sorting to take place.</p><p>We might call this the Luddite option, and it s an essential component of any democratic future. The historian David F. Noble once wrote about the importance of perceiving technology  in the present tense.  He praised the Luddites for this reason: the Luddites destroyed textile machinery in nineteenth-century England because they recognized the threat that it posed to their livelihood. They didn t buy into the gospel of technological progress that instructed them to patiently await a better future; rather, they saw what certain technologies were doing to them in the present tense, and took action to stop them. They weren t against technology in the abstract. They were against the relationships of domination that particular technologies enacted. By dismantling those technologies, they also dismantled those relationships   and forced the creation of new ones, from below.</p><p>Last June, writing about the rise of American social credit systems, I noted that they were developing with very little public conversation about them. The good news is that the public conversation has now begun. The question is whether advocates for civil liberties will be able to sustain that conversation   or to turn it into action.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis>European businesses say that using<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>apps helped them generate sales corresponding to an estimated EUR 208 billion last year, which translates to about 3.1 million jobs.

For a layman, AI is simply an ability of a computer program to mimic 'cognitive' functions performed by humans in real life such as learning and problem solving.  Artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types of systems: (i) analytical, (ii) human-inspired, and (iii) humanized artificial intelligence. Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence; generating cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions. </p><p>Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive and emotional intelligence; understanding human emotions, in addition to cognitive elements, and considering them in their decision making. Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence), can be self-conscious and is self-aware in interactions with others. According to World Economic Forum, 'The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence[1].' Since average smartphones/computers/devices have millions of times better computing power than used in the Apollo space mission, the AI today is capable of learning on its own which is of a big concern, in fact, quite terrifying to some. This raises concerns for safety and security of mankind, if gone out of hand (remember Rajnikant starrer Robot and 2.0?). Also, majority of the big tech companies are using utilities of AI such a 'Machine Learning' to progress and control traffic on their social media platforms and 'Facial Recognition' to unlock devices. Such information may at times be fragile enough to cause damage to millions of people. To add to such concerns, most of the tech giants are accused of selling access of such unregulated data to third-parties. The direct risks arising from AI include autonomous weapons, social manipulation, invasion of privacy and social grading, misalignment between our goals and the machine's and discrimination.[2]Applications of Artificial IntelligenceThe boom of artificial intelligence is already here and is trending in various sectors due to its broad applications and ease of use. Some examples are mentioned as under. Medical Data scientists use machine learning to manipulate data and to create algorithms that can trace patterns and apply logic faster and more efficiently. Social Media and Online Services AI is being widely deployed in the form of tracking user activity to provide better recommendations in the form of content and ads by services like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and YouTube (Google). This saves hours of standard scraping and analysis of data by managers due to its autonomous/unmanned nature. Finance Fintech is being boosted using AI, since it gets the job done quickly and is accurate with the numbers. B2C services like customer calls are now being shifted to AI in the form of chatbots to guide the customers and get done with the issue faster. Data Security Activity on the internet can be easily traced with AI since it monitors every user interaction. Such tracking can help predict and prevent illicit logins and bank transactions which minimizes online hacking.Legal Implications of Artificial IntelligenceIndia is a developing tech market with a growing popularity for AI, and without proper regulations and norms, it can be quite chaotic and unmanageable. The Government of India is looking to regulate artificial intelligence (AI), with a clear set of guidelines for how the AI technology is developed and implemented. This was confirmed by Suresh Prabhu, previous Minister of Commerce ...dustry and Civil Aviation, who said, 'Ideas and Technologies have a broader impact in today's society and it must be governed and guided by ethics for a better tomorrow.[3]' However, sometimes the government can be over-reactive and over-reaching. A latest amendment bill for the IT Act attempts to censor and increase government control of the Internet is considered as non-democratic by several concerned quarters. However, the government should focus on bringing about amendments relevant to AI and its use since such powerful technology is always disruptive whenever in hands of wrong people. A new approach of creating AI-laws can be the development of a new individual IT-AI cell which would be responsible for keeping an eye on the activities of data movement on a regular period and registered corporations using AI must share their algorithms with such cell, so that the cell may determine the nature of AI and whether it's harmful or not. It's like the Income Tax department, capable of viewing the monetary transactions of a person and secrecy is still maintained. There also is a need for Algorithm-patents to be granted to such corporations such that competitors may not steal such algorithm with illicit practices within the IT-AI cell. Such endeavours are also likely to create jobs in Indian market, especially for the infamously unemployed engineers. Every coin has two sides to it. While we count the benefits of AI, as a downside, it has the potential to disrupt and jeopardise jobs of millions of people - not only in technology sector but also in finance and industries. In Law, AI might replace lawyers in research and can work multiple times faster using keyword searches and patterns. However, human supervision is required for final analysis of work.Global EffortsThe 70th session of the UN General Assembly focused on 'Rising to the Challenges of International Security and the Emergence of Artificial Intelligence', and in October 2017 led a joint meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the Second Committee to consider the role and impact of AI on sustainable development. The UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) launched its program on AI and Robotics in 2015 and declared to open a Centre on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in the Netherlands to monitor developments in AI and robotics, with the support of the Government of the Netherlands and the City of Hague. The agency will focus and closely monitor international activity, development and uses of AI[4]. Earlier, the European Union published a set of guidelines for companies and governments to develop ethical applications of artificial intelligence[5]. The brief seven requirements laid down are: (i) Human safety and oversight (ii) Technical robustness and safety (iii) Privacy and data governance (iv) Transparency (v) Diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness (vi) Environmental and societal well-being (vii) Accountability The focus of UN and EU on harmful impacts of AI raises concerns for the Indian Government as the AI wave hits the nation to see into and make new laws, or at least norms and regulations.ConclusionIf AI were not to be regulated, there lies a high chance, of misuse devastation caused by AI in wrong hands. The world is skating on thin ice with no regulation on such advanced technology capable of engaging autonomous weapons. AI engaged in illicit business practices gathers delicate information such as facial recognition, fingerprint and retina data, which people were hesitant to provide even to their own government are easily handing it to foreign private entities. Therefore, we need strong, clear and definitive laws for enjoying safer cyber-space and privacy because AI ...chine learning must be used effectively only for the welfare of the people. #Research inputs by Prince Malik, student researcher with Corp Comm Legal (law student with VIPS, Delhi).

The entire series of posts is available here[1].This post is authored by Kristian Stout[2], (Associate Director, International Center for Law &amp;#38; Economics]The public policy community's infatuation with digital privacy has grown by leaps and bounds since the enactment of GDPR[3] and the CCPA[4], but COVID-19 may leave the most enduring mark on the actual direction that privacy policy takes. As the pandemic and associated lockdowns first began, there were interesting discussions[5] cropping up[6] about the inevitable conflict between strong privacy fundamentalism and the pragmatic steps necessary to adequately trace the spread of infection.Axiomatic of this controversy is the Apple/Google contact tracing system[7], software developed for smartphones to assist with the identification of individuals and populations that have likely been in contact with the virus. The debate sparked by the Apple/Google proposal highlights what we miss when we treat 'privacy' (however defined) as an end in itself, an end that must necessarily trump other concerns. </p><p>The Apple/Google contact tracing efforts Apple/Google are doing yeoman's work attempting to produce a useful contact tracing API given the headwinds of privacy advocacy they face. Apple's webpage[8] describing its new contact tracing system is a testament to the extent to which strong privacy protections are central to its efforts. Indeed, those privacy protections are in the very name of the service: 'Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing' program. But, vitally, the utility of the Apple/Google API is ultimately a function of its efficacy as a tracing tool, not in how well it protects privacy.Apple/Google \u2014 despite the complaints of some states[9] \u2014are rolling out their Covid-19-tracking services with notable limitations. Most prominently, the APIs will not allow[10] collection of location data, and will only function when users explicitly opt-in[11]. This last point is important because there is evidence that opt-in requirements, by their nature, tend to reduce[12] the flow of information in a system, and when we are considering tracing solutions to an ongoing pandemic surely less information is not optimal. Further, all of the data collected through the API will be anonymized, preventing even healthcare authorities from identifying particular infected individuals.These restrictions prevent the tool from being as effective as it could be, but it's not clear how Apple/Google could do any better given the political climate. For years, the Big Tech firms have been villainized by privacy advocates that accuse them of spying on kids[13] and cavalierly disregarding consumer privacy[14] as they treat individuals' data as just another business input. The problem with this approach is that, in the midst of a generational crisis, our best tools are being excluded from the fight. Which begs the question: perhaps we have privacy all wrong? Privacy is one value among many The U.S. constitutional order explicitly protects our privacy as against state intrusion in order to guarantee, among other things, fair process and equal access to justice. But this strong presumption against state intrusion\u2014far from establishing a fundamental or absolute right to privacy\u2014only accounts for part of the privacy story.The Constitution's limit is a recognition of the fact that we humans are highly social creatures and that privacy is one value among many. Properly conceived, privacy protections are themselves valuable only insofar as they protect other things we value. Jane Bambauer explored some of this in an earlier post[15] where she characterized privacy as, at best, an 'instrumental right' \u2014that is a tool used to promote other desirable social goals such as 'fairness, safety, and autonomy.'Following from Jane's insight, privacy \u2014 as an instrumental good\u2014is something that can have both positive and negative externalities, and needs to be enlarged or attenuated as its ability to serve instrumental ends changes in different contexts.According to Jane:There is a moral imperative to ignore even express lack of consent when withholding important information that puts others in danger. Just as many states affirmatively require doctors, therapists, teachers, and other fiduciaries to report certain risks even at the expense of their client's and ward's privacy this same logic applies at scale to the collection and analysis of data during a pandemic.Indeed, dealing with externalities is one of the most common and powerful justifications for regulation, and an extreme form of 'privacy libertarianism' \u2014in the context of a pandemic\u2014 is likely to be, on net, harmful to society.Which brings us back to efforts of Apple/Google. Even if those firms wanted to risk the ire of privacy absolutists, it's not clear that they could do so without incurring tremendous regulatory risk, uncertainty and a popular backlash. As statutory matters, the CCPA[16] and the GDPR[17] chill experimentation in the face of potentially crippling fines. While the FTC Act's Section 5 prohibition on 'unfair or deceptive' practices is open to interpretation in manners which could result in existentially damaging outcomes. Further, some polling[18] suggests that the public appetite for contact tracing is not particularly high - though, as is often the case, such pro-privacy poll outcomes rarely give appropriate shrift to the tradeoff required.As a general matter, it's important to think about the value of individual privacy, and how best to optimally protect it. But privacy does not stand above all other values in all contexts. It is entirely reasonable to conclude that, in a time of emergency, if private firms can devise more effective solutions for mitigating the crisis, they should have more latitude to experiment. Knee-jerk preferences for an amorphous 'right of privacy' should not be used to block those experiments.Much as with the Cosmic Turtle, its tradeoffs all the way down. Most of the U.S. is in lockdown, and while we vigorously protect our privacy, we risk frustrating the creation of tools that could put a light at the end of the tunnel. We are, in effect, trading liberty and economic self-determination for privacy.Once the worst of the Covid-19 crisis has passed \u2014 hastened possibly by the use of contact tracing programs \u2014 we can debate the proper use of private data in exigent circumstances. For the immediate future, we should instead be encouraging firms like Apple/Google to experiment with better ways to control the pandemic. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20PrivacyThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20Privacyhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F07%2Fthe-negative-externalities-of-protecting-privacy%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Negative%20Externalities%20of%20Protecting%20PrivacyThe</url> post The Negative Externalities of Protecting Privacy[19] appeared first on Truth on the Market[20].

From politicians such as the Briton Jeremy Corbyn and the Americans Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders leading the charge, to celebrated academics inveighing against the sins of capitalism, to the hipster chic of the Jacobin crowd, a growing movement on the far left is trying to revive and rehabilitate a long-dormant ideological tradition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The movement's obsession is the pursuit of greater equality, expressed primarily through punitive leveling. Things that contribute to inequality, such as income or profit or wealth, are considered <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax.html\">public harms</url> that need to be controlled-by taxes, regulation, and other government policies. The consequences for other priorities, such as sustainable revenue, economic growth, technological innovation, and individual freedoms? Not part of the equation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Capitalism has strengths and weaknesses, and critiques of it are familiar-they've circulated widely ever since market-based economic systems started gaining ground in the eighteenth century. The force of those critiques, in fact, has helped fuel repeated reform movements over the ages, which have collectively transformed nineteenth-century laissez faire into the mixed welfare state economies of contemporary advanced industrial democracies.</p><p>Many on the left today are fighting for more of the same-continuing to pursue what used to be called \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-04-25/death-and-life-social-democracy\">social democracy</url>,\" using politics to control the private sector's excesses and harness its power for public benefit. That struggle is politically significant but theoretically uninteresting. The arguments for and against social democracy were worked out generations ago and still apply; take your pick.</p><p>The neosocialist movement is something different, however. Its roots lie not in social democracy but in democratic socialism, which seeks less to reform <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-06-13/capitalism-crisis\">capitalism</url> than to end it. And if its policies were ever put into practice, they would lead to disaster.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rousseau Would have Loved\u00a0a Wealth Tax</emphasis></p><p>Concerns about the unequal consequences of free markets have a long history. In the mid-eighteenth century, thinkers such as Voltaire and David Hume regarded the spread of commerce as a boon to humanity. In place of poverty, hierarchy, and religious conflict, they argued, markets promoted prosperity, intellectual dynamism, and social peace.</p><p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau countered that humans were obsessed with their social status, and since competition for status was a zero-sum game, they were generally miserable. The gains that markets brought were distributed unequally and so increased the differences among people, making them still unhappier. In a commercial society, he claimed, \"the privileged few gorge themselves with luxuries, while the starving multitude lack the bare necessities of life.\"</p><p>Adam Smith responded to Rousseau by arguing that under the right conditions, competitive markets could lead to \"universal opulence\"-by which he meant a respectable standard of living for everybody. That took care of the material problem, the starving multitudes lacking bare necessities. But it didn't get rid of the psychological problem, the anxiety about comparative social status.</p><p>The neosocialists are descended from Rousseau. They downplay poverty and fetishize <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-02-11/capitalism-and-inequality\">equality</url>, focus on wealth distribution rather than wealth creation, and seem to care as much about lowering those at the top as raising those at the bottom.</p><p>The movement's signature policy proposal is a wealth tax, an annual levy on household assets. Touted by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/starving-state\">economists</url> such as Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman, all associated with the Paris School of Economics, the concept has been embraced by both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, U.S. senators from Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively, who are running for the Democratic presidential nomination. At first,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all\">Warren</url> advocated a two percent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://Confirmed: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/upshot/warren-wealth-tax.html\">tax</url> on households worth more than $50 million and a three percent tax on billionaires. Later, pressed on how she would pay for her proposed universal health insurance, she doubled the billionaire tax to six percent. Sanders's plan starts at taxing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax.html\">$16 million</url> in assets at one percent and tops out at an eight percent tax for assets exceeding $10 billion.</p><p>The radicalism of this approach is often underestimated. Many people conflate wealth taxes with higher income taxes or see them as mere extensions of a similar concept. But wealth taxes are fundamentally different instruments with much broader ramifications for economic dynamism and individual liberty.</p><p>The main effect of a wealth tax would be to discourage wealthy individuals from holding demonstrable assets. Any individual or household within shouting distance of the threshold would have to get its assets valued annually, imposing costs and creating a permanent jobs program for tax lawyers and accountants, whose chief responsibility would be to figure out ways <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Saez-Zucman_conference-draft.pdf\">around the law</url>, including moving assets abroad.</p><p>A wealth tax would dramatically curtail <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jrose/2019/08/20/five-things-wealthy-people-invest-their-money-into/#3ab9f45b7017\">private investment</url>. The higher people rise on the economic ladder, the more of their resources go to investment instead of consumption. Those investments, in turn, often fuel innovative, risky ventures, which get funded in the hopes that they will eventually produce still greater gains. A wealth tax would upend the incentive structure for rich people, causing many to stop funding productive economic activity and focus instead on reducing their tax exposure and hiding their assets.</p><p>Warren contends that calculating one's wealth tax would be as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/elizabeth-warren-shares-a-calculator-for-billionaires-for-bill-gates-and-leon-cooperman.html\">easy</url> as calculating one's property tax, but that is ridiculous. Take a firm that has a market value but no income-a frequent situation for startups but also common for established firms in various situations, such as a turnaround. Rich investors in such firms would have to sell their shares to pay the wealth tax or force the companies to disburse cash rather than invest in the future. Either way, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/estimating-the-economic-impact-of-a-wealth-tax/\">tax</url> would discourage investment, reduce innovation, and encourage short-term thinking.</p><p>A wealth tax, finally, would force everyone whose assets were near its minimal threshold to give the government a full accounting of all those assets every year: homes, furniture, vehicles, heirlooms, bank accounts, investments and liabilities, and more. The result would be a huge expansion of the reach of government into citizens' lives, a corresponding reduction in citizens' privacy, and the accumulation and storage of vast amounts of highly sensitive data with few safeguards to prevent their misuse.</p><p>It is not only successful individuals who draw the neosocialists' ire; it is also successful companies. If a firm grows big enough to become famous, it becomes a potential target of vilification; if it grows too big, it becomes a target for destruction. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-06-24/ending-americas-endless-war\">Sanders</url>, Warren, and Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic representative from New York, accordingly, have all       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/bernie-sanders-facebook-google-amazon-1416786\">pledged</url> to break up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.</p><p>Here they can draw on a venerable antimonopoly tradition in American political culture from the trustbusters on, rooted in the assumption that the further away you move from Smith's ideal of perfect competition among many small firms, the more the public is hurt. The economist <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-12-12/schumpeters-heirs\">Joseph Schumpeter</url>, however, argued that Smith had greatly underestimated both the dynamism of capitalism and the role of entrepreneurs in driving it. Capitalism's manifold benefits didn't just happen; they were created, by a relatively small group of people responsible for introducing new products, services, and business methods.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-12-15/innovative-state\">Entrepreneurs</url> sought the big profits associated with temporary monopolies and so were driven to create whole new industries they could dominate.</p><p>Large companies, Schumpeter realized, acted as engines of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2014-12-15/start-slowdown\">innovation</url>, plowing back some of their profits into research and development and encouraging others to do the same in the hopes of becoming an acquisition target. He would have been delighted with Silicon Valley, viewing technology giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft as poster children for the enormous       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2014-12-15/power-market-creation\">benefits</url> to consumers that entrepreneurs generate.</p><p>Companies such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/interviews/2014-12-15/man-who-sells-everything\">Amazon</url> and Walmart, meanwhile, maintain their position through furious competition in service and price, contributing to the virtual elimination of inflation in the American economy. And yet it is precisely these dynamic, successful, customer-oriented companies that the neosocialists want to tax heavily, burden with regulations, and cut up for parts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE SKY IS NOT FALLING</emphasis></p><p>What is the cancer that requires such deadly radiation to cure? Supposedly, that median earnings per household in the United States have stagnated for several decades and, for the lower deciles of the income distribution, even declined. The implication is that most people's standard of living has flatlined or dropped over the last two generations. But this is just not true.</p><p>The first thing to note is that statistics about income brackets don't map neatly onto individual lives, because the people inside the income brackets keep changing. Those billionaires the neosocialists want to soak are not fourth-generation patrician trust-fund babies but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/your-money/where-the-billionaires-come-from.html\">self-made entrepreneurs</url>, and the lower brackets at any time include many young people and recent immigrants, who tend to move up later.</p><p>Second, the rich have indeed gotten much <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/inequality-wealth-rich-still-getting-richer/\">richer</url>-at a higher rate than those in the middle, and with those at the bottom improving the least-and inequality has certainly increased. But that does not mean the nonrich haven't improved their condition, too. As a recent study by the economist Bruce Sacerdote       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w23292.pdf\">concluded</url>, \"Meaningful growth in consumption for below median income families has occurred even in a prolonged period of increasing income inequality, increasing consumption inequality and a decreasing share of national income accruing to labor.\"</p><p>Beware the games that can be played with statistics. Households today, for example, are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/01/the-number-of-people-in-the-average-u-s-household-is-going-up-for-the-first-time-in-over-160-years/\">smaller</url> than they were a generation ago, with more people living alone or with a single parent. Even if household income is stagnant, therefore, per capita income may have risen. Then there is the changing age structure of society. As more people live longer, the share of the retired elderly is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/harvard_jchs_housing_growing_population_2016_chapter_4.pdf\">increasing</url>, and since they have less earnings, this has led to a decline in average household income. Income, moreover, should be understood to include not simply wages and salaries but also benefits. And employers have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://hrexecutive.com/are-employers-spending-more-now-on-employee-wellbeing/\">spent</url> ever more in recent decades on the costliest of benefits, health care-money that should be considered part of earnings. Add government transfer programs, which lower incomes at the top and raise incomes and expenditures at the bottom, and the picture changes again. It is not one of dystopian immiseration.</p><p>The intellectual heirs of Smith, as opposed to those of Rousseau, are interested less in capping inequality than in raising the standard of living of the population at large-finally achieving that \"universal opulence\" that Smith so presciently predicted free markets could deliver. Capitalism has proved so extraordinarily fertile and dynamic in finding ways to improve living standards, in fact, that it is difficult to track them.</p><p>Schumpeterian creative destruction has changed life in ways that are literally immeasurable. As the economist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2011-10-21/occupy-wall-street-and-washingtons-history-financial-bailouts\">Russell Roberts</url> has noted, even objects that are nominally the same, such as televisions, have evolved so much as to be incomparable over time. An average American television in 1973 showed half a dozen channels on a screen no larger than 25 inches wide. Today, the screens are larger and better, there are hundreds of channels available, and the unit is less a television than a digital hub. Personal computers used to be science fiction. Then they became ubiquitous. Now they seem to be ancient technology compared with the even more ubiquitous and powerful smartphones that bring the interconnected digital world to anybody, anywhere. Communication today is instantaneous and cheap; shopping is easier and better informed; everybody can watch or listen to what he or she wants, when he or she wants to; and nobody ever gets lost.</p><p>At one point in Monty Python's Life of Brian, a revolutionary in ancient Jerusalem asks his followers, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" His audience keeps shouting answers, until the speaker finally pleads, \"All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?\" (\"Brought peace!\" offers a final heckler.)</p><p>The neosocialists scorn billionaires and attack Big Tech, asking, \"What have Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and the rest ever done for us?\" Only made possible all the <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5383389/google-history-search-information/\">modern digital wonders</url> we increasingly take for granted. Have Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and the other entrepreneurs partially responsible for such blessings profited from their success? Absolutely. But so have the rest of us, and vastly more-in improved lives, to be sure, but even as a result of their companies' supposedly threatening corporate growth, since those companies are mostly owned by us, the broadly dispersed shareholders of their common stock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TURNING OFF THE ENGINE</emphasis></p><p>Capitalism drives economic and social dynamism, prosperity, and personal freedom but also erodes tradition and stability. It produces universal gains in the long term but inequality and volatility along the way. From Smith onward, the system's greatest defenders have acknowledged the full range of its effects and accepted the need to address the downsides in a variety of ways, not least in order to preserve political peace and social harmony. Capitalism's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2003-07-01/we-didnt-start-fire-capitalism-and-its-critics-then-and-now\">greatest critics</url>, in turn, have always respected its awesome capacity for growth and invention, and successful progressive movements have sought to domesticate markets rather than abolish them.</p><p>That is not the game the neosocialists are playing. What is distinctive about their program is not its promises-anybody can produce impossible wish lists-but its threats. They are fundamentally uninterested in sustaining a dynamic, entrepreneurial private sector and milking its proceeds for public investment. They don't care about the health of the geese, because their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-french-economist-who-helped-invent-elizabeth-warrens-wealth-tax\">economists</url> simply assume an endless supply of golden eggs. They abhor inequality and are out to reduce it in the simplest, most direct way possible: by lopping off the outliers at the top.</p><p>The growing popularity of this movement could not come at a worse time, for there are indeed crucial problems on today's agenda-climate change high among them. Dealing with these challenges will certainly require effective government policy and investment. But the bulk of the actual problem solving and practical innovation involved will inevitably come from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maikoschaffrath/2018/06/17/5-startups-that-prove-tech-can-solve-the-worlds-biggest-problems/#1ce248b812fd\">private sector</url>. The war against climate change, that is, will ultimately be fought and won in large part by an army of Schumpeterian entrepreneurs large and small, deploying their mage-like powers for humanity's collective defense. Unless the neosocialists have their way, and turn off the engines of innovation just when they are needed the most.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORAFR-1125279</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORAFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV6-F771-JCKT-T02C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7984</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Council on Foreign Relations, Inc.

Meanwhile, US competition regulators ordered Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook to hand over details on their takeovers of hundreds of smaller firms over the past decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Trade Commission wants to know if big tech has been buying up small tech in order to snuff out any competition before it poses a threat. There are almost certainly plenty of examples of exactly this happening, the question is whether it broke anti-trust law or not.</p><p>Also this week, the UK government said Ofcom would get new powers to crack down on social media companies that do not protect users from harmful content. The telecoms regulator will now be Britain's first de facto internet watchdog, a move that seems long overdue.</p><p>As does Google facing up to its breaches of the rules in Europe. The case now being heard in EU courts is the latest round of a decade-long battle with Europe's competition enforcers. It centres around how the tech giant prioritises results from its shopping comparison service ahead of those from other companies.</p><p>Google has similarly been found to have broken competition rules with its Android operating system and in the online ad market. For its part, Google says the EU's fine is \"wrong on the law, the facts and the economics\". We'll see.</p><p>Dozens of other court cases await Google and the other tech giants on a range of issues which are indicative of a wider clampdown on big tech. This is welcome but also serves to highlight how flat-footed lawmakers across the world have been to the enormous changes - both good and bad - that the online world ushered in.</p><p>In the time since dial-up modems started becoming commonplace in our homes, a generation has been born, educated, launched careers and started spawning the next generation. Yet still many of the battles about the shape of the online world are being fought with laws designed for an analogue age.</p><p>Since it was founded in 1998, Google has grown to be one of the world's biggest companies largely through brilliant products but in part by taking advantage of a set of rules that leaves plenty of room for exploitation. Currently, tech firms are legally allowed to hoover up untold amounts of users' personal data, shift billions of pounds in profits away in Bermuda, disseminate extreme material and profit from the spread of fake news - including political adverts containing outright lies.</p><p>There are steady steps towards fairer taxes on digital companies and tentative moves to bring in controls on online advertising, but the pace and intensity needs to step up several notches. There is broad support from voters across the political spectrum for greater controls on the dominant digital companies. But as the tech giants' problems multiply so do the teams of lobbyists and spin doctors employed to fight them.</p><p>Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg now heads up a legion of at least 700 people in Facebook's public affairs team. That is vast by any company's standards and represents a hefty chunk of Facebook's global workforce of 45,000. Last year, Facebook, Amazon and Apple all increased their spend on lobbying to influence Washington's notoriously money-driven political agenda. Google's outlay fell after a record lobbying bill in 2018.</p><p>Politicians and regulators in the US and beyond need to stand firm in the face of this wall of cash and implement the change that voters - not lobbyists - are calling for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000033348286-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-K1F1-JCS0-D51F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Second Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are almost certainly plenty of examples of exactly this happening, the question is whether it broke anti-trust law or not.</p><p>Also this week, the UK government said Ofcom would get new powers to crack down on social media companies that do not protect users from harmful content. The telecoms regulator will now be Britain's first de facto internet watchdog, a move that seems long overdue.</p><p>As does Google facing up to its breaches of the rules in Europe. The case now being heard in EU courts is the latest round of a decade-long battle with Europe's competition enforcers. It centres around how the tech giant prioritises results from its shopping comparison service ahead of those from other companies.</p><p>Google has similarly been found to have broken competition rules with its Android operating system and in the online ad market. For its part, Google says the EU's fine is \"wrong on the law, the facts and the economics\". We'll see.</p><p>Dozens of other court cases await Google and the other tech giants on a range of issues which are indicative of a wider clampdown on big tech. This is welcome but also serves to highlight how flat-footed lawmakers across the world have been to the enormous changes - both good and bad - that the online world ushered in.</p><p>In the time since dial-up modems started becoming commonplace in our homes, a generation has been born, educated, launched careers and started spawning the next generation. Yet still many of the battles about the shape of the online world are being fought with laws designed for an analogue age.</p><p>Since it was founded in 1998, Google has grown to be one of the world's biggest companies largely through brilliant products but in part by taking advantage of a set of rules that leaves plenty of room for exploitation. Currently, tech firms are legally allowed to hoover up untold amounts of users' personal data, shift billions of pounds in profits away in Bermuda, disseminate extreme material and profit from the spread of fake news - including political adverts containing outright lies.</p><p>There are steady steps towards fairer taxes on digital companies and tentative moves to bring in controls on online advertising, but the pace and intensity needs to step up several notches. There is broad support from voters across the political spectrum for greater controls on the dominant digital companies. But as the tech giants' problems multiply so do the teams of lobbyists and spin doctors employed to fight them.</p><p>Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg now heads up a legion of at least 700 people in Facebook's public affairs team. That is vast by any company's standards and represents a hefty chunk of Facebook's global workforce of 45,000. Last year, Facebook, Amazon and Apple all increased their spend on lobbying to influence Washington's notoriously money-driven political agenda. Google's outlay fell after a record lobbying bill in 2018.</p><p>Politicians and regulators in the US and beyond need to stand firm in the face of this wall of cash and implement the change that voters - not lobbyists - are calling for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000033348057-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-K1F1-JCS0-D501-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \"Obamacare for the Internet\" (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishing fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p> So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names -- Google, Facebook, Microsoft -- didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \"because they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\"</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for -- not against -- net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \"a grave threat to the Internet.\" Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Google and the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \"risked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\"</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn't be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> \"They wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\" Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Google is pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of Google Fiber said the impending FCC decision \"did not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\"</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position.

He explained that when former AAP CEO Tom Allen announced he planned to retire in early 2017, the board felt it was the right time to evaluate where the association stood and what changes needed to be made to keep pace with shifts in publishing and the economy in general.</p><p>The board settled on two longtime AAP themes-copyright protection and the protection of freedom of expression-but added a new, more aggressive public policy position, through which the AAP plans to advocate about the value of publishing to the culture and to the economy, as well as to more actively support laws and regulations that, according to the AAP's mission statement, \"incentivize the publication of creative expression, professional content, and learning solutions.\"</p><p>To achieve its new goals, the AAP has been \"refined,\" Dohle said-a process that involved, among other actions, closing its New York City and Philadelphia offices and centering its organization in Washington, D.C. He added that the board has been \"energized\" by the early results of the new approach.</p><p>That approach has been led by Maria Pallante, who was named CEO in January 2017. The shift in focus mandated by the board and executed by Pallante was reflected in the creation of a new AAP award. At this year's meeting, the Award for Distinguished Publish Service was given to Doug Collins, a congressman from Georgia and cochair of the Creative Rights Caucus, which was formed to protect the rights of content creators. In presenting the award, Pallante cited Collins's efforts sponsoring policies that respect \"the value of original works\" and that distinguish him as someone working \"to improve the copyright system.\"</p><p>The AAP's focus on competing with tech giants was seen in the presentation by Benjamin Marks of Weil Gothsal &amp; Manges, which was titled, \"Competition and Consumer Protection: What Regulators Are Asking About Big Tech and What It Means for Publishing.\" He spoke against the backdrop of government hearings being conducted to review antitrust laws and other consumer protection regulations. Marks noted that, under current antitrust laws, regulators are mostly concerned with \"protecting competition, not competitors,\" adding that they see nothing wrong with a new company offering products at lower prices, which has the effect of knocking out competitors. But with the new populist sentiment, he said, regulators are considering looking beyond pricing to examine such issues as whether the existence of some mammoth tech companies reduces consumer choice.</p><p>Marks said that it is reasonable to investigate whether certain technology platforms skew consumer choices, adding that it is \"only natural\" to ask whether Amazon favors the products of its publishing division and movie studio over those of competitors. He noted that the current hearings are a \"golden opportunity\" for publishers to bring what they see as anticompetitive behavior to the attention of regulators. He also said that the hearings present a chance for publishers to show that, in an era of widespread misinformation, they play an important role in the delivery of credible information.</p><p>AAP's ongoing commitment to free speech was reflected in the presentation of its 16th International Freedom to Publish/Jeri Laber Award. Freedom to Publish chair Geoff Shandler said the need for the award persists as publishers are threatened in numerous parts of the world. This year's award went to Azadeh Parsapour, the publisher of Nogaam Publishing. A native of Iran, Parsapour operates her digital publishing company from London, where she produces a range of books for readers back home that likely would be banned or censored there. Parsapour delivered her acceptance speech in a recorded video, since, being an Iranian citizen, she was prevented by Homeland Security from entering the U.S.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBWKY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBWKY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TB3-89X1-DXMV-W0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404869</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 PWxyz, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Publisher's Weekly</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5977\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 265</volume><issueNumber>No. 39</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Copyright Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzM3NEE0Qjk0NzRCNDhFM0E0NjM2RTE4M0QzNTczMTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFEMTZEM0VBQjU4NDY1MUFGMkRDM0RDRjFBNkUyNEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhERDkzMkQ3QzgwNENFNEJDOTBEQjI5OTlDMjc5MDE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

In the interim, San Francisco Bay area housing developer Alastair Mactaggart launchedCalifornians for Consumer Privacy and qualified the CaCPA for the November 2018 ballot. As drafted, CaCPA had a provision that would only permit amendment if approved by 70 percent of each house of the legislature (and only if the amendments were ' consistent with and further the intent of' the CaCPA). The legislature reached an agreement with Mactaggart to pass a version of the CaCPA so long as he withdrew the initiative and in a period of seven days the CaCPA went from inactive to being signed by the Governor on June 28th. As Santa Clara Law School Professor Eric Goldman noted1  The result is asweeping, lengthy (10,000 words!), insanely complicated, and poorly drafted privacy regulationthat will govern the world's fifth largest economy. Needless to say, this rushed and non-inclusiveprocess created a law with many defects, ranging from typos and drafting errors to terrible policyideas.(2) CaCPA Enumerated RightsCaCPA explains that California law 'has not kept pace' with the privacy implications surrounding the increased collection, use and protection of consumer information. 'California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and they want to be certain that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information.' As a result, the legislation states that it is seeking to further Californians' Constitutional right to privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control their personal information, by ensuring the following rights: (1)The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them. (2)The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom. (3)The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information. (4)The right of Californians to access their personal information. (5)The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.(3) What is 'Personal Information'CaCPA's obligations extend to 'personal information' of a California resident, which it defines broadly to include 'any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.' The Act provides a list of examples of data sources that are personal information including personally identifiable information, IP address, browsing information, biometric and geolocation data etc., but the definition also includes inferencesdrawn from these sources.(4) Who Does It Apply To?The requirements of the CaCPA extend to a business that(a) collects, transfers or sell personal information of a California consumer and (b) either: Has annual gross revenue in excess of $25 million; or Purchases, receives, sells or shares the personal information of 50,000 or more 'consumer, households or devices'; or Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information. An IAPP analysis found that the first prong alone would apply to over 500,000 businesses.2 One commentator raised concerns about the second prong of the test, fearing that the 50,000 'consumer, households or devices'threshold may ensnare most online retailers and even bloggers just by the passive collection of IP addresses.3(5) Privacy Policy DisclosuresPrior to collecting Californian's personal data, businesses must disclose in their privacy policy: 'the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used' (with any additional uses requiring notice to the consumer); lists of the of the categories of personal information it has collected, sold or disclosed; and a description of the consumer's rights under the Act including its right to opt-out, to request data deletion and how to request information on the data the business collected, disclosed or sold. Businesses also must provide a clear link on their homepage titled, 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information,' to a page that enables consumers to opt-out out of the sale of its personal information. See IAPP,CaCPA: What To Disclose and Where To Disclose It[2]. (6) Disclosure Requests and Opting Out Businesses must make 'two or more' methods for consumers, including a toll-free number and website, for consumers to exercise the disclosure rights under the Act. This includes requesting that a business that collects, transfers or sells their data to disclose to that consumer free of charge within forty-five days of a 'verified' request:the categories of personal information it has collected about that consumer; the sources from which the personal information is collected; the purpose for collecting or selling personal information; the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information; and the specific pieces of personal information it has collected about that consumer.The consumer information provided must be in a 'readily useable format' (i.e., data portability). The consumer may request that a business delete any personal information or opt-out of the further sale or transfer of such data (subject to exceptions such as if the data is needed to perform the service for the consumer). (7) Non-Discrimination CaCPA provides that businesses 'shall not discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of the consumer's rights under this title' by denying service or offering different services or prices based on the exercise of rights under the Act - except where it is 'reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer's data.' How this is interpreted remains to be seen. Businesses, however, may offer financial incentives to consumers for the use of their data on an opt-in basis.(8) Consent for MinorsWhile CaCPA generally establishes an opt-out regime, that is not the case for consumers under the age of 16. Businesses may not sell the personal information of consumers under 17 years without the affirmative consent of the consumer if aged 13-16 or a parent or guardian if under 13.(9) PenaltiesEnforcement of the statute is generally by the California Attorney General who may recover up to $7,500 per intentional violation and $2,500 for an unintentional violation that is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice. CaCPA provides for a limited private right of action to a consumer 'whosenonencrypted or nonredacted personal information. . . is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business' violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information.' An injured consumer may recover $750 per incident but must give prior notice and an opportunity to cure to the business before filing suit. The consumer also must notify the California Attorney General within thirty days of filing suit, who may take over the action or order the consumer not to proceed with the action.(10) CaCPA As a Moving TargetCaCPA goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and directs the California Attorney General to implement regulations on or before the effective date on a variety of items - including procedures for processing consumer requests. At the same time, CaCPA backers fully expect to enact clarifying amendments to the law either later this year4 or in 2019 - and industry is pushing to narrow the scope of the bill.5 As a result, businesses are being asked to comply with what is, in essence, a moving target. Passage of CaCPA also has stirred debate in other state capitals and in Washington. Big Tech has been meeting with the Trump administration[3] over a potential federal privacy bill that would likely preempt the California law; while former Obama administrations have suggested revisiting their proposed 'Privacy Bill of Rights[4]'.6 In 2003, Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act less than 90-days after California attempted to ban spam and prior to the bill going into effect. Privacy, however, is a much more complex subject that would involve the jurisdiction of multiple committees in both houses making a quick consensus more difficult to achieve. In a three-part series for the IAPP[5], Robert Gellman outlines the challenges of passing a U.S. privacy law and concludes: It is apparent that there are many obstacles: substantive, procedural, and political. If everyone worked in good faith, it's conceivable that something acceptable could emerge in a few years. However, I don't think that there is enough consensus in the U.S. privacy world to have much hope right now. Maybe the dynamic will change as the EU moves to enforce the GDPR. Maybe not.(11) What Should You Do?Whether it is the EU's GDPR or CCPA, businesses need to be ready for a potential new era of privacy scrutiny and should: begin to map and inventory the data they collect and how it is used and shared (this includes assessing the need for such data consistent with GDPR data minimization); determine operationally what steps they would need to take to respond to information requests under CaCPA; and consider creating separate websites for California users(12) ResourcesSee notes below; Professor Solove's California Consumer Privacy Act resources page[6];Lydia de la Torre's comparison of GDPR and CACPA[7];and theAssembly Committee On Privacy And Consumer Protection's analysis of the CaCPA (immediately below)//      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/386612047/content?start_page=1...w;_mode=...ess;_key=key-jcspfhSeSMI7R7GPPN4A\">www.scribd.com/embeds/386612047/content?start_page=1...w;_mode=...ess;_key=key-jcspfhSeSMI7R7GPPN4A</url>[8] View this document on Scribd[9]NOTES1 Goldman, Eric, An Introduction to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[10] (July 9, 2018). 2 Rita Heimes ...m Pfeifle, New California Privacy Law to Affect More Than Half A Million US Companies[11],IAPP (July 2, 2018). 3Lothar Determann,Analysis: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018[12],IAPP (July 2, 2018). Most companies operate websites and inevitably capture IP addresses. Notably, companies need to comply regardless of whether the website targeted businesses or individual customers in California given that the term 'consumer' is defined to mean any 'resident.' Even individual bloggers and relatively small businesses outside California may find it difficult to ensure that they do not receive personal information of more than 50,000 California resident visitors to their website annually, simply from having it be passively accessible from there, and, within California, most retailers, fitness studios, music venues and other businesses will meet this threshold. 4 SeeSB-1121[13] currently pending. 5 Wendy Davis, California Lawmakers Urged To Reject Attempts To Weaken Privacy Law[14], Digital News Daily (Aug. 13, 2018). 6 Tony Romm,The Trump administration is talking to Facebook and Google about potential rules for online privacy[15], Washington Post (July 27, 2018); Cameron F.

As the companies' youthful bosses arrive each morning at their eco-friendly offices in their T-shirts and sneakers, they like to imagine they are a cut above conventional business leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's mission statement is ``Don't be evil'' and its founders, Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, say they want to make the world a better place. Facebook's freshly minted billionaire boss, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>28, claims he is dedicated to ``openness, connecting and sharing''.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before his death last year Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said: ``Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter. Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.''</p><p>The shine is coming off Silicon Valley's finest, however. Last week Britain's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, announced it was reopening its investigation into Google's Street View cars, which travel around taking photographs to create the search engine's popular mapping service.</p><p>It has emerged that Googleprogrammed the vehicles to gather private data, including email, web searches and photographs, from unsecured home WiFi networks. It also stands accused of trying to cover up what it had been doing. Even before such targeted data collection, Googleprovoked complaints in Australia and other countries when it filmed streets for its Street View service.</p><p>European Union regulators are examining claims that Googleis abusing its dominance in the search business by ranking its own products higher up in results than those of its rivals. A similar case in the 1990s tarnished the reputation and hit the profits of Microsoft, then the world's most fearsome tech behemoth.</p><p>The latest moves come as Apple faces criticism over its plans, revealed last week, for an answer to Street View: an even more intrusive 3D service using military-grade aerial camera satellites (drones) capable of revealing objects as small as 10cm across.</p><p>Facebookis having a torrid time, too. Shares in the world's most successful social network have fallen sharply since it floated on the Nasdaq in New York last month. To add to its woes, figures released last week showed its hitherto phenomenal growth is beginning to slow. In April, its site had 158 million unique users, up only 5 per cent on a year earlier, according to the research firm comScore -- the lowest rise since it began tracking the data in 2008.</p><p>The new figures have fuelled the anger of many disgruntled small investors who are suing Facebookover claims that it had told bankers and a select group of investors that its growth was slowing before its float -- but neglected to share the information with them.</p><p>The recent setbacks mean the bosses of the big tech firms will spend a lot less time talking to their sneaker-wearing staff this northern summer and a lot more time talking to buttoned-up lawyers. Googlefaces fines if the ICO finds its Street View cars breached data protection laws. The company could also face a police investigation in Britain.</p><p>How did we fall out of love with these pillars of the new economy whose services and products have so quickly become central to our lives? The simple answer is that consumers and legislators alike have finally woken up to an uncomfortable truth: despite their laid-back image, these tech giants are just as corporate, money-grabbing and venal as the old-school businesses they so disdain.</p><p>As Rob Cox, a leading US technology writer, puts it: ``Under the hoodies and the moral language lurk rapacious business people, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.''</p><p>The charge sheet against the big tech firms is long: as well as pinching the private data of unsuspecting home owners, carrying out creepy aerial surveillance and ripping off investors, they also stand accused of violating privacy.</p><p>Each makes money by vacuuming up the digital footprint we leave online and using it to sell advertisements or market products. Hardly a day passes without some new revelation of one of them taking a byte too far.</p><p>Googlerecently altered its computer code to circumvent the privacy settings in Apple's Safari web browser, used by hundreds of millions of people. Facebookhas come under fire for allowing companies to turn users' ``likes'' into advertisements that are then sent to their own online friends.</p><p>Googleis accused of ``looking the other way'' on copyright. Newspapers and magazines say the search engine ``steals'' their content and uses it to sell lucrative advertisements. Like Google, Apple is under investigation for monopolistic practices. The US justice department is examining claims that the company, along with several publishers, colluded to raise the price of electronic books.</p><p>Apple has also been condemned for using Chinese manufacturers with lousy working practices. Foxconn, the Chinese factory where Apple's iPhones are made, has been investigated for treating its workers so badly that some have committed suicide.</p><p>Worst of all, say critics, is the aggressive tax avoidance practised by the big three. Google, Facebookand Apple have each set up elaborate webs of companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies through tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The complex arrangements allow them -- legally -- to slash their tax bills.</p><p>For example, in Britain in 2010 Googlepaid just pound stg. 1.2 million ($1.8m) in corporation tax on sales that topped pound stg. 2.2 billion. Meanwhile, Apple has stashed two-thirds of its $US110 billion ($109bn) cash hoard overseas, out of the reach of the US taxman. In Australia, Google, Facebookand Apple's iTunes store recognise much of their Australian revenue in other countries with more favourable tax environments.</p><p>GoogleAustralia is reported to have paid income tax of $74,176 in Australia last year while building its advertising sales to almost $1bn. Most of its sales here are recognised by the global giant's subsidiary in Ireland.</p><p>At every step of the way the companies have resisted attempts to clip their wings and even allegedly frustrated investigations into their less savoury practices. In April, the US Federal Communications Commission said Googlehad ``deliberately impeded and delayed'' its inquiry into the Street View data collection.</p><p>The tech giants have fought bitterly against any restrictions on internet use, opposing government attempts to introduce filters to prevent children accessing pornographic or violent images and moves to limit cyber bullying. Such ``catch-all'' filters do not work, they insist. Critics retort that the companies will not introduce filters because they would limit search results, reducing the adverts that could be sold. Search engine-driven advertising is a $US10bn market.</p><p>Put the charges together and some observers say tech firms are taking over from banks as the corporate villains of our times. ``Technology is replacing banking and finance as the industry most likely to worry government and the public,'' Time magazine said recently.</p><p>Googlehas apologised for harvesting data. ``We screwed up,'' said Eric Schmidt, its executive chairman. The company denies that it engages in anti-competitive behaviour and insists it offers safe web searching to protect children. Facebookrejects claims that it misled investors when it floated and says it is beefing up its privacy controls. Apple denies monopolistic practices, while Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, has visited Foxconn and ordered fresh checks on factory working conditions.</p><p>Understandably, the three also emphasise the positives: they have created the greatest explosion</p><p>of democracy, access to information and ability to connect and communicate that the world has seen -- all of which has generated great wealth.</p><p>This is undoubtedly true, yet there is a nagging doubt that, like the big banks in the US before the financial crash, these titans of the new economy are woefully lightly regulated.</p><p>If an airline does something as simple and annoying as lose our luggage, we get compensation. If a web operator pinches our data and then tries to cover its tracks, we get nothing, even though data theft can lead to identity theft.</p><p>``The web is largely unregulated,'' says Peter Sommer, a London-based cyber expert.</p><p>Some people are trying to fight back. Authorities in Britain, the US and Australia are looking at how to close loopholes to force the tech giants to pay more tax. Politicians are drawing up an online privacy ``bill of rights''. To protect copyright, two anti-piracy bills have been proposed in the US.</p><p>Yet there is little evidence that such moves are working. Heavy lobbying by Silicon Valley, whose economic might makes it of vital importance to the US economy, has seen off proposed legislation. While some users might make use of new privacy codes, most of us are so wedded to our iPads, smartphones and Facebookthat we cannot imagine life without them and will not give them up -- regardless of how the companies that own them behave. This article was prepared using Google's search engine and its suite of online word-processing products.</p><p>Ironically, big tech's critics might find a solution in tech itself. Alarmed by the backlash against them, Google, Microsoft and Apple have indicated they might support the development of a ``do not track'' button in all web browsers. By flipping a switch, users could instruct websites not to monitor their online behaviour.</p><p>Independent tech firms are starting to offer consumers the chance to protect their data. Safetyweb helps parents monitor their children's activities on social networking sites and is launching myID.com, a privacy protection service for adults. Other firms offer consumers the chance to profit from their personal information: the London-based Allow Ltd gathers consumers' data and lets them sell it to companies they approve of -- in return for a small fee.</p><p>Then there is the ultimate technological solution: switch off. Googleand Facebookknow that if they lose the trust of their users they are only a few clicks away from extinction, such as AltaVista or Netscape. Apple has had more than enough brushes with corporate mortality to know its future is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the end it is you and me, the users, who have the real power over the big three. If we continue to log on, they will carry on growing -- and doing whatever they like.</p><p>If we turn against them or switch to a new operator whose products and values we prefer, they will die in a heartbeat. The choice is ours -- at the click of a mouse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS201206181011301221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55X1-NGC1-F0JP-W2FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>1 - All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 18, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Big tech companies like Google and Facebook use AI to obtain insights on their gargantuan trove of detailed customer data. This allows them monetize users' collective preferences through practices such as micro-targeting, a strategy used by advertisers to narrowly target specific sets of users. In parallel, many people now trust platforms and algorithms more than their own governments and civic society. </p><p>An October 2018 study suggested that people demonstrate ' algorithm appreciation ,' to the extent that they would rely on advice more when they think it is from an algorithm than from a human. In the past, technology experts have worried about a 'digital divide' between those who could access computers and the internet and those who could not. Households with less access to digital technologies are at a disadvantage in their ability to earn money and accumulate skills . But, as digital devices proliferate, the divide is no longer just about access. How do people deal with information overload and the plethora of algorithmic decisions that permeate every aspect of their lives? The savvier users are navigating away from devices and becoming aware about how algorithms affect their lives. Meanwhile, consumers who have less information are relying even more on algorithms to guide their decisions. Should you stay connected - or unplug? pryzmat/shutterstock.com The secret sauce behind artificial intelligence The main reason for the new digital divide, in my opinion as someone who studies information systems, is that so few people understand how algorithms work . For a majority of users, algorithms are seen as a black box. AI algorithms take in data, fit them to a mathematical model and put out a prediction, ranging from what songs you might enjoy to how many years someone should spend in jail . These models are developed and tweaked based on past data and the success of previous models. Most people - even sometimes the algorithm designers themselves - do not really know what goes inside the model. Researchers have long been concerned about algorithmic fairness. For instance, Amazon's AI-based recruiting tool turned out to dismiss female candidates . Amazon's system was selectively extracting implicitly gendered words - words that men are more likely to use in everyday speech, such as 'executed' and 'captured.' Other studies have shown that judicial algorithms are racially biased, sentencing poor black defendants for longer than others. As part of the recently approved General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, people have 'a right to explanation' of the criteria that algorithms use in their decisions. This legislation treats the process of algorithmic decision-making like a recipe book. The thinking goes that if you understand the recipe, you can understand how the algorithm affects your life. Meanwhile, some AI researchers have pushed for algorithms that are fair, accountable and transparent , as well as interpretable , meaning that they should arrive at their decisions through processes that humans can understand and trust. What effect will transparency have? In one study , students were graded by an algorithm and offered different levels of explanation about how their peers' scores were adjusted to to get to a final grade. The students with more transparent explanations actually trusted the algorithm less. This, again, suggests a digital divide: Algorithmic awareness does not lead to more confidence in the system. But transparency is not a panacea. Even when an algorithm's overall process is sketched out, the details may still be too complex for users to comprehend. Transparency will help only users who are sophisticated enough to grasp the intricacies of algorithms. For example, in 2014, Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, was initially denied a mortgage refinance by an automated system . Most individuals who are applying for such a mortgage refinance would not understand how algorithms might determine their creditworthiness. What does the algorithm say to do today? Maria Savenko/shutterstock.com Opting out of the new information ecosystem While algorithms influence so much of people's lives, only a tiny fraction of participants are sophisticated enough to fully engage in how algorithms affect their life . There are not many statistics about the number of people who are algorithm aware. Studies have found evidence of algorithmic anxiety , leading to a deep imbalance of power between platforms that deploy algorithms and the users who depend on them . A study of Facebook usage found that when participants were made aware of Facebook's algorithm for curating news feeds, about 83% of participants modified their behavior to try to take advantage of the algorithm, while around 10% decreased their usage of Facebook. A November 2018 report from the Pew Research Center found that a broad majority of the public had significant concerns about the use of algorithms for particular uses. It found that 66% thought it would not be fair for algorithms to calculate personal finance scores, while 57% said the same about automated resume screening. A small fraction of individuals exercise some control over how algorithms use their personal data. For example, the Hu-Manity platform allows users an option to control how much of their data is collected . Online encyclopedia Everipedia offers users the ability to be a stakeholder in the process of curation, which means that users can also control how information is aggregated and presented to them. However, a vast majority of platforms do not provide either such flexibility to their end users or the right to choose how the algorithm uses their preferences in curating their news feed or in recommending them content. If there are options, users may not know about them. About 74% of Facebook's users said in a survey that they were not aware of how the platform characterizes their personal interests . In my view, the new digital literacy is not using a computer or being on the internet, but understanding and evaluating the consequences of an always-plugged-in lifestyle. This lifestyle has a meaningful impact on how people interact with others ; on their ability to pay attention to new information ; and on the complexity of their decision-making processes . Increasing algorithmic anxiety may also be mirrored by parallel shifts in the economy. A small group of individuals are capturing the gains from automation , while many workers are in a precarious position . Opting out from algorithmic curation is a luxury - and could one day be a symbol of affluence available to only a select few. The question is then what the measurable harms will be for those on the wrong side of the digital divide.

This allows them monetize users' collective preferences through practices such as micro-targeting, a strategy used by advertisers to narrowly target specific sets of users. </p><p>In parallel, many people now trust platforms and algorithms more than their own governments and civic society. An October 2018 study suggested that people demonstrate \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/10/do-people-trust-algorithms-more-than-companies-realize\">algorithm appreciation</url>,\" to the extent that they would rely on advice more when they think it is from an algorithm than from a human.</p><p>In the past, technology experts have worried about a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/digital-divide/\">\"digital divide\"</url> between those who could access computers and the internet and those who could not. Households with less access to digital technologies are at a disadvantage in their ability to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/digital-divide\">earn money and accumulate skills</url>. </p><p>But, as digital devices proliferate, the divide is no longer just about access. How do people deal with information overload and the plethora of algorithmic decisions that permeate every aspect of their lives? </p><p>The savvier users are navigating away from devices and becoming aware about how algorithms affect their lives. Meanwhile, consumers who have less information are relying even more on algorithms to guide their decisions. </p><h>The secret sauce behind artificial intelligence</h><p>The main reason for the new digital divide, in my opinion as someone who studies information systems, is that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/2017_usacm_statement_algorithms.pdf\">so few people understand how algorithms work</url>. For a majority of users, algorithms are seen as a black box. </p><p>AI algorithms take in data, fit them to a mathematical model and put out a prediction, ranging from <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/\">what songs you might enjoy</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/Angele%20Christin.pdf\">how many years someone should spend in jail</url>. These models are developed and tweaked based on past data and the success of previous models. Most people - even sometimes the algorithm designers themselves - do not really know what goes inside the model.</p><p>Researchers <url normalizedValue=\"https://epic.org/algorithmic-transparency/\">have long been concerned</url> about algorithmic fairness. For instance, Amazon's AI-based recruiting tool turned out to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G\">dismiss female candidates</url>. Amazon's system was selectively extracting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G\">implicitly gendered words</url> - words that men are more likely to use in everyday speech, such as \"executed\" and \"captured.\" </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx032\">Other studies</url> have shown that judicial algorithms are racially biased, sentencing poor black defendants for longer than others.</p><p>As part of the recently approved General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, people have <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/idpl/ipx022\">\"a right to explanation\"</url> of the criteria that algorithms use in their decisions. This legislation treats the process of algorithmic decision-making like a recipe book. The thinking goes that if you understand the recipe, you can understand how the algorithm affects your life. </p><p>Meanwhile, some AI researchers have pushed for algorithms that are <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fatml.org\">fair, accountable and transparent</url>, as well as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490\">interpretable</url>, meaning that they should arrive at their decisions through processes that humans can understand and trust. </p><p>What effect will transparency have? In <url normalizedValue=\"http://rene.kizilcec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kizilcec2016information.pdf\">one study</url>, students were graded by an algorithm and offered different levels of explanation about how their peers' scores were adjusted to to get to a final grade. The students with more transparent explanations actually trusted the algorithm less. This, again, suggests a digital divide: Algorithmic awareness does not lead to more confidence in the system.</p><p>But transparency is not a panacea. Even when an algorithm's overall process is sketched out, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2018/07/we-need-transparency-in-algorithms-but-too-much-can-backfire\">the details may still be too complex</url> for users to comprehend. Transparency will help only users who are sophisticated enough to grasp the intricacies of algorithms. </p><p>For example, in 2014, Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, was initially <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdt.org/issue/privacy-data/digital-decisions/\">denied a mortgage refinance by an automated system</url>. Most individuals who are applying for such a mortgage refinance would not understand how algorithms might determine their creditworthiness. </p><h>Opting out of the new information ecosystem</h><p>While algorithms influence so much of people's lives, only a tiny fraction of participants are sophisticated enough to fully engage in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/02/08/code-dependent-pros-and-cons-of-the-algorithm-age/\">how algorithms affect their life</url>. </p><p>There are not many statistics about the number of people who are algorithm aware.  Studies have found evidence of <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2686227\">algorithmic anxiety</url>, leading to a deep imbalance of power between platforms that deploy algorithms and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-taking-economy-uber-information-and-power/\">the users who depend on them</url>. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.kevinhamilton.org/share/papers/p153-eslami.pdf\">A study of Facebook usage</url> found that when participants were made aware of Facebook's algorithm for curating news feeds, about 83% of participants modified their behavior to try to take advantage of the algorithm, while around 10% decreased their usage of Facebook.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/11/16/attitudes-toward-algorithmic-decision-making/\">A November 2018 report from the Pew Research Center</url> found that a broad majority of the public had significant concerns about the use of algorithms for particular uses. It found that 66% thought it would not be fair for algorithms to calculate personal finance scores, while 57% said the same about automated resume screening. </p><p>A small fraction of individuals exercise some control over how algorithms use their personal data. For example, the Hu-Manity platform allows users <url normalizedValue=\"https://hu-manity.co\">an option to control how much of their data is collected</url>. Online encyclopedia       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://everipedia.org\">Everipedia</url> offers users the ability to be a stakeholder in the process of curation, which means that users can also control how information is aggregated and presented to them. </p><p>However, a vast majority of platforms do not provide either such flexibility to their end users or the right to choose how the algorithm uses their preferences in curating their news feed or in recommending them content. If there are options, users may not know about them. About 74% of Facebook's users said in a survey that they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2019/01/16/facebook-algorithms-and-personal-data/\">not aware of how the platform characterizes their personal interests</url>. </p><p>In my view, the new digital literacy is not using a computer or being on the internet, but understanding and evaluating the consequences of an always-plugged-in lifestyle. </p><p>This lifestyle has a meaningful impact on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/sunday-review/human-contact-luxury-screens.html\">how people interact with others</url>; on their ability to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://compeap.com/a-wealth-of-information-creates-a-poverty-of-attention/\">pay attention to new information</url>; and on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90315430/why-forgetting-at-work-sometimes-helps-you-make-better-decisions\">the complexity of their decision-making processes</url>.</p><p>Increasing algorithmic anxiety may also be mirrored by parallel shifts in the economy. A small group of individuals are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/economy/productivity-inequality-wages.html\">capturing the gains from automation</url>, while many workers are in a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/03/25/automation-perpetuates-the-red-blue-divide/\">precarious position</url>.</p><p>Opting out from algorithmic curation is a luxury - and could one day be a symbol of affluence available to only a select few. The question is then what the measurable harms will be for those on the wrong side of the digital divide. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anjana Susarla does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUSA-114719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUSA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX4-4G81-JB75-92JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1177\"/><timeReceived>10:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United States</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6137\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001089</classCode><className>MATHEMATICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp;

Big tech companies like Google and Facebook use AI to obtain insights on their gargantuan trove of detailed customer data. This allows them monetize users' collective preferences through practices such as micro-targeting, a strategy used by advertisers to narrowly target specific sets of users. </p><p>In parallel, many people now trust platforms and algorithms more than their own governments and civic society. An October 2018 study suggested that people demonstrate 'algorithm appreciation[4],' to the extent that they would rely on advice more when they think it is from an algorithm than from a human. In the past, technology experts have worried about a 'digital divide'[5] between those who could access computers and the internet and those who could not. Households with less access to digital technologies are at a disadvantage in their ability to earn money and accumulate skills[6]. But, as digital devices proliferate, the divide is no longer just about access. How do people deal with information overload and the plethora of algorithmic decisions that permeate every aspect of their lives? The savvier users are navigating away from devices and becoming aware about how algorithms affect their lives. Meanwhile, consumers who have less information are relying even more on algorithms to guide their decisions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/268397/original/file-20190409-2931-32k090.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/268397/original/file-20190409-2931-32k090.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   Should you stay connected - or unplug? pryzmat/shutterstock.com[7]  The secret sauce behind artificial intelligence The main reason for the new digital divide, in my opinion as someone who studies information systems, is that so few people understand how algorithms work[8]. For a majority of users, algorithms are seen as a black box. AI algorithms take in data, fit them to a mathematical model and put out a prediction, ranging from what songs you might enjoy[9] to how many years someone should spend in jail[10]. These models are developed and tweaked based on past data and the success of previous models. Most people - even sometimes the algorithm designers themselves - do not really know what goes inside the model. Researchers have long been concerned[11] about algorithmic fairness. For instance, Amazon's AI-based recruiting tool turned out to dismiss female candidates[12]. Amazon's system was selectively extracting implicitly gendered words[13] - words that men are more likely to use in everyday speech, such as 'executed' and 'captured.' Other studies[14] have shown that judicial algorithms are racially biased, sentencing poor black defendants for longer than others. As part of the recently approved General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, people have 'a right to explanation'[15] of the criteria that algorithms use in their decisions. This legislation treats the process of algorithmic decision-making like a recipe book. The thinking goes that if you understand the recipe, you can understand how the algorithm affects your life. Meanwhile, some AI researchers have pushed for algorithms that are fair, accountable and transparent[16], as well as interpretable[17], meaning that they should arrive at their decisions through processes that humans can understand and trust. What effect will transparency have? In one study[18], students were graded by an algorithm and offered different levels of explanation about how their peers' scores were adjusted to to get to a final grade. The students with more transparent explanations actually trusted the algorithm less. This, again, suggests a digital divide: Algorithmic awareness does not lead to more confidence in the system. But transparency is not a panacea. Even when an algorithm's overall process is sketched out, the details may still be too complex[19] for users to comprehend. Transparency will help only users who are sophisticated enough to grasp the intricacies of algorithms. For example, in 2014, Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, was initially denied a mortgage refinance by an automated system[20]. Most individuals who are applying for such a mortgage refinance would not understand how algorithms might determine their creditworthiness.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/267399/original/file-20190403-177175-u8457s.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/267399/original/file-20190403-177175-u8457s.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   What does the algorithm say to do today? Maria Savenko/shutterstock.com[21]  Opting out of the new information ecosystem While algorithms influence so much of people's lives, only a tiny fraction of participants are sophisticated enough to fully engage in how algorithms affect their life[22]. There are not many statistics about the number of people who are algorithm aware. Studies have found evidence of algorithmic anxiety[23], leading to a deep imbalance of power between platforms that deploy algorithms and the users who depend on them[24]. A study of Facebook usage[25] found that when participants were made aware of Facebook's algorithm for curating news feeds, about 83% of participants modified their behavior to try to take advantage of the algorithm, while around 10% decreased their usage of Facebook. A November 2018 report from the Pew Research Center[26] found that a broad majority of the public had significant concerns about the use of algorithms for particular uses. It found that 66% thought it would not be fair for algorithms to calculate personal finance scores, while 57% said the same about automated resume screening. A small fraction of individuals exercise some control over how algorithms use their personal data. For example, the Hu-Manity platform allows users an option to control how much of their data is collected[27]. Online encyclopedia Everipedia[28] offers users the ability to be a stakeholder in the process of curation, which means that users can also control how information is aggregated and presented to them. However, a vast majority of platforms do not provide either such flexibility to their end users or the right to choose how the algorithm uses their preferences in curating their news feed or in recommending them content. If there are options, users may not know about them. About 74% of Facebook's users said in a survey that they were not aware of how the platform characterizes their personal interests[29]. In my view, the new digital literacy is not using a computer or being on the internet, but understanding and evaluating the consequences of an always-plugged-in lifestyle. This lifestyle has a meaningful impact on how people interact with others[30]; on their ability to pay attention to new information[31]; and on the complexity of their decision-making processes[32]. Increasing algorithmic anxiety may also be mirrored by parallel shifts in the economy. A small group of individuals are capturing the gains from automation[33], while many workers are in a precarious position[34]. Opting out from algorithmic curation is a luxury - and could one day be a symbol of affluence available to only a select few. The question is then what the measurable harms will be for those on the wrong side of the digital divide.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SQKv3/1/\">https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SQKv3/1/</url>[35] Anjana Susarla[36], Associate Professor of Information Systems, Michigan State University[37] This article is republished from The Conversation[38] under a Creative Commons license.

After 25 years, we've divided our traditional list into 10 groups of 10, illuminating more tribal aspects of the influence networks that define our world. Of course, modern power, catalyzed by technology, tends to transcend its categories. The Obamas have a Netflix deal. Rihanna is building a billion-dollar beauty empire. Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars. And Jeff Bezos is disrupting Hollywood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year has also been notable for the Establishment's conspicuous failings. In Silicon Valley, the #MeToo movement, and the Jeffrey Epstein saga, we find glaring indictments of ruling-class values. There's nothing more fascinating than power\u00ad-and nothing more dangerous.</p><h>Death to the New Establishment (Long May They Reign!)</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. AFTER YEARS OF SCANDALS, OUR NEW MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE APPEAR EVEN MORE RUTHLESS THAN THE OLD GUARD THEY DISPLACED</p><p>BY NICK BILTON</p><p>In San Francisco, the crown jewel of Silicon Valley, there are no poor neighborhoods, just poor people. Squeezed between million-dollar apartments and Michelin-starred restaurants is a rising tide of homelessness: vagrants begging for scraps from the tech zillionaires on Market Street, families who couldn't afford the rent after the latest IPO, Uber drivers sleeping in their cars in the Safeway parking lot. The nouveau wealth capital of America is a land of decadence and irony, where Juul (banned from selling e-cigarettes in the county) just bought a $400 million office tower and Vinod Khosla thinks he owns the beach. Farther down the 101 in Menlo Park and Sunnyvale, Facebook and Google employees are raising their kids tech-free.</p><p>This is the world the smartphone has built. In 1994, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VANITY FAIR</emphasis> inaugurated the New Establishment list to celebrate the rise of a new entrepreneurial class that promised-how young we were then!-to \"make the world a better place.\" They were digital-age whiz kids challenging the old boy's club, rebels and hackers getting their first taste of real power. Twenty-five years later, the upstarts are now the establishment, the undisputed titans of America's second gilded age.</p><p>How quickly it all changed. Twitter, which aided the Arab Spring, now abets America's culture civil war, and its cofounder Jack Dorsey is more concerned with going on silent retreats than silencing Nazis. Mark Zuckerberg, who dreamed of bringing free internet to Africa, spends his days dodging questions about the genocide in Myanmar. Dara Khosrowshahi has righted the amoral culture of Uber but is struggling to squeeze profits from its gig-economy workforce. (For SoftBank leader Masayoshi Son, self-driving cars can't come soon enough.) Even Slack, which was going to save us from the drudgery of work, has merely insinuated drudgery deeper into the fiber of our lives.</p><p>Unwinding the problems these entrepreneurs have wrought is difficult, as anyone on the 2019 New Establishment list can attest. YouTube's Susan Wojcicki has spoken passionately of \"trying to strike a balance\" between removing hate speech and cultivating free expression but is quick with excuses when pressed on the specifics (\"If we were to take down every video&amp;#230;\"). Poor Zuckerberg couldn't for the life of him figure out how to rid Facebook of anti-vaxxers or Russian bots-at least until regulators began threatening multibillion-dollar fines and high-profile tech insiders (including Tristan Harris and Roger McNamee) began speaking publicly about breaking up the company. \"Fish don't see water,\" one tech investor explained when I asked how Silicon Valley sees itself in this age of cultural backlash. Another senior-level tech employee, who has worked in the industry for more than a decade, wasn't so kind. \"I don't think they smell their own shit,\" she said.</p><p>There is still a sense of wonder: Elon Musk is planning a Mars colony; Satya Nadella is pouring money into artificial intelligence; Larry Page has invested in flying cars. Wojcicki's younger sister, Anne, is building a genetic database that is already being used to design new drugs (with a $300 million investment from Glaxo\u00adSmithKline) and fuel cutting-edge academic research. Jeff Bezos has teamed up with titans of the financial industry to lower health care costs, while Brian Armstrong's cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, aims to disrupt the financial industry altogether. In Hollywood, technology has forced the studios to compete with Netflix and Amazon, fueling another golden age of video.</p><p>Meanwhile, venture capital is flowing outward, remaking the world for better and worse. There are start-ups growing flawless diamonds with plasma reactors, plant-based meats that \"bleed\" beet juice, shoes made from eucalyptus fibers. One start-up founder I recently met is growing genetically modified mushrooms that can be turned into imitation leather for belts and shoes, reducing the need for cows and helping slow climate change. (A thousand artisan villages in India won't know what hit them.) Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape and one half of the eponymous V.C. firm Andreessen Horowitz, used to say that \"software eats the world.\" These days it feels more appropriate to say that \"Silicon Valley eats the world\"-or has eaten it already.</p><h>THE VALLEY</h><p>Visionaries and venture capitalists transforming the tech industry.

They pursued scraps of whispers and convinced very unwilling sources to speak out against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, all the while butting up against a legal system-white-shoe lawyers, corporate obfuscation, nondisclosure agreements-designed to protect him. The resulting expos\u00e9 divided the modern world into two distinct epochs: before the Weinstein story broke, and after.</p><p>There's definitely been a palpable shift in institutions and mores and minds. Workplaces have installed entire new rule books; media outlets are much more responsive to sexual scandal; and powerful men are on notice as to how they should behave. Yet on a deeper level, the effects of the #MeToo movement are harder to quantify. Women are still fighting for their place in politics and industry. Donald Trump remains in the White House despite multiple allegations of sexual assault. When writer E. Jean Carroll recently wrote, very believably, of being raped by Trump in a department-store dressing room in the mid 1990s, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> hardly treated it as news. (Trump has denied the allegation.) Meanwhile, men who have acknowledged sexual harassment and worse, who apologized and went underground, are now attempting to resurface.</p><p>Kantor and Twohey chronicle some of this paradigm shift in their new book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement,</emphasis> which presents a ticktock of their efforts to unmask Weinstein, as well as their reporting on Christine Blasey Ford's agonizing decision to testify against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. They go deeper on the topic here, parsing the systems that have failed, the movement that's picked up the slack, and the new reality it has left in its wake.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#METOO'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Megan Twohey:</emphasis> Our article in October 2017 felt like it was just the beginning. We had been able to connect some of the dots about Harvey Weinstein's decades of alleged predation and those who helped him, but there were still so many pressing questions. There was the question of the women who faced wrenching decisions as they debated whether or not to come forward and share their stories. There was the question of the machinery in place to silence those women and try to block our investigation.</p><p>We wanted to pull the curtain back on that machinery. And we wanted to get into the question of complicity. One of the most pressing questions when it comes to these individual predators is, this was somebody who was engaged in this behavior for decades. Who were the individuals and institutions that glimpsed that wrongdoing, and what did they do about it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jodi Kantor:</emphasis> We say in the beginning of the book, \"Thank you for witnessing what we witnessed, and hearing what we heard.\" We wanted to bring readers to ground zero and say, go through this process of examining this with us so you can have your own conversations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOURNALISM'S POWER-AND ITS LIMITS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JK:</emphasis> At a time when the president of the United States talks about journalists as enemies of the state, at a time when we've all been figuring out what the new financial model is for journalism, at a time when it feels like the truth is fracturing, I think Megan's and my response is to show our work. We are totally transparent about what goes into this, and this is an example of facts driving social change. The reaction to this story was so outsize, and #MeToo has become both an example and a test of social change in our time. We feel that we lived the experience of careful information actually moving the needle and having an impact on people's lives.</p><p>Since October of 2017 we've been flooded with messages from women who want to tell us their stories. And there have been times when we've felt overwhelmed, because there's no way that any publication, even a publication with the resources of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times,</emphasis> could ever get to every one of the stories. So many systems have failed, and of course we want journalism to step in and do what it can. But journalism can't compensate for an entire system that's broken.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE FUTURE OF A MOVEMENT</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JK:</emphasis> Like everyone else, we have been staggered by the size and durability of this movement. It doesn't feel like a news story anymore-it feels like a way of being. I think we all experienced it this summer with the Jeffrey Epstein story, which brings up a lot of the same questions as the Weinstein story: How could this have gone unaddressed or inadequately addressed for so long? How could so many people have been complicit? What is behind this seemingly prestigious world that is clearly masking something much darker? Epstein, like Weinstein, is a sprawling story that's shocking in the sheer number of allegations, the number of women who appear to have been hurt. We feel that you can't solve a problem you can't see, and all of us collectively are still in the process of seeing that problem clearly for the first time. And clearly we all have a lot of work to do on that.</p><p>We also understand that #MeToo has become controversial. Basically, there are three questions about #MeToo issues that are totally unresolved. One: What kind of behaviors are under scrutiny? Are we talking about Aziz Ansari? Yes or no? Two: How are we evaluating this information? What are the tools we're using to figure out what actually happened? And three: What's the punishment or accountability that we're going to use? Each of those three questions is a matter of huge debate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOW MUCH HAS #METOO CHANGED, REALLY?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MT:</emphasis> There's no question that some of the secrecy around sexual harassment and sexual assault has been shattered. For so long, as reporters looking to uncover these types of stories, we were the ones having people slam the door in our face. To have this reversal-in which tips and victims are now coming to us-is massively significant. At the same time, there hasn't been the type of systemic reform that both the accusers and the accused are looking for. For instance, secret settlements with restrictive clauses helped conceal the conduct of Harvey Weinstein for years. Those types of settlements are still being signed every single day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JK:</emphasis> It's confounding because everything's changed and nothing's changed. On the one hand, we've been through a seismic social shift and a change in attitude, and things that were accepted, tolerated, dismissed a couple of years ago are now taken much more seriously. I do think that, on a corporate level, people are aware that the reputational risk of protecting a predator is much greater than the reputational risk of doing something about it. The calculus has changed. On the other hand, our basic systems for preventing and dealing with these problems have barely changed at all. Nothing has happened that says to us, legally and structurally, the United States is taking a new approach to this problem.</p><p>I do think there's a private reckoning that's taken place alongside the public one, and in some ways the private one has been much more powerful. The public conversation about #MeToo has been loud and fractious and controversial. But in private conversations, whether they're in offices or in bars or among old friends, I think what you hear is a much more searching and delicate reevaluation of old behavior. You hear people allowing themselves to be vulnerable and to question things that happened years ago that they accepted that no longer seem right. Sometimes I think that, as reporters, we can never capture the true power of what's happened because one function of the news reporting and the public conversation is to drive these really significant private ones that most of us will never hear about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MT:</emphasis> We can't necessarily predict how systemic change will work, and how these reforms will come about and what they'll look like, but we can continue to do our jobs every day as reporters, which is to unearth and publish the facts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Streaming WarsDisney+</emphasis> November 12, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">$6.99 per month</emphasis> | <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple TV+</emphasis> November 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">$4.99 per month</emphasis> | <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HBO Max</emphasis> Spring 2020, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">$14.99 per month</emphasis> | <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peacock</emphasis> April 2020, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">$12 per month</emphasis> | <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quibi</emphasis> April 6, 2020, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">$4.99 per month (with ads), $7.99 per month (ad-free)</emphasis> | <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discovery/BBC Studio</emphasis> 2020, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">less than $5 per month</emphasis></p><h>M&amp;A Power Ranking</h><p>Which media conglomerate is holding the best hand?</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disney</emphasis><br/>Marvel (now including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deadpool</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X-Men</emphasis>), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars, Avatar, The Simpsons, Toy Story</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WarnerMedia</emphasis><br/>DC Comics, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Westworld, Watchmen, His Dark Materials</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, The Dark Tower</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Chronicles of Narnia, Stranger Things, The Witcher,</emphasis> the Roald Dahl library, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cowboy Bebop</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fast &amp; Furious, Shrek, Jurassic Park,</emphasis> Minions, Universal Classic Monsters, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Purge</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Highest-Paid Actors of 2019</h><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"368\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">DWAYNE JOHNSON</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">$89.4M</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">CHRIS HEMSWORTH</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">$76.4M</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">ROBERT DOWNEY JR.</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">$66M</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">AKSHAY KUMAR</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">$65M</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">JACKIE CHAN</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">$58M</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Credit: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis></p><h>THE NEW HOLLYWOOD</h><p>In a world dominated by streaming, old Hollywood has gone high-tech</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>TED <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SARANDOS</emphasis>Netflix chief content officer, Hollywood disruptor <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AGE:</emphasis> 55In the streaming wars, Sarandos is a general under siege, but with 151 million paid subscribers, his position appears to be strong and defensible-for now. \"We're betting in all the areas of content that our consumers love,\" he has assured investors.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>BOB <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GREENBLATT</emphasis>WarnerMedia Entertainment chairman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AGE:</emphasis> 59Richard Plepler's successor has promised to \"increase the volume\" without spoiling HBO's secret sauce.

AND IN HIS EXTREME ENTITLEMENT AND HEEDLESSNESS, HE MIRRORED ESTABLISHMENT VALUES</p><p>BY GABRIEL SHERMAN</p><p>Jeffrey Epstein once told a billionaire that he'd invented the derivatives market-a claim that is totally false. But without question, he helped create one of the signal trades of the last few decades. He came to prominence in the 1990s, as the modern meritocracy was taking shape in the collision between the cult of technology and the burgeoning class of billionaires. Epstein played a role in this marriage. He was one of the people who figured out how to arbitrage the particular needs, desires, and vulnerabilities of these groups. He recognized, long before others, that Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Park Avenue, and the Academy were converging around a new salon culture embodied by TED Talks and \"billionaires dinners.\" Genius wanted to ride on a private plane-it <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">deserved</emphasis> to travel by private plane. And billionaires wanted to certify their own genius by conversing with other geniuses. MIT and Harvard were brand names the superrich wanted to associate with, a fact that dropout Epstein understood innately. Science was sexy, a way to beat the markets. He once told an academic that he gamed the stock market by studying mating patterns of termites. Epstein grasped that, for the new meritocrats, genius and great wealth were two sides of the same coin, and that the health of capitalism inevitably required both. The girls-he always called them girls-were there too. For many in his glittery circle, they were decoration, seen but not heard or touched. None of them raised alarms about this situation-a person of means did not have to live by the rest of the world's rules.</p><p>Epstein's own Brooklyn accent and lack of a college degree, his idiosyncratic background, were no hindrance here but somehow a badge of his special gifts. He was mysterious, boundary pushing, living in that strange house, as big as an embassy, the former Birch Wathen school on 71st Street.</p><p>Then and now, no one knew exactly how he made his money. Beyond his having managed money for the apparel billionaire Les Wexner, Epstein's only public client, who knew what to believe? The former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne told people Epstein made a killing trading foreign currencies. Apollo Global Management cofounder Leon Black told colleagues Epstein was the smartest tax adviser he'd ever met. Epstein was said to run money for the Rockefellers and the Bronfmans, though both denied it.</p><p>A longtime Epstein employee confided in friends that she still has no idea what her boss actually did for a living. \"He'd call the office and say he wanted her to find a $10,000 umbrella he saw in Paris and she'd have to buy it. He was very, very demanding. But you weren't allowed to ask questions. It was not a normal coworker relationship,\" a source, familiar with how Epstein's office ran, recalled.</p><p>Epstein's glib confidence was validating to a cohort that craves sure things. In this way, he had some resemblance to figures like Donald Trump, Bernie Madoff, Elizabeth Holmes. Jonathan Farkas, an heir to the Alexander's department store fortune, recalled meeting Epstein in the Hamptons during the recession of 1982 and being buoyed by Epstein's absolute certainty that he knew where the economy was going. \"I'll never forget this. The stock market had dropped to around 700 points from 1,000. And one day Jeffrey just said, 'You'll never see it below 1,000 for the rest of your life. It will never go down,' \" Farkas told me. \"He was right.\"</p><p>And in those circles, he was clubbable. \"He's incredibly glib. He's charming. He's quick,\" one acquaintance, a Wall Street player, recalled. His casualness-the sweatshirts, the jeans-were an aggression, keeping his people off-balance. \"Epstein treated the fanciest people in the world with complete irreverence in a way they were unaccustomed to. He let it be known he called Prince Andrew 'Andy,' \" the Wall Streeter told me. He presented his interest in women as another noble eccentricity-he never hid it. Epstein reportedly once told an academic he only had two interests: \"science and pussy.\"</p><p>Epstein had an arsenal of self-presentations, depending on his audience. \"He was one of these people who didn't talk much. He wanted you to think he was thinking profound thoughts. You always wondered if there was any <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">there</emphasis> there,\" a private equity executive who dealt with Epstein told me.</p><p>But a constant was his social braggadocio, both vanity and part of his method. \"He name-dropped like crazy. You'd be with him and he'd say things like, 'I just got off the phone with Zuckerberg. I just got off the phone with Rothschild. I just got off the phone with Gates,' \" recalled another Wall Streeter who did business with him. Epstein boasted about buying yachts and planes and setting up arcane tax shelters for the superrich. \"You didn't know if any of it was true. But then you'd be meeting at his townhouse several days later and Gates would be there. Jeffrey had a way of making these people materialize.\"</p><p>Scientists were the central currency in this social trade, supplying intellectual heft while certifying him as a man of science, which he wasn't, though he had no shortage of loopy ideas, which reportedly included a plan for Epstein to impregnate dozens of women at his New Mexico ranch to improve humanity with his DNA. Epstein began courting academics in the early 1990s at a moment when geek culture was rapidly gaining power. This was due in large measure to the promotion of Epstein's friend, the New York literary agent and entrepreneur John Brockman, who transformed academics like Jared Diamond, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Steven Pinker into best-selling authors.</p><p>With Brockman's imprimatur, Epstein spent heavily to buy into the Academy, becoming known as a \"science philanthropist\" with a Cheshire smile and a baggy Harvard sweatshirt. He pledged $30 million to Harvard, f\u00eated academics at Champagne-fueled dinners at his 21,000-square-foot townhouse, hosted science conferences on his private Caribbean island, and jetted them around on his 727.</p><p>Not every scientist bought Epstein's lines. Dennett recalled being summoned to a private meeting at Epstein's townhouse and thinking he was a phony. \"He asked me manipulative questions, as a conversational gambit. I remember he said, 'Suppose I gave you a billion dollars, what would you do with it?' I said I would fund an independent news organization for the whole world, and we'd hire the best reporters and give away the journalism. He had no interest in my answer. It was about showing off his wealth.\"</p><p>Pinker recalled a flight on Epstein's plane to a TED conference: \"At one point I was summoned for an audience with Epstein in his 'office' on the plane, which included an incongruous big wooden desk and executive chair. I had been told that Epstein had a brilliant mind and was interested in the cutting edge of science-consciousness, genetics, evolution, cosmology-and that he wanted to discuss my work with me. He would ask me a question, get bored with my answer after a sentence, interrupt me, ask another question, impatiently interrupt me again, and so on, in a conversation that lasted perhaps 10 minutes before I was dismissed and could return to the more satisfying conversations at the back of the plane,\" Pinker said. \"Epstein's ADD and intellectual laziness led me to conclude he was a kibitzer who liked to hang out with intellectual celebrities he had bought, and I wanted no part of him, though could not avoid him entirely because he would pop up at events he'd partly funded. This was years before anyone knew about his sexual crimes.\" Most of Epstein's friends and acquaintances did not abuse the women in his world. But almost no one (including journalists) pointed out the oddness of a middle-aged man traveling with several young women. It's as if his wealth-and this was what he thought-justified this behavior.</p><p>Epstein's suicide while imprisoned at one of the world's most secure jails-El Chapo, Bernie Madoff, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombers were housed there-will provide him with a perfect elitist afterlife of conspiracy theories: Did Mossad kill him, to cover up that Epstein was an agent running an underage honey\u00adpot operation designed to gather <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">kompromat</emphasis> on intelligence targets, people asked. Was it superrich friends, for whom he'd outlived his usefulness? Was it&amp;#230;Hillary Clinton? Trump, not surprisingly, retweeted a theory to that effect.</p><p>But the truth may be simpler, and uglier. In his staggering entitlement, his narcissism, his heedlessness, his numerous self-justifications, unapologetic elitism, Epstein is a mirror of the modern establishment. When the grift stops working, why stay alive?</p><h>THE ROCKEFELLERS</h><p>In the age of social capital, philanthropy is the ultimate power trip</p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"368\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"center\" colname=\"col1\">1MACKENZIE BEZOSAGE: 49</entry><entry align=\"center\" colname=\"col2\">Signed the Giving Pledge soon after divorcing the world's richest man.

It would be better if I were wrong, but I have doubts about this scenario. It appears to assume some orderliness in the responses to the coronavirus, both in terms of businesses and governments cooperating. I don't see this as possible in the US. </p><p>Not only is there an absence of public spiritedness, government is not trusted. And that's not an uninformed view. The US in incapable of mounting a New Deal or war mobilization level response. It lacks the operational capacity. And too many people in power are in it for themselves. Things may be better in a lot of the rest of the world in terms of social and political cohesiveness, but few countries are as close to being an autarky as the US (Russia is probably the best candidate), and so the breakdown of global supply chains is likely to hit them even harder. Similarly, if concerns that getting Covid-19 confers only short-term immunity (say a year or less), then investing in tracking who has contacted it for the purpose of deeming individuals to be safe from a travel/visa standpoint is a waste of effort.  I suspect Grasmsci is the best seer: The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear. By Marshall Auerback, a market analyst and commentator and Jan Ritch-Frel, the executive director of the Independent Media Institute[1]. Produced by Economy for All[2], a project of the Independent Media Institute The coronavirus pandemic has upended the global economic system, and just as importantly, cast out 40 years of neoliberal orthodoxy that dominated the industrialized world. Forget about the 'new world order[3].' Offshoring and global supply chains are out; regional and local production is in. Market fundamentalism is pass; regulation is the norm. Public health is now more valuable than just-in-time supply systems. Stockpiling and industrial capacity suddenly make more sense, which may have future implications in the recently revived antitrust debate[4] in the U.S. Biodata will drive the next phase of social management and surveillance, with near-term consequences for the way countries handle immigration and customs. Health care and education will become digitally integrated the way newspapers and television were 10 years ago. Health care itself will increasingly be seen as a necessary public good, rather than a private right, until now in the U.S. predicated on age, employment or income levels. Each of these will produce political tensions within their constituencies and in the society generally as they adapt to the new normal. This political sea change doesn't represent a sudden conversion to full-on socialism, but simply a case of minimizing our future risks of infection by providing full-on universal coverage. Beyond that, as Professor Michael Sandel has argued[5], one has to query the 'moral logic' of providing 'coronavirus treatment for the uninsured,' while leaving 'health coverage in ordinary times to the market' (especially when our concept of what constitutes 'ordinary times' has been upended). Internationally, there will be many positive and substantial international shifts to address overdue global public health needs and accords on mitigating climate change. And it is finally dawning on Western-allied economic planners that the military price tag that made so-called cheap oil and cheap labor possible is vastly higher than investment in advanced research and next-generation manufacturing. This also means that the old North (developed world) versus South (emerging world) division that long preoccupied scholars and policymakers in the post-World War II period[6] will become increasingly stark again, particularly for those emerging economies that have hitherto attracted investment largely on the grounds of being repositories of low-cost labor. They will now find themselves picking sides as they seek assistance in an increasingly divided and multipolar world. The fault lines of the next economic era have already begun to surface, creating friction with the previous international structure of banking and finance, trade and industry. There is a force beyond elites and critical industries driving this: The proletariat has literally become the 'precariat.' In the U.S. and Europe, the staggering number of service economy workers are going to be quickly politicized by the shortfalls: People have seen a collapse in income, and big failures in education, and health care. Union-busting, pension fleecing, and austerity budgets and new technologies that concentrate wealth away from labor have created a circumstance where ownership and profit models must be revisited to sustain stability. The needs are too acute to be distracted by the lies of Trump, or the inadequate responses in other parts of the industrialized world.The current crisis will likely prompt geopolitical and economic shifts and dislocations we haven't seen since World War II. Death of Chimerica, the Rise of New Production Blocs One of the biggest casualties of the current order is the breakdown of 'Chimerica[7],' the decades-old nexus between the U.S. and Chinese economies, along with other leading countries' partnerships with Chinese manufacturing. While the geopolitics of blame for the origins of coronavirus continue to shake out, the process that saw a decrease in exports from China to the U.S. from $816 billion in 2018 to $757 billion in 2019[8] will accelerate and intensify over the next decade. While a decoupling is unlikely to lead to armed conflict, a Cold War style of competition could emerge as a new global fault line. Much as the Cold War did not preclude some degree of collaboration between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, so too today there may still be areas of cooperation between Washington and Beijing from climate to public health, advanced research to weapons proliferation. Nor does this shift necessarily spell the sudden collapse of Chinese power or influence\u2014it has a colossal and still-growing domestic market and is on the international leaderboard for a wide range of advanced indicators. But its status as the world's most desirable offshore manufacturing hub is a thing of the past, along with the economic stability that steady inflows of foreign capital brought with it. It does show a susceptibility to domestic stress, with the Hong Kong protests last year providing a hint of what is in store as the party leadership can't pivot to new realities that include slower economic growth and declining foreign investment. As investment flows turn inward back to industrialized countries, there will likely be corresponding diminution of the global labor arbitrage emanating from the emerging world. In general, that's a negative for the global South, but potentially a positive factor for workers elsewhere, whose wages and living standards have stagnated for decades as they lost jobs to competing overseas low-cost manufacturing centers (the increase in inequality is principally[9] a product of 40 years of sustained attacks on unions). The jobs won't be the same, but to be sure, manufacturing incomes exceed those of the service industry. As each country adopts a 'sauve-qui-peut[10]' mentality, businesses and investors are drawing the necessary conclusions. Coronavirus has been a wake-up call, as countries trying to import medical goods from existing global supply chains face a shortage of air and ocean freight options[11] to ship goods back to home markets. Already, the Japanese government has announced its plans 'to spend over $2 billion to help its country's firms move production out of China,' according to the Spectator Index[12]. The EU leadership[13] is publicly indicating a policy of subsidy and state investment in companies to prevent Chinese buyouts or undercutting prices. Two billion dollars is small potatoes compared to what is likely to be spent by the U.S. and other countries going forward. And it can't simply be done via research and development tax credits. The state can and must drive this redomiciling process in other ways: via local content requirements (LCRs)[14], tariffs, quotas and/or government procurement local sourcing requirements. And with a $750-billion-plus budget, the U.S. military will likely play a role here, as it ponders disruptions from overseas supply sources[15]. Of course, if the U.S. does this, other parts of the world\u2014China, the EU, Japan\u2014will likely do the same, which will accelerate the regionalization trends in trade. This may mean that some U.S. firms will have to operate in foreign markets through local subsidiaries with local content preferences and local workforces (that is how it worked in the 1920s\u2014Ford UK was a mostly local British company, different from the U.S. Ford Motor Company, but with shared profits). An examination of U.S. planning for the post-1945 world reveals the emphasis was on free trade in raw materials mostly, not finished goods. (The U.S. only adopted one-way 'free trade' with its Asian and European allies later as a Cold War measure to accelerate their development and keep them in the American orbit.) Domestically within the U.S., as Dalia Marin writes[16], the coming declines in interest rates will accelerate 'robot adoption' by 75.7 percent, with concentration 'in the sectors that are most exposed to global value chains. In Germany, that means autos and transport equipment, electronics, and textiles\u2014industries that import around 12 percent of their inputs from low-wage countries. Globally, the industries where the most reshoring activity is taking place are chemicals, metal products, and electrical products and electronics.' As the coronavirus pandemic is illustrating, a viable industrial ecosystem cannot work effectively if it is dispersed to too many geographic extremities or there are insufficient redundancies built into the transportation of goods back into the home market (rail, highway, etc.). Proximity has become a significant competitive advantage for manufacturers, and a strategic advantage for governments. But the U.S. government must play an expanded role in the planning process. The U.S. is still a leader in many high-tech areas, but is suffering the consequences of a generation-long effort to undermine the government's natural role as an economic planner. In the form of the regionalized blocs that are being sketched, in the Americas, Mexico is likely to be one of the leading recipients of American foreign direct investment (FDI). It already has a $17 billion medical device industry[17] and is sure to absorb much more capacity from China. This has already started to happen as a result of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or new NAFTA)[18]. Furthermore, the Washington Post reports[19] that '[a]s demand soars for medical devices and personal protective equipment in the fight against the coronavirus, the United States has turned to the phalanx of factories south of the border that are now the outfitters of many U.S. hospitals.' This is in addition to the thousands of assembly plants already in place[20] in Mexico since the establishment of NAFTA. Indeed, if the jobs that had moved to China move to Mexico, Central America, and South America, this likely addresses many long-standing social tensions in regard to immigration management, currency imbalances and corresponding black market industries (ironically, it also likely means the end of Trump's wall, as the industrial ecosystem of the Americas becomes more cohesive and widespread). Big Business Is Good Business But this will also have significant impacts closer to home: Much as Franklin Delano Roosevelt ultimately prioritized domestic ramp-ups in wartime production over trust-busting[21], so too national champions are likely to feature more prominently today, as domestic scale and balance sheet strength are given precedence to accommodate the drive to revive employment quickly, and work collaboratively to halt the spread of the coronavirus[22]. The scale of companies will not be regarded as a political problem if they can both deliver for consumers and show the capacity of following political direction for what the public's needs are. Tech companies like Apple and Google are stepping up to fill the void left by massive federal government dysfunction[23]. The 'break up Big Tech[24]' voices are nowhere to be heard at the moment. We still need a more robust form of regulation for these corporate behemoths, but via a system of regulation that is 'function-centric,' rather than size-centric. As co-author Marshall Auerback has written before[25], this kind of regulation 'restricts the range of corporate activities (e.g., structural separation so as to prevent companies like Amazon and Google from owning both the platform as well as participating as a seller on that platform), or the prices such companies can charge (as regulators often do for utilities or railways). These considerations would be 'size neutral': they would apply independently of corporate size per se.' Capitalism has always had its plutocrats, but scaling back America's overly financialized model (by preventing stock buybacks, to cite one example) would represent a useful reform and prevent a lot of economic waste. Instead of going to enrich executives and shareholders beyond the dreams of Croesus[26], that measure might help to ensure that the profits of these companies will be directed to the workers' wages (which also means supporting increased unionization), or plowed back into investment (e.g., increased robotics). Biodata, Privacy, and an End to Pandemic Profiteering And there are fault lines in the business world. The pharmaceutical and medical research industries face immense pressure from other businesses to end the pandemic so they can get back to profitability. That means temporarily setting aside profits and pooling intellectual property to encourage collaborative efforts on the part of biotech and pharmaceutical companies to find proper treatments for COVID-19, and make them freely available, especially if governments were to waive antitrust scrutiny in exchange for all of the data Big Pharma companies collectively hold. As the Guardian reports[27], '[t]here is a precedent. Last June, 10 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies\u2014including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline\u2014announced they would pool data[28] for an AI-based search for new antibiotics, which are urgently needed as antibiotic-resistant bacteria have proliferated across the world, threatening the growth of untreatable disease.' Privacy advocates are already expressing concerns[29] about a growing and overweening medical surveillance state. These surveillance concerns lack historical context: From the 19th century on, serious health problems were met by hardline government policies to reduce them. Policies ranging from quarantine to vaccine were not always mandatory, but there was an understanding that personal concessions had to be made to manage a huge population and an advanced society; the Constitution was not a suicide pact. We can further alleviate those concerns today by ensuring that the information uncovered does not become a precondition or additional cost of receiving insurance coverage. In light of coronavirus, cost savings of incorporating biodata into immigration and customs are a no-brainer for governments, and are certain to cause friction with individuals who may not want to give blood or saliva to get a visa or work permit, and agribusiness leaders who know that safety measures cut into profitability. But the scales have tipped in the other direction. North Versus South What about the other countries in the developing world that don't have close geographic proximity to a home market, or abundant supplies of key commodities required for 21st-century manufacturing needs, or even a well-developed manufacturing base (in other words, the countries that have hitherto been large recipients of investment solely on the grounds of cheap labor)? Many of them have faced immediate pressure with the collapse in global trade, unprecedented capital flight that is sure to grow as the coronavirus spreads, all the while coping with COVID-19 with highly inadequate health systems. In the meantime, the multi-trillion-dollar market for emerging market debt[30], both sovereign bonds and commercial paper, has collapsed. Many of these countries, via their state pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, have become the ultimate endpoint for many of the newer asset-backed securities that finally revived years after the 2008 financial crisis. This has become the potential new stress point in the $52 trillion 'shadow banking[31]' market. The U.S. Federal Reserve has sought to ease the funding stresses of much of the developing economies by offering central bank swap lines. It has also broadened prime dealer collateral acceptance rules, and set up commercial paper swap facilities, all of which have eased short-term funding pressures in these economies that have incurred substantial dollar liabilities. As the emerging world central banks then start to lend on those lines to their own banks, it should start to alleviate the shortage of dollars in the offshore dollar funding markets. We are starting to see some easing of stresses, notably in Indonesia[32]\u2014because it's an exporter of resources more than a cheap labor price economy. But whereas in previous emerging markets crises, China was able to buttress these economies via initiatives such as the 'Belt and Road Initiative[33],' Beijing itself is likely to be buffeted by the twin shocks of declining global trade and a reversal of foreign direct investment, which declined 8.6 percent in the first two months of this year[34]. Longer-term, many other countries face comparable challenges to China: Capital controls, collapsing domestic currencies, and widespread debt defaults are likely to become the norm. That's already happened to serial defaulter Argentina again[35]. South Africa has been downgraded to junk status[36]. Turkey remains vulnerable. The so-called 'BRICS' economies\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014are all sinking like bricks. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus and likely future pandemics will create additional stresses on developing economies that depend on their labor price advantage in the international marketplace to survive. By contrast, countries like South Korea and Taiwan have had a 'good crisis.' Both have vibrant manufacturing sectors and created successful multiparty democracies. Foreign investment in South Korea[37] continued to grow in the first quarter of this year, as it rapidly moved to contain the spread of COVID-19 through an extensive testing regime (while keeping its economy open). Similarly in Taiwan, by activating a national emergency response system launched in 2004 (following the SARS virus), that country has mounted a thoroughly competent coronavirus intervention of unprecedented effectiveness[38]. The results speak for themselves: as of April 15, in South Korea, a mere 225 deaths[39], while in Taiwan, an astonishingly low total of six deaths[40] in a country of 24 million people\u2014this despite far more exposure to infected Chinese visitors than Italy, Spain or the U.S. Of course, the very success of Taiwan's response revives another potential fault line, namely the tension underlying the 'One China'[41] policy. Before COVID-19, it is noteworthy that the WHO 'even refused to publicly report Taiwan's cases of SARS until public pressure prompted numbers to be published under the label of 'Taiwan, province of China,'' according to Dr. Anish Koka[42]. At the very least, Taiwan's divergent approach and success at fighting the pandemic will bolster its pro-independence factions. The question of foreign nations upholding Taiwan's sovereignty with regard to China is increasingly thorny, given Beijing's growing military capacities. This will present an ongoing diplomatic challenge to Western parties who seek to increase engagement with Taipei without heightening tensions in the region. A Recalculation of 'Economic Value' We have outlined many fault lines likely to be exposed or exacerbated as a consequence of COVID-19. Happily, there is one fault line likely to be slammed shut: namely, the false dichotomy that has long existed between economic growth and environmentalism. The Global Assessment from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services[43] reports that 'land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23 percent of the global land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at risk from pollinator loss and 100-300 million people are at increased risk of floods and hurricanes because of loss of coastal habitats and protection.' Likewise, the study cites the fact that as of 2015, 33 percent of marine fish stocks 'were being harvested at unsustainable levels,' and notes the rise of plastic pollution (which 'has increased tenfold since 1980[44]'), both of which play a key role in degrading ecosystems in a manner that ultimately destroys economic growth. Finally, repeated pandemics over the past few decades have shown these are not blips, but recurrent features of today's world. Hence, there is an increasing public appetite for regulation to deal with this ongoing problem. Some industries, such as agribusinesses, won't like this, but the concerns are well-founded. According to expert Josh Balk[45], 75 percent of new diseases start in domestic and wild-caught animals, and 2.2 million people die each year from illnesses transferred from animals. The majority of these are transferred from poorly regulated factory farm chickens, cows and pigs; still, the 'wet markets'[46] of Asia and Africa, and the trade in potential 'transfer species[47],' such as pangolins, a major driver of the $19 billion-a-year[48] global trade in illegal wildlife, must also be addressed. Beijing has suggested it will ban trade in illegal wildlife and seek tighter regulation of the wet markets[49]. The latter in particular may be easier said than done, according to Dr. Zhenzhong Si[50], a research associate at Canada's University of Waterloo who specializes in Chinese food security, sustainability, and rural development. Dr. Si argued that[51] '[b]anning wet markets is not only going to be impossible, but will also be destructive for urban food security in China as they play such a pivotal role in ensuring urban residents' access to affordable and healthy food.' To be fair, this isn't the first time that the sacred tenets of the global economic framework have dealt with a crisis that seemed to usher in a new era. The same thing happened in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. But that was largely seen as a financial crisis, a product of faulty global financial plumbing that nobody truly understood, as opposed to a widespread social collapse closely approximating the conditions of the Great Depression as we have today. Not only has the current lockdown put the entire global economy into deep freeze, but it also came amidst a backdrop of widespread political and social upheaval, and a faux recovery whose fruits were largely restricted to the top tier. A collateralized debt obligation is not intuitively easy to grasp. By contrast, being forced to stay at home, deprived of vital income and isolated from loved ones, while health care workers perish from overwork and lack of protective gear, is a different order of magnitude. Even as we re-integrate, it is hard to envisage a return to the 'old normal.' Trade patterns will change. Self-sufficiency and geographic proximity will be prioritized over global integration. There will be new winners and losers, but it is worth noting that the model of capitalism we are describing\u2014one that does not feature obscenely overcompensated CEO pay co-existing with serf labor and the widespread offshoring of manufacturing\u2014has existed in different forms in the U.S. from 1945 into the 1980s, and still exists in parts of Europe (Germany) and East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) to this day. Our everyday lives will be impacted as selective quarantines and some forms of social distancing become the new normal (much as they were when we dealt with tuberculosis epidemics). All of this has implications for a multitude of industries: restaurants, leisure, travel, tourism, sporting events, entertainment, and media, as well as our evolving definition of 'essential' industries. Even our concept of personal privacy will likely have to be amended, especially in regard to medical matters. Concerns about medical surveillance\u2014stigma (STDs, alcoholism, mental illness) and denial of insurance\u2014can be alleviated if everyone is guaranteed treatment regardless of ability to pay, which will mean greater government intrusion into the lives of citizens and activities of businesses as the public sector seeks to socialize costs. Taken in aggregate, we are about to experience the most profound social, economic and political changes since World War II.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/04/the-new-fault-lines-in-a-post-globalized-world.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/04/the-new-fault-lines-in-a-post-globalized-world.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Doomsday scenarios[52], Economic fundamentals[53], Free markets and their discontents[54], Globalization[55], Guest Post[56], Health care[57], Pandemic[58], Politics[59], Social policy[60], Social values[61], The destruction of the middle class[62] on April 16, 2020[63] by Yves Smith[64].

Offshoring and global supply chains are out; regional and local production is in. Market fundamentalism is pass\u00e9; regulation is the norm. Public health is now more valuable than just-in-time supply systems. Stockpiling and industrial capacity suddenly make more sense, which may have future implications in the recently revived antitrust debate in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biodata will drive the next phase of social management and surveillance, with near-term consequences for the way countries handle immigration and customs. Health care and education will become digitally integrated the way newspapers and television were 10 years ago. Health care itself will increasingly be seen as a necessary public good, rather than a private right, until now in the U.S. predicated on age, employment or income levels. Each of these will produce political tensions within their constituencies and in the society generally as they adapt to the new normal.</p><p>This political sea change doesn't represent a sudden conversion to full-on socialism, but simply a case of minimizing our future risks of infection by providing full-on universal coverage. Beyond that, as Professor Michael Sandel has argued, one has to query the 'moral logic' of providing 'coronavirus treatment for the uninsured,' while leaving 'health coverage in ordinary times\u2026 to the market' (especially when our concept of what constitutes 'ordinary times' has been upended).</p><p>Internationally, there will be many positive and substantial international shifts to address overdue global public health needs and accords on mitigating climate change. And it is finally dawning on Western-allied economic planners that the military price tag that made so-called cheap oil and cheap labor possible is vastly higher than investment in advanced research and next-generation manufacturing.</p><p>This also means that the old North (developed world) versus South (emerging world) division that long preoccupied scholars and policymakers in the post-World War II period will become increasingly stark again, particularly for those emerging economies that have hitherto attracted investment largely on the grounds of being repositories of low-cost labor. They will now find themselves picking sides as they seek assistance in an increasingly divided and multipolar world.</p><p>The fault lines of the next economic era have already begun to surface, creating friction with the previous international structure of banking and finance, trade and industry. There is a force beyond elites and critical industries driving this: The proletariat has literally become the 'precariat.'</p><p>In the U.S. and Europe, the staggering number of service economy workers are going to be quickly politicized by the shortfalls: People have seen a collapse in income, and big failures in education, and health care. Union-busting, pension fleecing, and austerity budgets and new technologies that concentrate wealth away from labor have created a circumstance where ownership and profit models must be revisited to sustain stability. The needs are too acute to be distracted by the lies of Trump, or the inadequate responses in other parts of the industrialized world. The current crisis will likely prompt geopolitical and economic shifts and dislocations we haven't seen since World War II.</p><p>Death of Chimerica, the Rise of New Production Blocs</p><p>One of the biggest casualties of the current order is the breakdown of 'Chimerica,' the decades-old nexus between the U.S. and Chinese economies, along with other leading countries' partnerships with Chinese manufacturing. While the geopolitics of blame for the origins of coronavirus continue to shake out, the process that saw a decrease in exports from China to the U.S. from $816 billion in 2018 to $757 billion in 2019 will accelerate and intensify over the next decade.</p><p>While a decoupling is unlikely to lead to armed conflict, a Cold War style of competition could emerge as a new global fault line. Much as the Cold War did not preclude some degree of collaboration between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, so too today there may still be areas of cooperation between Washington and Beijing from climate to public health, advanced research to weapons proliferation.</p><p>Nor does this shift necessarily spell the sudden collapse of Chinese power or influence-it has a colossal and still-growing domestic market and is on the international leaderboard for a wide range of advanced indicators. But its status as the world's most desirable offshore manufacturing hub is a thing of the past, along with the economic stability that steady inflows of foreign capital brought with it. It does show a susceptibility to domestic stress, with the Hong Kong protests last year providing a hint of what is in store as the party leadership can't pivot to new realities that include slower economic growth and declining foreign investment.</p><p>As investment flows turn inward back to industrialized countries, there will likely be corresponding diminution of the global labor arbitrage emanating from the emerging world. In general, that's a negative for the global South, but potentially a positive factor for workers elsewhere, whose wages and living standards have stagnated for decades as they lost jobs to competing overseas low-cost manufacturing centers (the increase in inequality is principally a product of 40 years of sustained attacks on unions). The jobs won't be the same, but to be sure, manufacturing incomes exceed those of the service industry.</p><p>As each country adopts a 'sauve-qui-peut' mentality, businesses and investors are drawing the necessary conclusions. Coronavirus has been a wake-up call, as countries trying to import medical goods from existing global supply chains face a shortage of air and ocean freight options to ship goods back to home markets. Already, the Japanese government has announced its plans 'to spend over $2 billion to help its country's firms move production out of China,' according to the Spectator Index. The EU leadership is publicly indicating a policy of subsidy and state investment in companies to prevent Chinese buyouts or undercutting prices.</p><p>Two billion dollars is small potatoes compared to what is likely to be spent by the U.S. and other countries going forward. And it can't simply be done via research and development tax credits. The state can and must drive this redomiciling process in other ways: via local content requirements (LCRs), tariffs, quotas and/or government procurement local sourcing requirements. And with a $750-billion-plus budget, the U.S. military will likely play a role here, as it ponders disruptions from overseas supply sources.</p><p>Of course, if the U.S. does this, other parts of the world-China, the EU, Japan-will likely do the same, which will accelerate the regionalization trends in trade. This may mean that some U.S. firms will have to operate in foreign markets through local subsidiaries with local content preferences and local workforces (that is how it worked in the 1920s-Ford UK was a mostly local British company, different from the U.S. Ford Motor Company, but with shared profits).</p><p>An examination of U.S. planning for the post-1945 world reveals the emphasis was on free trade in raw materials mostly, not finished goods. (The U.S. only adopted one-way 'free trade' with its Asian and European allies later as a Cold War measure to accelerate their development and keep them in the American orbit.)</p><p>Domestically within the U.S., as Dalia Marin writes, the coming declines in interest rates will accelerate 'robot adoption' by 75.7 percent, with concentration 'in the sectors that are most exposed to global value chains. In Germany, that means autos and transport equipment, electronics, and textiles-industries that import around 12 percent of their inputs from low-wage countries. \u2026 Globally, the industries where the most reshoring activity is taking place are chemicals, metal products, and electrical products and electronics.'</p><p>As the coronavirus pandemic is illustrating, a viable industrial ecosystem cannot work effectively if it is dispersed to too many geographic extremities or there are insufficient redundancies built into the transportation of goods back into the home market (rail, highway, etc.). Proximity has become a significant competitive advantage for manufacturers, and a strategic advantage for governments. But the U.S. government must play an expanded role in the planning process. The U.S. is still a leader in many high-tech areas, but is suffering the consequences of a generation-long effort to undermine the government's natural role as an economic planner.</p><p>In the form of the regionalized blocs that are being sketched, in the Americas, Mexico is likely to be one of the leading recipients of American foreign direct investment (FDI). It already has a $17 billion medical device industry and is sure to absorb much more capacity from China. This has already started to happen as a result of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or new NAFTA). Furthermore, the Washington Post reports that '[a]s demand soars for medical devices and personal protective equipment in the fight against the coronavirus, the United States has turned to the phalanx of factories south of the border that are now the outfitters of many U.S. hospitals.' This is in addition to the thousands of assembly plants already in place in Mexico since the establishment of NAFTA. Indeed, if the jobs that had moved to China move to Mexico, Central America, and South America, this likely addresses many long-standing social tensions in regard to immigration management, currency imbalances and corresponding black market industries (ironically, it also likely means the end of Trump's wall, as the industrial ecosystem of the Americas becomes more cohesive and widespread).</p><p>Big Business Is Good Business</p><p>But this will also have significant impacts closer to home: Much as Franklin Delano Roosevelt ultimately prioritized domestic ramp-ups in wartime production over trust-busting, so too national champions are likely to feature more prominently today, as domestic scale and balance sheet strength are given precedence to accommodate the drive to revive employment quickly, and work collaboratively to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The scale of companies will not be regarded as a political problem if they can both deliver for consumers and show the capacity of following political direction for what the public's needs are. Tech companies like Apple and Google are stepping up to fill the void left by massive federal government dysfunction. The 'break up Big Tech' voices are nowhere to be heard at the moment.</p><p>We still need a more robust form of regulation for these corporate behemoths, but via a system of regulation that is 'function-centric,' rather than size-centric. As co-author Marshall Auerback has written before, this kind of regulation 'restricts the range of corporate activities (e.g., structural separation so as to prevent companies like Amazon and Google from owning both the platform as well as participating as a seller on that platform), or the prices such companies can charge (as regulators often do for utilities or railways). These considerations would be 'size neutral': they would apply independently of corporate size per se.'</p><p>Capitalism has always had its plutocrats, but scaling back America's overly financialized model (by preventing stock buybacks, to cite one example) would represent a useful reform and prevent a lot of economic waste. Instead of going to enrich executives and shareholders beyond the dreams of Croesus, that measure might help to ensure that the profits of these companies will be directed to the workers' wages (which also means supporting increased unionization), or plowed back into investment (e.g., increased robotics).</p><p>Biodata, Privacy, and an End to Pandemic Profiteering</p><p>And there are fault lines in the business world. The pharmaceutical and medical research industries face immense pressure from other businesses to end the pandemic so they can get back to profitability. That means temporarily setting aside profits and pooling intellectual property to encourage collaborative efforts on the part of biotech and pharmaceutical companies to find proper treatments for COVID-19, and make them freely available, especially if governments were to waive antitrust scrutiny in exchange for all of the data Big Pharma companies collectively hold. As the Guardian reports, '[t]here is a precedent. Last June, 10 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies-including Johnson  and  Johnson, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline-announced they would pool data for an AI-based search for new antibiotics, which are urgently needed as antibiotic-resistant bacteria have proliferated across the world, threatening the growth of untreatable disease.'</p><p>Privacy advocates are already expressing concerns about a growing and overweening medical surveillance state. These surveillance concerns lack historical context: From the 19th century on, serious health problems were met by hardline government policies to reduce them. Policies ranging from quarantine to vaccine were not always mandatory, but there was an understanding that personal concessions had to be made to manage a huge population and an advanced society; the Constitution was not a suicide pact. We can further alleviate those concerns today by ensuring that the information uncovered does not become a precondition or additional cost of receiving insurance coverage. In light of coronavirus, cost savings of incorporating biodata into immigration and customs are a no-brainer for governments, and are certain to cause friction with individuals who may not want to give blood or saliva to get a visa or work permit, and agribusiness leaders who know that safety measures cut into profitability. But the scales have tipped in the other direction.</p><p>North Versus South</p><p>What about the other countries in the developing world that don't have close geographic proximity to a home market, or abundant supplies of key commodities required for 21st-century manufacturing needs, or even a well-developed manufacturing base (in other words, the countries that have hitherto been large recipients of investment solely on the grounds of cheap labor)? Many of them have faced immediate pressure with the collapse in global trade, unprecedented capital flight that is sure to grow as the coronavirus spreads, all the while coping with COVID-19 with highly inadequate health systems.</p><p>In the meantime, the multi-trillion-dollar market for emerging market debt, both sovereign bonds and commercial paper, has collapsed. Many of these countries, via their state pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, have become the ultimate endpoint for many of the newer asset-backed securities that finally revived years after the 2008 financial crisis. This has become the potential new stress point in the $52 trillion 'shadow banking' market. The U.S. Federal Reserve has sought to ease the funding stresses of much of the developing economies by offering central bank swap lines. It has also broadened prime dealer collateral acceptance rules, and set up commercial paper swap facilities, all of which have eased short-term funding pressures in these economies that have incurred substantial dollar liabilities.</p><p>As the emerging world central banks then start to lend on those lines to their own banks, it should start to alleviate the shortage of dollars in the offshore dollar funding markets. We are starting to see some easing of stresses, notably in Indonesia-because it's an exporter of resources more than a cheap labor price economy.</p><p>But whereas in previous emerging markets crises, China was able to buttress these economies via initiatives such as the 'Belt and Road Initiative,' Beijing itself is likely to be buffeted by the twin shocks of declining global trade and a reversal of foreign direct investment, which declined 8.6 percent in the first two months of this year.</p><p>Longer-term, many other countries face comparable challenges to China: Capital controls, collapsing domestic currencies, and widespread debt defaults are likely to become the norm. That's already happened to serial defaulter Argentina again. South Africa has been downgraded to junk status. Turkey remains vulnerable. The so-called 'BRICS' economies-Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa-are all sinking like bricks. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus and likely future pandemics will create additional stresses on developing economies that depend on their labor price advantage in the international marketplace to survive.</p><p>By contrast, countries like South Korea and Taiwan have had a 'good crisis.' Both have vibrant manufacturing sectors and created successful multiparty democracies. Foreign investment in South Korea continued to grow in the first quarter of this year, as it rapidly moved to contain the spread of COVID-19 through an extensive testing regime (while keeping its economy open). Similarly in Taiwan, by activating a national emergency response system launched in 2004 (following the SARS virus), that country has mounted a thoroughly competent coronavirus intervention of unprecedented effectiveness. The results speak for themselves: as of April 15, in South Korea, a mere 225 deaths, while in Taiwan, an astonishingly low total of six deaths in a country of 24 million people-this despite far more exposure to infected Chinese visitors than Italy, Spain or the U.S.</p><p>Of course, the very success of Taiwan's response revives another potential fault line, namely the tension underlying the 'One China' policy. Before COVID-19, it is noteworthy that the WHO 'even refused to publicly report Taiwan's cases of SARS until public pressure prompted numbers to be published under the label of 'Taiwan, province of China,'' according to Dr. Anish Koka. At the very least, Taiwan's divergent approach and success at fighting the pandemic will bolster its pro-independence factions.</p><p>The question of foreign nations upholding Taiwan's sovereignty with regard to China is increasingly thorny, given Beijing's growing military capacities. This will present an ongoing diplomatic challenge to Western parties who seek to increase engagement with Taipei without heightening tensions in the region.</p><p>A Recalculation of 'Economic Value'</p><p>We have outlined many fault lines likely to be exposed or exacerbated as a consequence of COVID-19. Happily, there is one fault line likely to be slammed shut: namely, the false dichotomy that has long existed between economic growth and environmentalism. The Global Assessment from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services reports that 'land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23 percent of the global land surface, up to US$577 billion in annual global crops are at risk from pollinator loss and 100-300 million people are at increased risk of floods and hurricanes because of loss of coastal habitats and protection.' Likewise, the study cites the fact that as of 2015, 33 percent of marine fish stocks 'were being harvested at unsustainable levels,' and notes the rise of plastic pollution (which 'has increased tenfold since 1980'), both of which play a key role in degrading ecosystems in a manner that ultimately destroys economic growth.</p><p>Finally, repeated pandemics over the past few decades have shown these are not blips, but recurrent features of today's world. Hence, there is an increasing public appetite for regulation to deal with this ongoing problem. Some industries, such as agribusinesses, won't like this, but the concerns are well-founded. According to expert Josh Balk, 75 percent of new diseases start in domestic and wild-caught animals, and 2.2 million people die each year from illnesses transferred from animals. The majority of these are transferred from poorly regulated factory farm chickens, cows and pigs; still, the 'wet markets' of Asia and Africa, and the trade in potential 'transfer species,' such as pangolins, a major driver of the $19 billion-a-year global trade in illegal wildlife, must also be addressed. Beijing has suggested it will ban trade in illegal wildlife and seek tighter regulation of the wet markets. The latter in particular may be easier said than done, according to Dr. Zhenzhong Si, a research associate at Canada's University of Waterloo who specializes in Chinese food security, sustainability, and rural development. Dr. Si argued that '[b]anning wet markets is not only going to be impossible, but will also be destructive for urban food security in China as they play such a pivotal role in ensuring urban residents' access to affordable and healthy food.'</p><p>To be fair, this isn't the first time that the sacred tenets of the global economic framework have dealt with a crisis that seemed to usher in a new era. The same thing happened in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. But that was largely seen as a financial crisis, a product of faulty global financial plumbing that nobody truly understood, as opposed to a widespread social collapse closely approximating the conditions of the Great Depression as we have today.</p><p>Not only has the current lockdown put the entire global economy into deep freeze, but it also came amidst a backdrop of widespread political and social upheaval, and a faux recovery whose fruits were largely restricted to the top tier. A collateralized debt obligation is not intuitively easy to grasp. By contrast, being forced to stay at home, deprived of vital income and isolated from loved ones, while health care workers perish from overwork and lack of protective gear, is a different order of magnitude.</p><p>Even as we re-integrate, it is hard to envisage a return to the 'old normal.' Trade patterns will change. Self-sufficiency and geographic proximity will be prioritized over global integration. There will be new winners and losers, but it is worth noting that the model of capitalism we are describing-one that does not feature obscenely overcompensated CEO pay co-existing with serf labor and the widespread offshoring of manufacturing-has existed in different forms in the U.S. from 1945 into the 1980s, and still exists in parts of Europe (Germany) and East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) to this day.</p><p>Our everyday lives will be impacted as selective quarantines and some forms of social distancing become the new normal (much as they were when we dealt with tuberculosis epidemics). All of this has implications for a multitude of industries: restaurants, leisure, travel, tourism, sporting events, entertainment, and media, as well as our evolving definition of 'essential' industries. Even our concept of personal privacy will likely have to be amended, especially in regard to medical matters. Concerns about medical surveillance-stigma (STDs, alcoholism, mental illness) and denial of insurance-can be alleviated if everyone is guaranteed treatment regardless of ability to pay, which will mean greater government intrusion into the lives of citizens and activities of businesses as the public sector seeks to socialize costs.</p><p>Taken in aggregate, we are about to experience the most profound social, economic and political changes since World War II.</p><p>Author Bios:</p><p>Marshall Auerback is a market analyst and commentator.</p><p>Jan Ritch-Frel is the executive director of the Independent Media Institute.</p><p>Source: Independent Media Institute</p><p>Credit Line: This article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLGUAR-SRILAGUARD1704202000003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLGUAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y31-JCH9-G4MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sri Lanka Guardian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sri Lanka Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18517\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Medical Examinations</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUM0M0U2MkVDRkUxNDQ4MDlDNUVBMkYyMjBEODhEMTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000624</classCode><className>ENTERPRISE GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Banks see creating ecosystems and partnerships with big tech as a natural fit and key to their long-term strategy.

Banks are very much in product silos and wedded to legacy technology, especially on the back end. By partnering with big tech companies and leveraging new technologies, they can deliver a better customer experience. The more financial services institutions create platforms, the more they will break out of their silos. Much like Amazon does, banks will use their brand to be customer-facing, and then create platforms and eco-systems of augmented services that utilize their platform and enable them to also contribute to revenue. Big Tech will white-label financial services to expand. Amazon created a business of third party providers that leverage Amazon's scale and technology platform of analytics and data to broaden their reach and serve a broader eco-system under the Amazon brand. Amazon scaled by leveraging three things: User Experience, Data, and Technology. Instead of focusing on growth in adjacencies, Amazon grew by customer demand management and having a scalable platform which allowed them to bolt-on product and services which the customers demanded. These three foundational elements of the banking platform, User Experience, Data, and Technology, are all key to ensure that efforts to develop such an eco-system in financial services are sustainable.A Partnership Between Big Tech And BanksBanks like Goldman have realized it's smarter, and more cost-effective in terms of customer acquisition[4] costs, to partner and leverage a customer platform like Amazon or Apple to sell financial services that their end clients will need like loans, credit cards, and financial advice. It's unsurprising to see a forward-thinking bank like Goldman betting big on #8216;banking as a service#8217; business strategy. These firms believe they can offer the best behind the scenes solution to many non-financial companies as they start offering financial services directly to their clients. Additionally appealing to Goldman, is the ability to can co-mingle its data, AI[5], and liquidity with a big tech platform like Amazon to drive scale and personalization for end users. Another example is where banks can partner with a travel agency so the agency becomes part of the bank's platform. This allows the bank to become more than a transaction facilitator and to have a personal interaction with the client when they are booking a trip. Enabling banks to win in an open platform economy includes big data, APIs and business model inventions, organization reengineering and marketing automation. Banks need to get out of their swim lane, whether through open banking (a European phenomenon enabled by APIs) or through bringing other types of partnerships and experiences to the eco-system. Investing in ecosystem dynamics enables banks to play in the non-banking industry. A platform approach can enable new value and revenue streams through partnerships, and opening up the bank's capabilities, driving real transformation.About Publicis Sapient: Publicis Sapient is a digital transformation partner helping established organizations get to their future, digitally-enabled states, both in the way they work and the way they serve their customers.

It will target tech giants like Google and Facebook and health insurers Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Anthem while making sure Federal Trade Commission regulators are doing their job.The Dems' new push will focus on three areas: consolidation of health care markets driving up prices for consumers, the monopolization of big tech platforms and anti-competitive labor abuses like non-compete agreements and wage fixing. Hearings on these issues could even result in the first major rewrite of antitrust law since the 1950s.This will be a major shift in policy in an area of vital economic importance for the country. Corporate consolidation has occurred across almost every industry in the United States[1] over the past 40 years, from airlines[2] to tech[3] to weapons manufacturers[4] to beer[5] to pharmaceuticals[6] to, yes, even ski lodges[7]. The result has been radically increased economic and political inequality writ large in society that is constraining the economy[8].Democrats increasingly see antitrust policy in the same vein that they have come to view campaign finance reform \u2015 a fundamental structural problem underlying the many issues of skyrocketing health care costs, lower wages, lack of labor mobility, rising prices, fewer local businesses and less political power. </p><p>A 2018 poll by the anti-monopoly group Open Markets Institute[9]found 76 percent of respondents believed 'big corporations have too much power over your family and your community.''There's been a growing recognition that many of the central concerns of the Democratic Party, namely on inequality and regional inequality, are being driven by concentration and a lack of antitrust enforcement,' Zach Freed, a researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-monopoly nonprofit, said.Leading the charge on antitrust for Democrats is Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) who will take the helm of the antitrust subcommittee within the House Judiciary Committee in January.Cicilline has emerged as an aggressive voice calling for a break with the antitrust status quo that has turned a blind eye to the extreme consolidation across the economy. He helped launch a congressional antitrust caucus and is the lead sponsor of key antitrust reform bills that range from giving the news media more power to organize against digital ad monopolies like Google and Facebook to modernizing the antitrust laws passed during the age of Teddy Roosevelt.He intends to host hearings to build a record and obtain analysis from experts and to craft legislation to rein in consolidation and anti-competitive behavior in health care markets, the big tech platforms and labor contracts. He will also plan aggressive oversight of the Federal Trade Commission, the main antitrust regulator that has enabled extreme corporate consolidation over the past 40 years thanks to the adoption of pro-monopoly economic theories[10] by lawyers and economists of both political parties.Proponents of aggressive antitrust enforcement are excited about Cicilline's rise to the chairman's seat on the antitrust panel.'They've been doing a great job of elevating the issue of antitrust \u2015 scrutinizing the enforcement of the oversight agency for the first time in a long time,' Marshall Steinbaum, fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, said about Cicilline and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.'It's gonna be great,' Matt Stoller, fellow at Open Markets Institute, said. 'Man, we're going to kick some ass.'Cicilline may be a lawyer, but he didn't come to Congress with expertise in antitrust. After he became ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee,he noticed how the consolidation problems that he was investigating in his oversight role overlapped with the broader inequality issues that Democrats were trying to tackle.'As I began to do this work I really came to realize that this fundamental question of, 'How do we get the economy working again for everyone in this country so that working people have a fighting chance to get ahead?' is really connected to this very serious concentration of economic power, and concentration of political power, and it's getting worse rather than getting better,' Cicilline said.Cicilline was one of a number of members who pushed for the inclusion of strong antitrust principles in the Democratic Party's midterm policy platform. That 'Better Deal' platform[11] included very strong language calling for a new antitrust consensus and a focus on breaking up consolidated markets and giving workers more power and more pay.Although the Democrats' Better Deal policy program mentioned consolidation in markets from oil and gas to eyeglasses, it notably left out the problem of big tech monopolies. Cicilline, however, is one of Silicon Valley's biggest critics on Capitol Hill. He told Facebook that it 'cannot be trusted to regulate itself' and got Google CEO Sundar Pichai to admit that Google was considering launching a search engine in China.He intends on hosting more hearings with tech CEOs and technologists who analyze competition on digital platforms to develop a better understanding of how these tech trusts dominate markets and crush competition. This will result in legislation that could enable users to port their data from one social platform to another or mandate the platforms become interoperable with each other and future competitors.Congressional Democrats are supportive of this push for more antitrust oversight. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told antitrust regulators at an oversight hearing in December that Congress had abdicated its role for too long by allowing 'pro-big business administrations,' both Republican and Democratic, to erode antitrust laws.'The decline in enforcement over the last several decades has also been an economic catastrophe for millions of workers,' Nadler said.There is even interest in stronger antitrust oversight from Republicans on the Judiciary committee. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the next ranking member on the committee, has taken umbrage at consolidation in the pharmacy benefit manager market. He introduced legislation to shine a light on the anti-competitive practices in the industry to uncover how they are driving up consumer costs for drugs.But where the Republican leadership was not interested in prioritizing these issues in the last Congress, the Democratic Party leadership is insistent on pursuing them.'What has been really remarkable is there has been a really significant kind of renewal of interest in antitrust in the Congress,' Cicilline observes. 'I think there is sort of a reawakening of the kind of understanding the critical impact that competition and antitrust enforcement has in getting the economy to work right.'

In fact, you actually paid extra to stand on stage with your favourite band, singing along to the words in front of the euphoric crowd. But wait: there s a problem. You haven t organised dinner yet. So, you remove your virtual reality headset, before asking your voice assistant to order groceries for this evening. Delivery robots make life much easier these days. For now, you re content to re-immerse yourself in the festival   safely tucked away in the backseat of your driverless car.</p><p>Such a scenario might sound implausible, but some of the technologies enabling these experiences already exist. This is epitomised by the investments of the SoftBank Vision Fund, launched last year, which aims to  enable the next age of innovation and make tomorrow s world possible . The fund has backed trends including artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles   exemplified by its investment in Brain Corp, a producer of self-driving technology for robots. The Japanese bank s portfolio is enormous, having secured $93bn (\u00a371bn) in commitments at last count out of a planned $100bn. And major institutions including the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and Apple (US: AAPL) are investors; naturally, this inspires greater confidence in the enterprises it endorses.</p><p>The Vision Fund is fuelled entirely by private capital, but it provides a useful overview of promising sectors. When it comes to new technologies, opportunities should by no means surpass the reach of retail investors. While many of the most talked-about public technology stocks are based in the US and Asia-Pacific regions, these companies are increasingly acquiring or collaborating with foreign businesses to bolster their competitive advantage. And, as this article will explore, there are various entry-points into these technologies here in the UK.</p><p>Key to the expansion of recent technologies is the scale of  big data  available today, and the advancement of computer processing power. High-tech and everyday products are now more connected than ever before, collectively representing the  Internet of things : a world in which data is continuously shared across our devices. This has both driven and been enhanced by the rise of AI, robotics and virtual reality (VR) among other technologies; the applications of which transcend the entertainment market, serving sectors as varied as healthcare and defence.</p><p>It is, of course, vital to remember that technology companies in their emergent stages can carry inherent risks. One need only revisit the bursting of the dot-com bubble at the start of this century to see how tech stocks with sky-high valuations can come crashing down when the veil of potential is lifted. But it can still prove worthwhile to make judicious calls on nascent trends, in the context of a diversified, balanced portfolio. The smartphone offers a clich\u00e9d but relevant example of a disruptive product that is now intrinsic to everyday life.</p><p>1. Artificial intelligence</p><p>Albert Einstein was perhaps prophetic when he said:  It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity . This was demonstrated famously in March 2016, when AlphaGo   a program conceived by AI specialist DeepMind   successfully beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol at the Chinese board game  Go . To buy into DeepMind, look no further than Alphabet (US:GOOGL), which acquired the UK business in January 2014 for \u00a3400m. These days, among various projects, DeepMind works with the NHS to improve diagnostics and time to treatment. Its  Streams  app, used by the Royal Free Hospital in London, sends mobile updates to doctors about their patients  conditions.</p><p>AI is synonymous with quality control, efficiency and workplace optimisation, and we expect to see a rising number of investable stocks in this space, across many industries. In their report, Artificial Intelligence: the next digital frontier?, analysts at the McKinsey Global Institute estimate that tech giants around the world spent $20bn-$30bn on AI in 2016 alone.</p><p>With rising interest in investment opportunities, it perhaps is no surprise that Smith &amp; Williamson launched an artificial intelligence fund in July this year. The UK asset manager even uses a proprietary AI tool to help select equities for inclusion. Meanwhile, Aim-traded Polar Capital (POLR) announced its own Automation and Artificial Intelligence Fund on 9 October. At the time, technology director Ben Rogoff said  intelligent machines will require a rewriting of fundamental design and manufacturing principles  which  could prove as significant as the introduction of just-in time (JIT) inventory management and the reinvention of logistics in the 1980s .</p><p>Machine translation</p><p>In a recent report, The State of AI 2017, Numis and MMC Ventures note the difference between machine learning and  deep learning . The former entails programmes learning through training, rather than being programmed by rules. Meanwhile, deep learning is  a subset of machine learning that is delivering breakthrough results in fields including computer vision and language . Like an animal s brain,  networks of artificial neurons process input data to extract features and optimise variables relevant to a problem, with results improving through training .</p><p>One of the more common uses of AI is language translation, enabled by machine learning. Again, Google is a leader here: its translate service knows more than 100 languages. And, last November, the company announced the launch of a  neural machine translation  service whereby whole sentences are translated in one go, bringing greater accuracy. In the UK, language technology specialist SDL (SDL) is also exploring the power of machines. The first half of 2017 saw lower usage of machine translation for Asian languages because of their relative complexity, but SDL s management told us that progress was now being made with Japanese. The launch of their own neural translation solution bolsters the group s offering.</p><p>Algorithmic advertising</p><p>More generally, AI can help businesses to understand their customers, and thus provide targeted content. Mobile advertising specialist Taptica (TAP) uses machine learning to monitor changing behaviour and trends, before marketing particular products and services. Meanwhile, media companies such as Netflix (US:NFLX) use AI to gauge viewers  preferences, before recommending new programmes. Spotify and other music streaming services have similar techniques, proposing playlists based on the songs that a person has already listened to. In fact, Spotify acquired an AI start-up, Niland, in May this year, noting that the business  shares Spotify s passion for surfacing the right content to the right user at the right time . We recently noted the media speculation that Spotify might undergo a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. This would put it in direct competition with other US-listed companies that have music streaming services enhanced by AI, including Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US: MZN) and Pandora (US:P).</p><p>Good morning, Moneypenny Siri</p><p>Without doubt, translation tools are useful, and personalised streaming services have transformed the way we consume TV and music. But the notion of mechanical employees had always seemed clinical, and ultimately too futuristic to become a reality. Enter voice assistants. Built into so-called home listening devices, these rely on speech recognition. The Amazon Echo is one variety, humanised by the personality  Alexa . Users can ask questions, play music and even add items to their online shopping baskets. Meanwhile, Apple s HomePod, embodied by the company s Siri assistant, is due to be released later this year. And, although it has a somewhat less catchy title (LF-S50G), Tokyo-listed Sony has a speaker lined up that uses Google assistant. These simulated voices enable greater connectivity across their parent companies  ubiquitous hardware devices, encouraging customers to remain loyal to the brand in question while playing a central role in the internet of things.</p><p>The potential applications of AI are almost infinite. There are, of course, ethical and security issues   the sharing of personal information required to enable artificial learning, and the privacy threats stemming from having all-seeing, all-hearing products in one s home. Not to mention the recent innovations in biometric passwords, whereby machines can identify a person through voice or facial recognition. But as computers continue to advance, we expect to see many more companies benefiting from the data capacity, memory and customisation that AI can bring, unimpeded by the limitations of the human brain.</p><p>2. ROBOTS AND AUTOMATION</p><p>Robotics and automation are underpinned by AI, but they have carved out a significant market of their own across multiple sectors. And their presence is only predicted to grow.</p><p>With automation come efficiencies and cost savings, arguably representing a partial antidote to the  productivity puzzle  troubling the UK in recent years. The Bank of England s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said in March this year:  Productivity growth has consistently underperformed relative to expectations since at least the global financial crisis.  And  with each year that passes, and as each new turning point in productivity has failed to materialise, this mystery has deepened . While the broader productivity puzzle refers to the stagnation of the UK economy, it seems fair to theorise that the robotic processes assisting UK companies might ultimately help the economy.</p><p>Through the prism of potential</p><p>As with most technologies, there are two sets of beneficiaries when it comes to investing in robotics and automation: those providing the solutions, and those interweaving these solutions into their working practices. Blue Prism (PRSM) falls into the former category. It provides, in its own words,  robotic process automation  via a digital workforce of software robots. Its software is used by organisations around the world to carry out rules-based, back-office tasks that can take up employees  time. Shareholders appear to be convinced of its bright prospects. When the company floated on Aim in March 2016, it placed 27m shares at 78p each; today, the shares are worth 1,208p. And revenues were up a whopping 133 per cent for the six months ending 30 April 2017. But the shares are trading at a significant premium, particularly for a business with a relatively short public history.</p><p>Ideagen (IDEA), meanwhile, provides governance, risk and compliance (GRC) software to highly regulated industries, and among its offerings sits Pentana, a leading audit automation product. This is designed to save auditors thousands of hours every year, provide more accurate audit reports and a higher level of control. Analysts at research business Gartner say the GRC market was worth $4.4bn in 2016, and is growing by around 13 per cent every year. We imagine this growth will also mean rising demand for automation.</p><p>Alfa Financial Software (ALFA) provides  automated processing using business rules  to the asset finance industry via its main product, Alfa Systems. Its IPO in June this year was the biggest UK technology listing since 2015. The company's recent maiden half-year results impressed with 57 per cent revenue growth, although its forward earnings multiple remains exceptionally high   a commonplace issue among popular tech stocks.</p><p>Automated warehouses</p><p>Out of the office, online retailers are also benefiting from robotics and automation. Along with Amazon, UK-listed businesses ASOS (ASC) and Boohoo (BOO) have been vocal about automating their warehouses. Boohoo raised \u00a350m via a share placing in June this year to fund an automated  super-site  of around 600,000 sq ft, aiming to achieve more than \u00a32bn of net sales capacity. At the time, management said this would cost approximately \u00a3150m in total over three years. Meanwhile, Ocado (OCDO) uses automated grocery fulfilment centres. That said, it is currently the third-most shorted stock in the UK, according to ShortTracker, and an IC sell tip; the company s technological edge doesn t seem to have helped its investment case yet.</p><p>Robo doc</p><p>Given their hallmarks of precision and excellence, it is unsurprising that robots have entered the healthcare sector. In the US, Nasdaq-listed Intuitive Surgical (US:ISRG) is the leader in robotic-assisted surgery. Its da Vinci Surgical System allows doctors to operate on patients with minimal invasion, making small incisions and then using a magnified 3D high-definition system, with small instruments that are more flexible than a surgeon s hands. In the second quarter of 2017, global da Vinci procedures grew by around 16 per cent year on year, while a new model was launched (the Da Vinci X) to provide surgeons with robotic assistance at a lower price.</p><p>Among other companies specialising in robotic surgery, PricewaterhouseCoopers   What doctor?  report names Verb Surgical, which is working with Johnson &amp; Johnson s Ethicon and Alphabet s Verily to develop surgical robots. Hansen Medical develops and sells medical robotics to operate catheters, and Nasdaq-quoted Mazor Robotics (US: MZOR) uses surgical guidance systems to perform spine and brain surgery.</p><p>Broad-brush approach</p><p>ETFs including the iShares Automation and Robotics UCITS (RBTX) and the Robo Global Robotics and Automation UCITS (ROBG) offer concentrated exposure to companies engaging with robotics and automation. That said, when it comes to funds, a more specific approach can of course increase the level of risk being taken. Caution is key: the ETF following the Robo Global index, like some of the themes it incorporates, is a recent phenomenon   it only listed in 2014.</p><p>3. DRIVERLESS CARS</p><p>Autonomous vehicles: another technological advancement enabled by AI, and an area that has attracted heightened press attention in recent months as competition intensifies between the major developers. The aforementioned SoftBank Vision Fund led a $164m financing round on 10 October in Mapbox, a mapping company whose  Drive  platform uses sensor data to enable semi- and fully-autonomous driving.</p><p>The key market players</p><p>Among the most talked-about public businesses is Tesla (US:TSLA), the brainchild of entrepreneur Elon Musk, and arguably the most ambitious of its peers. All Tesla vehicles produced from the Tesla factory include the hardware to enable full self-driving capabilities. But while management sought to produce above 1,500 of the Model 3 cars in September alone, just 260 were produced in the whole of the third quarter of 2017. It may take longer than expected to reach mass production.</p><p>Naturally, Apple, as with most technologies, is also involved in this space: in June, chief executive Tim Cook told Bloomberg that the group is  focusing on autonomous systems . And Alphabet entered the arena via its Waymo business. The FT recently reported that due to a clerical error, a court filing revealed just how much Alphabet had invested into its self-driving programme between 2009 and 2015   a whopping $1.1bn. Meanwhile, private enterprise Uber has been vocal about creating autonomous taxi fleets. But it is currently in the midst of a lawsuit with Alphabet over allegations that it stole trade secrets after its acquisition of Otto   a self-driving trucking business founded by a former Waymo employee, Anthony Levandowski. Like the other major players in the area, Uber has been testing its self-driving software in vehicles   but the potential loss of the company s London licence may distract, slowing the pace of the company s progress. That said, earlier this month Uber said in a statement that its board has approved a proposed investment from SoftBank (this deal has not yet been finalised).</p><p>Driving in convoy</p><p>Self-driving pioneers aren t just innovating from within; they are also collaborating and acquiring to get a foot in the door of the driverless garage. Chinese tech giant Tencent announced last month that it was joining forces with Guangzhou Automobile Group to produce connected cars and AI-aided driving. It has already bought a 5 per cent stake in Tesla this year for $1.78bn. General Motors (US:GM) acquired automation specialist Cruise in 2016 for $1bn. Intel completed its $15bn acquisition of Mobileye in August. Meanwhile, Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have formed the  Alliance 2022  group, focusing on electric cars and aiming to launch a fleet of driverless vehicles by 2022. Together, the alliance forms the world s largest car manufacturer.</p><p>There are currently no UK-listed companies in the running to come out on top of the global driverless car race. But investors can look at other sectors preparing for a driver-free future. Manufacturers will need software, which in turn requires top-notch cyber security features. In fact, the UK government recently published some key principles of cyber security for connected and automated vehicles. Cyber security is a highly competitive marketplace, and the fastest-growing area of the IT industry. It is likely to become more so as technology is charged with protecting people s lives.</p><p>4. 3D PRINTING</p><p>It feels as though '3D printing' only entered our vocabularies in recent years. In fact, the technology originated more than two decades ago. Chuck Hull, the founder of US specialist 3D Systems (US:DDD), created the first ever 3D printed part in 1983. At the time, this was known as stereolithography. Fast forward to the present day, and the process is rapidly gaining recognition, as industry experts realise just how much change it could bring to several sectors. So what is 3D printing? In a nutshell, it is also known as additive manufacturing, and it entails objects being built, layer by layer, within a printing device. The materials used depend on the end product. And while it is still an emerging technology, analysts at Boston Consulting Group say that in 2015, the entire 3D printing market was worth $5bn; they expect this to triple by 2020.</p><p>A significant impact on global trade</p><p>With greater use of 3D printing will come major, tangible consequences   or repercussions   for global trade relationships. In a recent report, ING found that   based on estimates   3D printing could lead to almost 25 per cent of international trade being wiped out by the year 2060, as local manufacturing supersedes the need to import goods. The main industries affected would include industrial machinery, consumer products and automotive. And, in terms of carmakers, the relationships most affected would be those between the US and its leading import partners: Mexico, Japan, Germany and Canada. So, while this hypothesis looks a long way into the future, it is worth contemplating how manufacturers might cope with shifting demand.</p><p>3D printing has not yet reached the point of global mass production. Even so, sales are still growing (if marginally) for 3D Systems, with second-quarter revenues up 1 per cent year on year at $159.5m. Its peer in the US, Stratasys (US:SSYS) serves a similar range of industries, including aerospace, healthcare, dentistry and education, to name a few.</p><p>High-speed sintering: the path to mass production</p><p>3D printing isn t just confined to the other side of the pond. Xaar (XAR), an Aim-listed inkjet technology specialist, says that mass production is now a reality thanks to high-speed sintering (bear with us). They note that this improves users  time to market and return on investment. Essentially, a fine layer of powder is deposited onto the surface of a powder bed; then, an inkjet printhead prints an infrared absorbing fluid onto this surface. Infrared energy then melts (or  sinters ) only the printed sections. This process is repeated layer by layer to build the intended item. Notably, while revenues and profits were down slightly in Xaar s latest half-year results, its 3D and advanced manufacturing divisions grew by 200 per cent year on year.</p><p>Xaar s resident  HSS  expert, Professor Neil Hopkinson explains, that in the short term, aerospace and sports and leisure will gain the most from this technique, while the automotive industry will be a longer-term beneficiary, with advantages including lighter car parts. Structured heels on running shoes are just one example of how 3D printing might benefit ordinary people as well as industrial consumers.</p><p>&lt;a sideclass=\"boxout&lt;headerclass=\"boxout__header&lt;h2class=\"boxout__title&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div class=\"boxout__content &lt;headline&gt;The various uses of 3D printing&lt;headline&gt;</p><p>Earlier this year, start-up Apis Cor successfully built a tiny house using a mobile 3D printer in Moscow. This took 24 hours.</p><p>L Oreal announced in 2015 that it was working on 3D printed skin, to enable safe testing of products. Then, in 2016, the group launched a partnership with Poietis to develop 3D bioprinting of hair follicles.</p><p>The Guardian recently reported that Joint Mitnor, an ancient cave in Devon, now contains various 3D printed fossils. The Pengelly Trust, the Natural History Museum and the University of Birmingham collaborated to produce these, after several artefacts were stolen a couple of years ago. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;</p><p>5. VIRTUAL REALITY</p><p>In 1999, The Matrix became a global blockbuster film. Its storyline in brief: a group of characters interacts within a simulated reality, projected by machines. At the time, this was utterly futuristic   proved more so by the fact that viewers were forced to attend their local cinema or rent the video, watching a two-dimensional screen in either scenario. This was before the advent of 3D movies, before innovation changed the way we consume TV and, of course, before virtual reality became a true possibility.</p><p>VR in numbers</p><p>VR entails the creation of an immersive, completely digital environment using specialised hardware and tailored content. And after years of almost coming to fruition, the VR market finally seems to be taking off. Zeus Capital says that over the past four years more than $15bn has been invested in developing VR technology. And investment of another $50bn is expected between now and 2025. Companies of all sizes are striving to engage with this burgeoning trend, although the major hardware developers are those you might expect: Facebook and Google, to name a couple. According to PwC s 'Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2017-21', there will be 275m VR headsets in the market by 2021 across 10 markets. Correspondingly, global VR revenues will reach $15bn in four years  time, up from $869m in 2016.</p><p>Hardware or content?</p><p>What are the investment opportunities in VR? In terms of headsets, look to the US and Asia, where most of the big tech giants have created devices. Harold Evans at FinnCap points out that the  barriers to entry are enormous on the hardware side . The pricing of these products will be key to the market s success. Facebook (US:FB) bought Oculus, the producer of the Rift VR headset, back in 2014 and has already cut its price twice in the past year   seemingly to make it more accessible. This month, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced plans for Oculus Go, a cheaper mobile headset to be released next year. More varieties include Sony s Playstation VR device and HTC s Vive headset.</p><p>Here in the UK, there are several listed companies generating VR content. Earlier this year, SoftBank led a $500m funding round for Improbable, the private British business using virtual reality to create simulated worlds; this may ultimately become another Vision Fund constituent. Importantly for those concerned by overseas tech giants swallowing up British talent, this investment gave SoftBank a non-controlling stake in the start-up.</p><p>Gaming is traditionally the most obvious use for VR and Aim-quoted Frontier Developments (FDEV) has launched a VR-specific version of its popular game Elite Dangerous. Mercia Technologies (MERC) also has exposure to virtual reality gaming content via its investment in nDreams. Those that work with gaming companies   for example, Keywords Studios (KWS), a provider of digital game services   should also benefit from rising interest in VR content. Keywords  offering includes localisation services   translating video games and voice-overs   and player support.</p><p>Musical headsets</p><p>Outside of gaming, EVR Holdings (EVRH) creates virtual reality music content. This provides an alternative to physically attending concerts, instead allowing people to watch from home while wearing a VR headset. Since its Aim IPO in May last year, EVR has announced agreements with hardware developers, rights holders and major music labels. But here s the thing: the company s flagship product, MelodyVR, hasn t launched yet. EVR has no revenues and no official forecasts; the more than 150 per cent rise in share price over the past 12 months can be attributed to newsflow and optimism alone. Zeus, EVR s broker, says that in its base case scenario, MelodyVR s gross revenues could be approximately $650m in 2021, while the bull case scenario says $1bn. But it is difficult for them to make firm predictions, given the company s early stage. Chief executive Anthony Matchett is waiting until there are around 25-30m VR headsets in the market before the app goes live, which might occur by Christmas or in early 2018. For now, the company s reliance on a buoyant hardware market makes it an interesting, if highly speculative bet.</p><p>Virtual education</p><p>Beyond entertainment, VR also facilitates instruction and education. As part of its offering, Pennant (PNT), the small-cap defence training and software specialist, uses VR for defence training exercises. Products include a virtual parachute training simulator. Participants remain in a safe environment and there is no need to take equipment out of service. Meanwhile, Learning Technologies (LTG) demonstrates how educational experiences can be enhanced with VR: its Preloaded division is working with the Tate Modern to create an immersive Modigliani exhibition. FinnCap s Mr Evans notes that education could be an area of significant potential for VR, as could augmented reality, for that matter; particularly if content providers were to win contracts with schools.</p><p>6. AUGMENTED REALITY</p><p>Augmented reality (AR) entails digital objects being overlaid onto real-life surroundings. And headsets aren t always required; AR can be experienced through smartphones alone.</p><p>Snap (SNAP), which listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2016, is among the best-known applications to have bridged the gap here between  techies  and normal consumers. Anyone with the Snapchat app on their phones can apply digital filters to their faces (such as dog ears or a floral headdress). But the company has had a tough few months. Over the past few weeks, the shares have continually traded below the IPO price of $17, and have endured target downgrades from banks including Morgan Stanley, which led the IPO. That said, management is exploring new ways of monetising the platform   its '3D world lenses', for example, allow businesses to advertise their products on people s screens.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, launched its ARKit platform for app developers seeking a route into the AR market. The product works with iPhones and iPads   keeping clients within the Apple family. While AR offers a different experiential medium from VR, there are also other types of multi-sensory technology. IP Group (IPO), which is in the midst of trying to acquire Touchstone Innovations (IVO), has invested in Ultrahaptics, a company using ultrasound technology to give the sensation of touch.</p><p>First movers: the winners?</p><p>These are all promising technologies, although they are still very much in the developmental, and thus high-risk, stages. People and companies increasingly expect ultra-connectivity between, and greater immersion in, their products and services. As such features become prerequisites of modern life, we imagine these technologies will garner more air-time in the investment world. Adding clout to this argument, audit and consulting house PwC identifies these same themes, among others, in its 'Tech Breakthrough Megatrends' report.</p><p>It is difficult to say which businesses will succeed: the first movers within each technology may act as pace-setters, rather than the ultimate winners. It is possible that the UK businesses innovating in these areas will be acquired by bigger, wealthier tech companies from overseas. The uncertainty for UK business after the Brexit vote can partly be blamed for a recent proliferation in such activity (see SoftBank and ARM Holdings, or indeed Chinese company Canyon Bridge and Imagination Technologies (IMG). But takeovers aren t necessarily a bad thing: we ve seen what a premium the behemoths are willing to pay. And, with such innovation being displayed by listed UK tech companies, they may well make it on their own, or indeed become acquirers themselves.</p><p>With business people like Elon Musk at the helm, we will undoubtedly be discussing trends again in 10 years  time that were once deemed highly improbable. For example, Mr Musk s recently announced plans for intercity space rocket transportation. Given the meaning behind Mr Musk s infamous acronym  BFR , we should also perhaps anticipate relaxed censorship of corporate language.</p><p>Buy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PSP-63F1-DYX2-S48Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><issn>0261-3115</issn><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 20, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Shoshana Zuboff. PublicAffairs, 2019. 704pp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his 1944 classic, The Great Transformation, the economic historian Karl Polanyi told the story of modern capitalism as a \"double movement\" that led to both the expansion of the market and its restriction. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, old feudal restraints on commerce were abolished, and land, labor, and money came to be treated as commodities. But unrestrained capitalism ravaged the environment, damaged public health, and led to economic panics and depressions, and by the time Polanyi was writing, societies had reintroduced limits on the market.</p><p>Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at the Harvard Business School, sees a new version of the first half of Polanyi's double movement at work today with the rise of \"surveillance capitalism,\" a new market form pioneered by Facebook and Google. In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, she argues that capitalism is once again extending the sphere of the market, this time by claiming \"human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales.\" With the rise of \"ubiquitous computing\" (the spread of computers into all realms of life) and the Internet of Things (the connection of everyday objects to the Internet), the extraction of data has become <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-04-03/rise-big-data\">pervasive</url>. We live in a world increasingly populated with networked devices that capture our communications, movements, behavior, and relationships, even our emotions and states of mind. And, Zuboff warns, surveillance capitalism has thus far escaped the sort of countermovement described by Polanyi.\u00a0</p><p>Zuboff's book is a brilliant, arresting analysis of the digital economy and a plea for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-06-01/why-internet-access-human-right\">social awakening</url> about the enormity of the changes that technology is imposing on political and social life. Most Americans see the threats posed by technology companies as matters of privacy. But Zuboff shows that surveillance capitalism involves more than the accumulation of personal data on an unprecedented scale. The technology firms and their experts-whom Zuboff labels \"the new priesthood\"-are creating new forms of power and means of behavioral modification that operate outside individual awareness and public accountability. Checking this priesthood's power will require a new countermovement-one that restrains surveillance capitalism in the name of personal freedom and democracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE RISE OF THE MACHINES</emphasis></p><p>A reaction against the power of the technology industry is already underway. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting antitrust investigations of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. In July, the FTC levied a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ftc-fine-five-billion/\">$5 billion fine</url> on Facebook for violating promises to consumers that the company made in its own privacy policies (the United States, unlike the European Union, has no general law protecting online privacy). Congress is considering legislation to limit technology companies' use of data and roll back the broad immunity from liability for user-generated content that it granted them in the Communications Decency Act of 1996. This national debate, still uncertain in its ultimate impact, makes Zuboff's book all the more timely and relevant.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism also has an international dimension. U.S. companies have long dominated the technology industry and the Internet, arousing suspicion and opposition in other countries. Now, chastened by the experience of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Americans are getting nervous about stores of personal data falling into the hands of hostile foreign powers. In July of this year, there was a viral panic about FaceApp, a mobile application for editing pictures of faces that millions of Americans had downloaded to see projected images of themselves at older ages. Created by a Russian firm, the app was rumored to be used by Russian intelligence to gather facial recognition data, perhaps to create deepfake videos-rumors that the firm has denied. Early last year, a Chinese company's acquisition of the gay dating app Grindr stirred concern about the potential use of the app's data to compromise individuals and U.S. national security; the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has since ordered the Chinese firm to avoid accessing Grindr's data and divest itself entirely of Grindr by June 2020. It is not hard to imagine how the rivalry between the United States and China could lead not only to a technology divorce but also to two different worlds of everyday surveillance.</p><p>According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism originated with the brilliant discoveries and brazen claims of one American firm. \"Google,\" she writes, \"is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.\" Incorporated in 1998, Google soon came to dominate Internet search. But initially, it did not focus on advertising and had no clear path to profitability. What it did have was a groundbreaking insight: the collateral data it derived from searches-the numbers and patterns of queries, their phrasing, people's click patterns, and so on-could be used to improve Google's search results and add new services for users. This would attract more users, which would in turn further improve its search engine in a recursive cycle of learning and expansion.</p><p>Google's commercial breakthrough came in 2002, when it saw that it could also use the collateral data it collected to profile the users themselves according to their characteristics and interests. Then, instead of matching ads with search queries, the company could match ads with individual users. Targeting ads precisely and efficiently to individuals is the Holy Grail of advertising. Rather than being Google's customers, Zuboff argues, the users became its raw-material suppliers, from whom the firm derived what she calls \"behavioral surplus.\" That surplus consists of the data above and beyond what Google needs to improve user services. Together with the company's formidable capabilities in artificial intelligence, Google's enormous flows of data enabled it to create what Zuboff sees as the true basis of the surveillance industry-\"prediction products,\" which anticipate what users will do \"now, soon, and later.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-05-25/violence-algorithms\">Predicting</url> what people will buy is the key to advertising, but behavioral predictions have obvious value for other purposes, as well, such as insurance, hiring decisions, and political campaigns.\u00a0</p><p>Zuboff's analysis helps make sense of the seemingly unrelated services offered by Google, its diverse ventures and many acquisitions. Gmail, Google Maps, the Android operating system, YouTube, Google Home, even self-driving cars-these and dozens of other services are all ways, Zuboff argues, of expanding the company's \"supply routes\" for user data both on- and offline. Asking for permission to obtain those data has not been part of the company's operating style. For instance, when the company was developing Street View, a feature of its mapping service that displays photographs of different locations, it went ahead and recorded images of streets and homes in different countries without first asking for local permission, fighting off opposition as it arose. In the surveillance business, any undefended area of social life is fair game.\u00a0</p><p>This pattern of expansion reflects an underlying logic of the industry: in the competition for artificial intelligence and surveillance revenues, the advantage goes to the firms that can acquire both vast and varied streams of data. The other companies engaged in surveillance capitalism at the highest level-Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and the big telecommunications companies-also face the same <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-08-13/big-choice-big-tech\">expansionary imperatives</url>. Step by step, the industry has expanded both the scope of surveillance (by migrating from the virtual into the real world) and the depth of surveillance (by plumbing the interiors of individuals' lives and accumulating data on their personalities, moods, and emotions).</p><p>The surveillance industry has not faced much resistance because users like its personalized information and free products. Indeed, they like them so much that they readily agree to onerous, one-sided terms of service. When the FaceApp controversy blew up, many people who had used the app were surprised to learn that they had agreed to give the company \"a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed, without compensation to you.\" But this wasn't some devious Russian formulation. As Wired pointed out, Facebook has just as onerous terms of service.\u00a0</p><p>Even if Congress enacts legislation barring companies from imposing such extreme terms, it is unlikely to resolve the problems Zuboff raises. Most people are probably <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-08-18/data-minding\">willing to accept</url> the use of data to personalize their services and display advertising predicted to be of interest to them, and Congress is unlikely to stop that. The same processes of personalization, however, can be used to modify behavior and beliefs. This is the core concern of Zuboff's book: the creation of a largely covert system of power and domination.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MAKE THEM DANCE</emphasis></p><p>From extracting data and making predictions, the technology firms have gone on to intervening in the real world. After all, what better way to improve predictions than to guide how people act? The industry term for shaping behavior is \"actuation.\" In pursuit of actuation, Zuboff writes, the technology firms \"nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions by executing actions as subtle as inserting a specific phrase into your Facebook news feed, timing the appearance of a BUY button on your phone, or shutting down your car engine when an insurance payment is late.\"\u00a0</p><p>Evidence of the industry's capacity to modify behavior on a mass scale comes from two studies conducted by Facebook. During the 2010 U.S. congressional elections, the company's researchers ran a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834737/\">randomized, controlled experiment</url> on 61 million users. Users were split up into three groups. Two groups were shown information about voting (such as the location of polling places) at the top of their Facebook news feeds; users in one of these groups also received a social message containing up to six pictures of Facebook friends who had already voted. The third group received no special voting information. The intervention had a significant effect on those who received the social message: the researchers estimated that the experiment led to 340,000 additional votes being cast. In a second experiment, Facebook researchers tailored the emotional content of users' news feeds, in some cases reducing the number of friends' posts expressing positive emotions and in other cases reducing their negative posts. They found that those who viewed more negative posts in their news feeds went on to make more negative posts themselves, demonstrating, as the title of the published article about the study put it, \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/24/8788.full.pdf?version=meter%20at%204&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\">massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks</url>.\"</p><p>The 2016 Brexit and U.S. elections provided real-world examples of covert disinformation delivered via Facebook. Not only had the company previously allowed the political consulting firm <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Cambridge Analytica</url>to harvest personal data on tens of millions of Facebook users; during the 2016 U.S. election, it also permitted microtargeting of \"unpublished page post ads,\" generally known as \"dark posts,\" which were invisible to the public at large. These were delivered to users as part of their news feeds along with regular content, and when users liked, commented on, or shared them, their friends saw the same ads, now personally endorsed. But the dark posts then disappeared and were never publicly archived. Micro-targeting of ads is not inherently illegitimate, but journalists are unable to police deception and political opponents cannot rebut attacks when social media deliver such messages outside the public sphere. The delivery of covert disinformation on a mass basis is fundamentally inimical to democratic debate.</p><p>Facebook has since eliminated dark posts and made other changes in response to public criticism, but Zuboff is still right about this central point: \"Facebook owns an unprecedented means of behavior modification that operates covertly, at scale, and in the absence of social or legal mechanisms of agreement, contest, and control.\" No law, for example, bars Facebook from adjusting its users' news feeds to favor one political party or another (and in the United States, such a law might well be held unconstitutional). As a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-youtube-drives-viewers-to-the-internets-darkest-corners-1518020478\">2018 study</url> by The Wall Street Journal showed, YouTube's recommendation algorithm was feeding viewers videos from ever more extreme fringe groups. That algorithm and others represent an enormous source of power over beliefs and behavior.\u00a0</p><p>Surveillance capitalism, according to Zuboff, is moving society in a fundamentally antidemocratic direction. With the advent of ubiquitous computing, the industry dreams of creating transportation systems and whole cities with built-in mechanisms for controlling behavior. Using sensors, cameras, and location data, Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, envisions a \"for-profit city\" with the means of enforcing city regulations and with dynamic online markets for city services. The system would require people to use Sidewalk's mobile payment system and allow the firm, as its CEO, Dan Doctoroff, explained in a 2016 talk, to \"target ads to people in proximity, and then obviously over time track them through things like beacons and location services as well as their browsing activity.\" One software developer for an Internet of Things company told Zuboff, \"We are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance.\"\u00a0</p><p>Such aspirations imply a radical inequality of power between the people who control the play list and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2018-08-13/data-people\">the people who dance to it</url>. In the last third of her book, Zuboff takes her analysis up a level, identifying the theoretical ideas and general model of society that she sees as implicit in surveillance capitalism. The animating idea behind surveillance capitalism, Zuboff says, is that of the psychologist B. F. Skinner, who regarded the belief in human freedom as an illusion standing in the way of a more harmonious, controlled world. Now, in Zuboff's view, the technology industry is developing the means of behavior modification to carry out Skinner's program.\u00a0</p><p>The emerging system of domination, Zuboff cautions, is not <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-09-17/how-win-battle-over-data\">totalitarian</url>; it has no need for violence and no interest in ideological conformity. Instead, it is what she calls \"instrumentarian\"-it uses everyday surveillance and actuation to channel people in directions preferred by those in control. As an example, she describes China's efforts to introduce a social credit system that scores individuals by their behavior, their friends, and other aspects of their lives and then uses this score to determine each individual's access to services and privileges. The Chinese system fuses instrumentarian power and the state (and it is interested in political conformity), but its emerging American counterpart may fuse instrumentarian power and the market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NO FUTURE?</emphasis></p><p>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a powerful and passionate book, the product of a deep immersion in both technology and business that is also informed by an understanding of history and a commitment to human freedom. Zuboff seems, however, unable to resist the most dire, over-the-top formulations of her argument. She writes, for example, that the industry has gone \"from automating information flows about you to automating you.\" An instrumentarian system of behavior modification, she says, is not just a possibility but an inevitability, driven by surveillance capitalism's own internal logic: \"Just as industrial capitalism was driven to the continuous intensification of the means of production, so surveillance capitalists are . . . now locked in a cycle of continuous intensification of the means of behavioral modification.\"\u00a0</p><p>As a warning, Zuboff's argument deserves to be heard, but Americans are far from mere puppets in the hands of Silicon Valley. The puzzle here is that Zuboff rejects a rhetoric of \"inevitabilism\"-\"the dictatorship of no alternatives\"-but her book gives little basis for thinking we can avoid the new technologies of control, and she has little to say about specific alternatives herself. Prophecy you will find here; policy, not so much. She rightly argues that breaking up the big technology companies would not resolve the problems she raises, although antitrust action may well be justified for other reasons. Some reformers have suggested creating an entirely new regulatory structure to deal with the power of digital platforms and improve \"algorithmic accountability\"-that is, identifying and remedying the harms from algorithms. But all of that lies outside this book.</p><p>The more power major technology platforms exercise over politics and society, the more opposition they will provoke-not only in the United States but also around the world. The global reach of American surveillance capitalism may be only a temporary phase. Nationalism is on the march today, and the technology industry is in its path: countries that want to chart their own destiny will not continue to allow U.S. companies to control their platforms for communication and politics.</p><p>The competition of rival firms and political systems may also complicate any efforts to reform the technology industry in the United States. Would it be a good thing, for example, to heavily regulate major U.S. technology firms if their Chinese rivals gained as a result? The U.S. companies at least profess liberal democratic values. The trick is passing laws to hold them to these values. If Zuboff's book helps awaken a countermovement to achieve that result, we may yet be able to avoid the dark future she sees being born today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORAFR-1124930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORAFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV6-F771-JCKT-T03F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7984</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Council on Foreign Relations, Inc.

In the ensuing years, as thousands of new cryptocurrencies were launched and cryptotrading made some speculators rich-or poor-overnight, bank officials remained wary. \"Overall, the decentralized technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money,\" a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report concluded in June 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But on January 21 this year, something changed. Six leading central banks from developed markets-the Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank (ECB), Sveriges Riksbank and Swiss National Bank-joined with the BIS in a coalition to appraise the potential of central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs), assessing \"CBDC use cases; economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability; and the sharing of knowledge on emerging technologies.\" It is expected to issue a report in a few months. Most of these central banks had toyed with the idea of CBDCs, but the coalition announcement suggested that an actual state-backed digital currency may be imminent.</p><p>Then the following day, January 22, a who's who of national and international financial leaders at Davos gathered for a \"special high-level, closed-door\" roundtable to discuss not only whether and how to accommodate new monies in the monetary architecture, but whether central banks should issue their own digital currencies. \"Or is the better strategy to update and upgrade existing structures?\" a briefing note for the event read.</p><p>That same month, the BIS released the latest findings of an annual survey of 66 central banks. Entitled Impending arrival-a sequel to the survey on central bank digital currency, it found that approximately 80% of central banks (up from 70% in 2018) were looking at CBDCs. Forty percent of central banks had progressed from the conceptual phases to experiments or proofs-of-concept, with another 10% (all from emerging-market economies) developing pilot projects.</p><p>What caused the change in attitude? In part, it was a natural evolution of thinking that grew out of research into digital currencies. \"Central banks were previously analyzing CBDCs, but the number of banks doing that were in the minority,\" says Gabriela Guibourg, an economist at Sweden's central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank. \"Now, the international landscape has changed dramatically.\"</p><p>But the real impetus came out of the private sector. On June 18 last year, tech giant Facebook announced it was leading a group-including global giants such as Mastercard, Visa and eBay-to create a new global digital currency: Libra. \"The web is 30 years old, [but we] still don't have an easy, cheap, efficient way for people to move money around,\" David Marcus, cocreator of Libra and former president of PayPal, stated at a panel discussion on digital currencies at Davos in January. Libra would be a \"stablecoin,\" linked to a basket of stable assets to reduce volatility. Libra coins would be minted by the independent, not-for-profit Libra Association, making it a kind of central bank.</p><p>Most importantly, while Libra is not the world's first stablecoin, Facebook's worldwide network meant it would be a global stablecoin, or GSC. An October 2019 report by the G7 Working Group on Stablecoins argues that, given GSCs' reach and ability to scale quickly, they could have a detrimental impact on monetary policy, sovereignty and financial stability.</p><p>\"Libra was a wake-up call for central banks all over the world,\" says Guibourg, who leads a team analyzing the legal aspects of an \"e-krona\" in Sweden. \"Although innovations from the private sector are often good for the market, some, like Libra, can be dangerous and have risks that are difficult to manage.\"</p><p>Guibourg notes that the power of network effects means a GSC like Libra could cause real harm to countries with smaller currencies. \"Defending the national currency unit of account is one of the main mandates of central banks,\" she points out.</p><p>Libra has made it more urgent, says Guibourg, for central banks to consider the potential of issuing CBDCs. Russia's central bank is actively exploring the concept as well as stablecoins backed by real assets. The latter \"have greater potential for use on the market as a means of investment and, in certain cases, a medium of exchange, but not as a means of payment,\" a central bank spokesperson tells <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Finance</emphasis>. However, the bank's view is that it is not obvious what additional benefits CBDCs offer compared to existing noncash payment instruments. The US Federal Reserve, for example, put CBDCs on a back burner, seeking instead to improve existing payment systems.</p><p>\"[A CBDC] is a very scary thing for a central bank,\" says Darrell Duffie, finance professor at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University. \"It completely changes the financial system in ways that are entirely unpredictable. Central banks are concerned about maintaining their political independence, which could be interfered with by governments and politicians if central banks are administering a digital currency.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the Libra threat may be less than it first appeared. Many of its most prominent members stepped back from the alliance by October. \"The threat is hardly imminent,\" analyst firm CB Insights writes in its 2020 Tech Trends report, \"but the risk is palpable enough that regulators in many countries have sought to clamp down on Libra and Bitcoin.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, technology marches on. \"Cash is disappearing in Sweden,\" notes Guibourg. Sweden's Riksbank started investigating the idea of an e-krona in 2017 as a way of ensuring the public continues to enjoy access to a state-guaranteed means of payment as cash declines. On February 20, the central bank announced an e-krona pilot in conjunction with Accenture. The pilot, which will run for a year, will enable payments, deposits and withdrawals with an e-krona from a mobile phone, card or watch. The Riksbank says the pilot does not mean it will actually launch an e-kronor in future, but it is not alone in its digital coin experiments.</p><p>\"We know that other central banks, because of rapid digitization and the entrance of big tech companies, are considering whether they need a CBDC,\" Guibourg adds. Banco Central Del Uruguay piloted an e-peso for six months in 2017-2018, during which consumers were able to access the e-peso via digital wallets. The pilot was deemed a success, and the bank is currently evaluating the future prospects for further trials or issuances.</p><p>The e-peso or e-krona would be a general-purpose CBDC, which can be used by members of the public and stored in digital wallets. Some central banks also talk about wholesale CBDCs, which would be used only in interbank transactions, such as cross-border payments and securities settlement. Guibourg argues central banks should now focus more on retail CBDCs to forestall preemption by an initiative like Libra.</p><p>Senegalese investment bank Banque Regionale de Marches launched the West African Economic and Monetary Union's first digital currency with help from fintech eCurrency Mint. Its eCFA is pegged to the CFA franc fiat currency. Other countries, namely France, Turkey and the Bahamas, have announced plans to commence CBDC pilots this year.</p><p>Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer at Gate.io, a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange platform, says a CBDC can transform the financial stability of a country as it allows central banks to have a better check on the financial expenditures of its citizens. \"It can also help in risk reduction, transparency and auditability, creating direct monetary policies that can in turn help curb corruption on a national level and drive overall financial inclusion for emerging economies,\" she says.</p><p>In China's case, the central bank's Digital Currency and Electronic Payment project, which is expected to be launched soon, is about having greater control and oversight of money flows. Some even suggest it could be used to circumvent the dominance of the US dollar in global trade. \"The Chinese are closest to launching something like this at scale,\" CB Insights writes. There is fevered speculation about which developedmarket central bank will actually be first to launch a CBDC. \"It is difficult to predict what will happen,\" says Guibourg of the Riksbank, but she believes CBDCs are likely to proceed quickly now in light of Libra.</p><p>HOW WOULD A CBDC WORK?</p><p>In terms of how the CBDC is distributed, it could be account based. In the case of general-purpose CBDCs, members of the public would need to hold an account at the central bank, something that doesn't happen today. CBDCs can also be token based, like the e-peso, where payments are made by transferring digital tokens. Central banks could issue digital currencies themselves or distribute them via a third party.</p><p>\"It's not obvious that the central bank needs to be the provider of the products that run on the rails,\" economist and Senior Minister of Singapore, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, stated at Davos during a panel discussion about creating a credible and trusted digital currency. \"Maybe in countries that have an inadequate financial sector, but I worry about [CBDCs] going too far into the retail sector.\"</p><p>CBDCs are likely to coexist alongside fiat currencies (that will provide a backup when electronic systems fail) and other digital currencies or stablecoins. \"I expect we'll see multiple different stablecoins, which will compete,\" Neha Narula, director of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, stated at Davos. \"But, ultimately, a CBDC is really the better choice, as it directly reduces risk and allows a central bank to provide a public option for money.\"</p><p>Striking the right balance between public and private sector digital currencies could prove challenging. At Davos, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, said flexibility and diversity will be important. \"There can be a mix of public and private solutions,\" he explained. \"We need that innovation coming from the private sector.\"</p><p>One example of how the private and public sector could potentially work together in digital currency is the IMF's proposal for a \"synthetic central bank digital currency (sCBDC),\" which would give private stablecoin issuers access to central bank reserves. \"This option minimizes the risk of private stablecoins and utilizes the advantages of large tech firms in issuing and managing digital currencies,\" states a December 2019 paper, Public or Private? The Future of Money, published by the European Parliament's Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies.</p><p>The Libra team believes it brings a good technological solution to the network for hosting stablecoins and CBDCs. Blockchain software technology company ConsenSys published a white paper in January proposing that CBDCs run on the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain is not essential for CBDCs to operate, but ConsenSys argues it provides the \"secure, global-scale, interoperable settlement platforms that CBDCs require.\" The Riksbank chose blockchain technology for its e-krona pilot.</p><p>Dan Popescu, an independent commodities and currencies analyst, speculates that the BIS group of central banks could end up creating something almost identical to Libra, but effectively owned by governments. It could be a form of \"digital SDR\" (special drawing rights), he says, which is what former IMF head and now president of the ECB Christine Lagarde referred to in a 2017 speech, when she spoke about more-stable virtual currencies that \"could be issued one-for-one for dollars, or a stable basket of currencies.\"</p><p>The question remains whether central banks can fully embrace digital currencies in any meaningful way that delivers real change and the creation of a monetary system that works for everyone. \"Central banks know and fully understand that, without doubt, the future of money lies in digital currencies; and they want a slice of the action,\" says Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory firm. \"However, they are intrinsically tied to the traditional and far-reaching system of fiat currencies and all its associated issues, which is-for the time being at least-holding them back from going all in.\"</p><p>In the BIS survey cited earlier, while the likelihood of central banks issuing any type of CBDC may have increased, 70% see themselves as unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. Another 10% indicated they were likely to issue a general purpose CBDC (for use by the general public) in one to three years, and 20% in one to six years.</p><p>Stanford's Duffie doubts we'll see a general purpose CBDC issued by a developed-market central bank in the next five years. He believes central banks are right to do their own R&amp;D on digital currencies, noting that \"even if a CBDC doesn't come to fruition, the mere idea of it has changed the discussion about payments and improving the existing payment systems.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Duffie, Stanford</emphasis>: Central bank digital currency completely changes the financial system in ways that are entirely unpredictable.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guibourg, Sveriges Riksbank</emphasis>: Libra was a wake-up call for central banks all over the world.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH0-T2J1-JC8V-4009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2167\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Finance Media, Inc.

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p>The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released today, identifies the trouble with Americas largest technology companies in four areasmarket structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring, says Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorney generals from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets and adds that the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, Zingales said. To preserve not only the independence but also the appearance of independence of the analysis, the center recruited scholars and experts who had not worked for, consulted with or acted as expert witness for or against Google or Facebook within the previous two years.</p><p>The policy recommendations from the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms build on the solutions formed by four subcommittees, each writing a separate report on its findings. The four subcommittee reports are Market Structure and Antitrust, Privacy and Data Protection, Media and Politics.</p><p>The key policy recommendations are as follows:</p><p>Force interoperability among social media, similar to how phone companies operate. Mandate an open and common application program interface that allows different messaging systems to connect to one another.</p><p>Change the threshold for merger review, basing it on transaction value or other criteria that allow regulators to scrutinize transactions between digital platforms and startups.</p><p>Create inside the FTC a Digital Authority, capable of overseeing all aspects of digital platforms. This DA would oversee how these companies collect data, set up rules allowing data portability among competing service providers and data sharing with third parties, promote open standards, and review mergers in parallel with the Justice Department.</p><p>Extend campaign disclosure obligations to specifically target digital platforms, including relationships with politicians, academic funding, and the intentional promotion or demotion of content related to political figures.</p><p>Adopt sticky pro-consumer default rules, forcing companies to actually explain data protection practices to consumers instead of just encouraging them to click I agree. Also discourage so-called dark patterns, or user interfaces that can confuse consumers or manipulate them.</p><p>Remove the safe-harbor protections associated with Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act for content actively promoted and monetized by digital platforms.</p><p>Promote investigative and democratic journalism by: (i) setting up pilot projects that instruct the development of alternative funding sources for local news media; and (ii) requiring antitrust authorities to consider media plurality when reviewing mergers between media companies.</p><p>Impose an additional fiduciary duty on the boards of monopolies, specifically a fiduciary duty toward society.</p><p>MEDIA CONTACT</p><p>Chicago</p><p>Sandra Jones</p><p>Senior Associate</p><p>Director</p><p>+1 773.834.5828</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sandra.jones@ChicagoBooth.edu\">sandra.jones@ChicagoBooth.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123193389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2R-4KS1-DYTH-G0PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It has a high price tag, less-powerful specs, fewer features, and foldable-smartphone[3] technology still has a long way to go before it's as reliable as regular smartphones. Instead, the new Razr[4] will appeal to those who value fashion and design. </p><p>After all, it looks like the iconic Razr from the mid 2000s that's been modernized into an ultra-sleek smartphone with a long, foldable screen. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. Whether you remember the original Motorola Razr from the mid 2000s or not, the new Motorola Razr foldable smartphone is the most desirable smartphone in years. It taps into nostalgic design without appearing dated in any way. And the way it folds is the best we've seen in any foldable smartphone so far because it makes your phone smaller when you're not using it[6] \u2014 perfect for freeing up space in your pocket or bag. And it's a device you can actually pre-order soon, on December 26. And you'll find it on store shelves at Verizon stores and some Walmart locations in January 2020. It's also more about looks rather than function and value, and there's certainly a good number of people who won't mind some of the new Razr's shortcomings when it looks so good. With that in mind, there are four good reasons a smartphone user who cares about performance and functionality shouldn't run out and pre-order or buy the new Motorola Razr, at least until these four things are addressed in future models. Check it out: At $1,500, the new Motorola Razr costs less than other foldable smartphones. But it's still a phone, and it costs hundreds more than even the priciest traditional smartphones. Motorola It has decent specs, but they're still not up to par with other high-end Android flagships. MotorolaThe new Razr has 6 GB of RAM, which is fine but on the low end compared to other flagship Android smartphones. The real point of concern with the new Razr is its chip. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 from 2018, while most high-end Android phones run on the Snapdragon 855 from 2019.The new Motorola Razr doesn't have many of the features you'd expect from a $1,500 high-end Android smartphone. MotorolaSome of the more notable missing features we've come to expect in expensive, high-end Android phones include: A triple-lens, or even dual-lens, camera system. Advanced facial recognition. A large battery. A charger with over 18W of charging power for faster charging. Wireless charging. Good water and dust resistance.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[7] See Also: Huawei exec says its 5G base stations perform better without components from US companies, but it still wants

(Photo: Flickr)<br/>By Angel Manuel Garc\u00eda Carmona<br/>In some Western (mainly European) countries, in theory, forced mass quarantines have come to an end (usually based on \"de-escalating\" processes). It is assumed, according to official data, that the incidence of coronavirus, encoded as COVID-19, is much lower than at the beginning of last spring.</p><p><br/>It is usual that after the storm or other storm, calm arrives (well, to give another example, it is also obvious that when someone recovers from cardiac surgery, they regain their normal activity). But in this case, they seem to be looking for a number of psychological perspective additives.<br/>Exclusively, while being informed of one-off re-openings with a conditional threat of re-establishment of political abduction (confinement), they tell us of a \"new normal\". It may sound like something redundant or a kurdish crude, but what's the real background?<br/>By \"prevention\", we are required to combine our routine with estrangement and use of masks<br/>Whether waiting for a vaccine (a matter that opens up a parallel discussion, but not for the general reasons of the anti-vaccine movement, which makes a combination of anti-market infundios and Darwinian natural selection games) or in order to \"contain re-registrations\", our return to normalcy is not being so \"free\".<br/>By decision of our bureaucrats on duty, always so interested in planning all the spontaneous social dynamics from a concentric point, we have to walk out to the street door with our mouth and nose literally covered (speaking rigorously, think that we use some protective sanitary utensil).<br/>We talk about so-called \"masks\" or, in some Spanish-American countries, \"cover\". Yes, and they don't care what we're going to use (there are those who have dared to recognize, with health judgment, their ineffectiveness, as they concentrate carbon dioxide and other microorganisms). They don't have to be the \"most effective\" FFP-2 and FFP-3.<br/>At the same time, we are imposed a \"social distance\" (under the pretext of immunological security) of between one and three meters in length (whether on the street, in the function rooms or in the places of worship), although, for logical reasons, on a terrace or at a restaurant table, it is impossible to do so if you go with your partner, your friends or your family.<br/>Adapting to the crisis and technological advances<br/>Regardless of the interference in the discussion in the previous paragraph, it is undeniable that certain technological trends (with their corresponding applications) have seen its process of permeability considerably accelerated, as a result of this \"crisis\".<br/>Whether it is to try to mitigate the effects of economic strangulation and the modalities of economic blockade, so as not to undermine academic training too much (not necessarily the one that is mandatory or significantly regulated) or to maintain social contact (albeit virtualized), the Internet has been key.<br/>Telework was, until now, a kind of social benefit granted by companies, for certain days of the week, with the sole intention of facilitating the personal and/or family reconciliation of the worker (just as a restaurant ticket or life insurance can be provided).<br/>However, in a matter of weeks, companies have had to adapt to it at an astronomical rate, without having had too many productivity problems. In fact, they believe it can help reduceinfrastructure, and is highlighted in current job openings. So you can say he's here to stay.<br/>The same goes for e-learning, which while it was gaining its popularity in the university and extracurricular area (not necessarily through platforms such as edX and Udemy), is generating a market momentum that leads face-to-face units to reinvent themselves to survive for the future.<br/>On the other hand, for better and worse, with the applications mentioned above, one can corroborate that four trends will be key: Big Data, cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence. They were advancing and gaining market relevance and the productive fabric, but this drives them.<br/>No spontaneous order or health security<br/>As noted above, the political class (with the corresponding collaboration of a given press) has an interest in us taking up the new normal as a season of health caution. Although if we think about technological advances, better for them, within their interested anesthesiology.<br/>However, the \"new normal\" that, in collaboration with ideologues, other bureaucrats, certain elites, Big Tech and various agit-prop units, becomes a breakthrough in the political order that they intend, based on the fifth revolutionary phase (whether or not we call it the \"NOM criterion\").<br/>Without discussing the sanitary incidence (as well as its possible result of human action in a laboratory that should already be quite well known), it is true that this situation has been seen as an opportunity to carry out one of the largest contemporary social trials, playing with \"collective psychosis\" and Stockholm syndrome.<br/>The decrees of \"state of alarm\" or \"state of emergency\" have reinforced the power springs of not a few rulers (Spain is a considerable example of this, as well as an example of postmodern dictatorship, commanded by socialists and communists such as Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Pablo Iglesias). See as an application of martial laws.<br/>At the same time, warning of uncoordinated chaos when it has been reciprocated, efforts have been made to influence the \"need\" to move towards the global single state (zero decentralization), which based on a false artificial religion, will also bet on a fierce economic interventionism.<br/>On the other hand, in economic matters, apart from questioning the lack of freedom that many of these modern states generally ensure, the aim is to strengthen the role of central banks that create very artificial credit masses. But you're trying to get used to not paying cash.<br/>The problem they have with cash is not \"obsolescence\" or \"health.\" They basically take advantage of the Pisuerga pass through Pucela so that no economic transaction escapes state control (in this way, they can further expose), with which the big businesses of the financial sector collaborate very closely.<br/>In addition, the control of financial transactions adds to the greater threat to our privacy, through thermal cameras, certain video surveillance systems and so-called anti-COVID19 apps, with which, in fact, we seek to monitor the slightest movement of the citizen.<br/>Therefore, having already finalized, if we want to make sense of the concept of \"new normal\", let us consider it a euphemism that actually implies a game with propaganda and \"false insecurity\" to strangle society and nullify its freedoms, violating market freedom, subsidiarity and other natural patterns.<br/>Garc\u00eda Carmona is a software engineer and resides in Madrid, Spain.<br/>When we started the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PanAm Post</emphasis> to try to carry thetruth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge.

But, at the recent Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, he instantly became the new best friend of every Internet entrepreneur in the room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why? In unusually blunt language, he made it clear that Microsoftwants to buy their companies. Speaking on stage during a Q&amp;A session, he even offered up his email (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:steveb@microsoft.com\">steveb@microsoft.com</email>), all but begging technology entrepreneurs to pitch him anytime they want.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"My god, you're about to get a thousand e-mails,\" the event moderator gasped. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Maybe one will be worth buying,\" Ballmer responded.</p><p>In fact, Ballmer said he's looking to purchase 20 companies a year for the next five years at price tags of between $50 million and $1 billion. Perhaps most interesting, Ballmer said he'll mainly be targeting smaller companies. \"Most will be footnotes. We're talking about acquisitions of $50 million, $100 million, $200 million. Those are good acquisitions that are important to us and of strategic value.\"</p><p>This is music to the ears of many entrepreneurs who dream of striking it rich overnight, often without having to worry about business models, profitability or long-term value - or, perhaps more ironically, the kinds of things a business typically needs to succeed.</p><p>With all the acquisition activity these days, it probably makes sense for entrepreneurs to aim for an easy M&amp;A exit. But don't tell that to Brad Feld, a managing director at VC firm Foundry Group in Boulder, CO. Feld believes startups are increasingly being created specifically for a quick flip to the likes of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Cisco - and he doesn't like it one bit.</p><p>\"Many entrepreneurs have a fantasy of a quick exit to a big tech company in less than 24 months,\" he says. \"It's a silly fantasy. Given the desire of all of us to have People Magazine-like celebrity moments, companies and founders that pull this off are praised loudly. But approaching your startup with this expectation is very bad odds. Go to Vegas instead if this is your mentality.\"</p><p>Feld and his venture capital partners at Foundry Group know at thing or two about selling startups to corporate acquirers. This year alone, they hit pay dirt with three of their investments. Feedburner, a content syndication and management service, was acquired by Googlefor an estimated $100 million. Sling Media, which sells devices that transmit television shows from a consumer's TV to a remote computer, was snapped up by EchoStar Communications for $380 million. And Postini, a provider of on-demand security and archiving services for e-mail and instant messaging systems, was bought by Googlefor $625 million.</p><p>Though Feld refuses to comment on any of his recent deals, he says the technology industry is clearly on a buying binge. \"Tech companies are acquiring at a rapid rate, usually using cash generated from operations as a way to expand their business footprint and invest in R&amp;D.\"</p><p>It's not just the technology industry that's banking on acquisitions to fuel its growth, but also the energy sector. \"If you look back at the energy business, the amount of revenue reinvested back into R&amp;D is a very low number compared to other industries,\" says Neil Suslak, managing director at Braemer Energy Ventures in New York City. \"This has created pent-up demand for new technology, and all of the drivers are coming together now. You are starting to see companies like GE, Siemens, and some of the chemical companies making acquisitions of early-stage, venture-backed businesses, and we think that the trend is going to continue.\"</p><p>Overall, this has been a banner year for venture-backed M&amp;A. Research firm Dow Jones VentureOne reports that 90 venture-backed companies raised more than $10.5 billion in M&amp;A transactions in the third quarter of this year, a 31% increase over the same period last year and the highest quarterly amount since 2000. Jessica Canning, director of global research for Dow Jones VentureOne, says that 2007 is virtually guaranteed to be the largest year for venture-backed liquidity in the U.S. since the dot-com bubble.</p><p>What's driving the trend? First, with profits continuing to grow, technology companies have a lot more available cash. And they are actively looking to reinvest it via acquisition. Another factor is the desire on the part of largest technology companies to stay competitive with their closest rivals. In other words, it's the \"Googleeffect.\"</p><p>Google, has been gobbling up startups to rapidly fill holes in its product line - and its forcing other companies like Yahoo!, Microsoft, Cisco and AOL to do the same. \"No question, Googlewill continue to make more acquisitions,\" says Gordon Ritter, general partner at Emergence Capital Partners in San Mateo, CA. \"Everyone is feeling the pressure to bring on new innovations just to keep up with Google.\"</p><p>Moreover, tech companies are increasingly relying on startups to act as their de facto research and development division. In fact, MicrosoftCFO Chris Liddell is on record as saying the company will spend more this fiscal year on acquisitions than on R&amp;D for the first time in its history.</p><p>\"Time to market is really feeding corporate appetites,\" says Paul Kedrosky, a well-known industry commentator and venture partner at VC firm Ventures West in Vancouver, BC. \"Companies realize they are better off paying $20 million today for something that might only cost $10 million to build themselves, but wouldn't be ready for another two years. It's worth it to do the deal now and get to market quickly.\"</p><p>Take Cisco Systems. Over the past 15 years, it's been one of the most active acquirers in the technology industry, purchasing a total of 125 companies since 1993. This year alone, it has bought 11 more businesses. \"There is always opportunity to take advantage of disruptive ideas and innovation that happens outside of Cisco,\" says Charles Carmel, director of corporate business development at Cisco.</p><p>Cisco typically makes an acquisition for one of two reasons: either to fill a hole in its portfolio, or to quickly enter new markets where it wants to be, but has little or no foothold. Earlier this year, for example, it paid $3.2 billion for WebEx. \"That was a large transaction that immediately brought us into web-based collaboration, an area where we have not historically had a large presence,\" Carmel explains. \"We believe in using acquisitions as an immediate way to become a market leader.\"</p><p>Cisco has also completed plenty of smaller transactions to beef up areas where it's strong, but wants to get even stronger. The most recent example is Cisco's purchase of Latigent, a provider of call center reporting tools. \"This was a smaller deal that fit into our market expansion category,\" Carmel says. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Cisco says the acquisition gives it the advance functionality it currently lacks in its own call center offering.</p><p>Acquisitions like Latigent are no fluke. They are born of a very precise strategy. In fact, the notion of identifying a hole in the portfolio of a large company like Cisco, and then creating a startup to fill that gap in the hopes of eventually getting acquired, is a time-honored tradition in the technology industry. And given the volume of activity today, a lot of entrepreneurs find it more sensible to build a company for acquisition rather than, say, an IPO.</p><p>Some buttoned-up VCs strenuously disagree. They will stress that's it's impossible to build a business for M&amp;A, because if the buyer goes away, so does the startup. They'll tell entrepreneurs to build long-term companies that can become a significant, viable standalone business. And they'll also say that an IPO is the only way for startups to hit the kind of eye-popping homeruns that investors dream about.</p><p>This is all very sage advice. But the fact of the matter is that, except for a few rare cases, M&amp;A has become the only viable exit opportunity these days. Yes, the IPO market is finally starting to show signs of life, but it still pales in comparison to a sale to a larger, more established business looking to add new technologies or product lines. Plus, thanks to new regulatory requirements and a greater focus on profitability, the bar to going public is higher than ever before.</p><p>\"If you go back over a 30-year period, 90% of exits have been [through] M&amp;A,\" says Bart Schachter, managing director of VC firm Blueprint Ventures in San Francisco. </p><p>\"At the peak of the Internet bubble, those numbers were about 50/50 between IPO and M&amp;A, but that was an anomaly. Some investors still have a hard time accepting that those days are probably gone for good.\"</p><p>Instead of lamenting the decline of the IPO market, he believes venture investors should figure out how to profit from the M&amp;A market. But he admits that making exorbitant, ten-bagger, type of returns from a sale can be a real challenge for VCs. After all, while blockbuster acquisitions like Google's $1.6 billion purchase of YouTube clearly exist, most deals command just a fraction of that price. More typical is a company grinding through $30 million in venture financing before getting bought for $50 million.</p><p>\"No question, M&amp;A pays less than IPOs, but that just means you have to build companies that can deliver a venture-style return even on an M&amp;A exit,\" Schachter says. \"It's great that Microsoftwants to buy startups for $100 million, but if you spend just as much building your company, the M&amp;A market is of no use to you. It only works if you can build a company with relatively little capital.\"</p><p>Blueprint Ventures pursues what it calls a \"capital efficiency\" model. It begins with the assumption that successful portfolio companies will command between $100 million to $300 million in an acquisition. That means a startup can raise no more than $25 million in total venture capital for Blueprint to realize a decent return.</p><p>But where to find projects that require $25 million or less, with the potential to return 10 times that amount? Blueprint Ventures believes one way to do that is by seeking early-stage corporate intellectual property (IP) spinouts. For Blueprint, that means extracting IP assets from a corporate parent that has already spent tens of millions or more on a project, but no longer has the desire to move forward with it.</p><p>Most recently, Blueprint backed a company called OnPath Technologies that was spun out of Brocade, a provider of network storage technology. Brocade spent $60 million developing the technology, but Blueprint was able to pick it up for pennies on the dollar. \"Basically, we were able to invest in it for the same price you'd pay for a garage startup,\" says Schachter. \"We think we can get OnPath to cash-flow breakeven for under $10 million. So if we can sell it for $150 million down the road, that's a very capital efficient model.\"</p><p>Other firms are pursuing capital efficiency by betting on startups from India and China, which require considerably less money to build out than U.S.-based startups. And then there is Second Avenue Partners, an early-stage venture capital fund in Seattle, which is targeting Web 2.0 companies. These next-generation Internet startups can increasingly be built from start to finish with only a few million dollars. That's substantially less than the tens of millions, sometimes even hundreds of millions, it typically took to fund a dot-com in the bubble days.</p><p>One of Second Avenue's most successful investments is Newsvine, a social media and citizen journalism site that was acquired in October by MSNBC for an undisclosed amount. \"From a venture capital point of view, the risk-return is high because the investment is relatively low,\" explains Nick Hanauer, a partner at Second Avenue. \"Newsvine was a small bet. It doesn't take $50 million to crank this thing up and get it working. If we invest $1 million and get $10 million back, that's fine. I don't need to get $100 million back.\"</p><p>Though most VCs won't admit it, an acquisition can actually be preferable to an IPO. \"If the deal is for cash, as many are today, immediate liquidity is a huge advantage,\" says Foundry Group's Feld. \"An acquisition is a determined value at the point of the deal, whereas companies that go public often have huge volatility, both up and down, during their first few quarters, especially if the market turns south or they miss their numbers by even a tiny bit.\"</p><p>Quick and predictable liquidity is important to VCs because it allows them to distribute cash to their limited partners. And giving money back increases the odds that VCs can raise capital for future funds, thus ensuring their existence. \"In some cases, I'd rather get $100 million in an M&amp;A exit today than $200 million in an IPO six months from now,\" says Hany Nada, managing partner of VC firm Global Granite Ventures in Menlo Park, CA.</p><p>But then again, there are some cases where Nada would rather not deal with a corporate acquirer at all. For him, it's not a matter of money but rather of trust. Nada, for one, believes that companies like Microsoftmight be making noise about their acquisition strategy simply to get a free look at innovative technology without any serious intent to buy. \"No question, Microsoftstarts to see really good deal flow when it makes statements like that,\" he says.</p><p>In fact, earlier this year, one of Nada's portfolio companies was about to be acquired by a much larger competitor, when the deal suddenly fell apart. The next thing Nada knew, the strategic acquirer was presenting his portfolio company's product map to customers as if it were their own. \"We spent several months with this acquirer and went down as far as technical due diligence,\" says Nada. \"I now tell my companies to play it close to the vest.\"</p><p>While this was clearly a worst-case scenario, corporate acquirers do learn quite a bit about the current state of technology innovation by taking a lot of meetings. Indeed, Cisco admits that for every company it buys, it looks at 100 more.</p><p>But some people believe that VCs and entrepreneurs should take whatever meeting they can, especially since the blistering pace of acquisition could subside at any moment. \"There have been a few horrible acquisitions recently that are starting to have a chilling effect on M&amp;A activity,\" Kedrosky says.</p><p>He's primarily referring to eBay's $2.6 billion acquisition of Skype. Though the deal happened two years ago, it's now public knowledge that there are serious flaws in the union. In October, eBay admitted that it overpaid for Skype by nearly $1 billion, and that the online phone service has not performed up to forecasts. \"Obviously we're disappointed by the writedown, but the price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake,\" said eBay CEO Meg Whitman at the same Web 2.0 Summit where Ballmer made his grand proclamation.</p><p>\"Big companies are increasingly afraid to pull the trigger because of these bad deals,\" Nada says. \"They were sold a grandiose vision that never materialized. That's making them very nervous going forward.\"</p><p>Google's acquisition of Jotspot is rumored to be another deal where the integration has not gone well, causing the Internet giant to second-guess its acquisition strategy. \"This deal is notorious in the venture industry,\" says a VC who requested anonymity. \"It's reputed that Googlehad to rewrite the entire Jotspot code from the ground up, and it's still questionable whether any products will come out of it. Googleholds Jotspot out as an example in every negotiation it enters as a way to knock down the purchase price.\"</p><p>But if <person><nameText>Steve Ballmer </nameText></person>is to be believed, corporations are eager to do more acquisitions, even if they aren't so willing to pay massive amounts. For VCs, the mandate is clear: build companies for less money and sell out at a respectable price. These deals might not be the homeruns they dream of, but with enough singles and doubles a good VC can still end up with the batting crown.  </p><p>(c) 2008 Mergers and Acquisitions Journal and SourceMedia, Inc.

It is like the Hulk breaking out of Dr. Banner: It is unstoppable and yet also destructive. In just a short couple of months, they have shunned free-market ideals that many free-market conservatives have worked years on educating members, staff, and the public on and embraced big government command and control. From big tech to drug prices, the more they can display these feats of big government strength the more eager they are to flex their newfound big government muscles. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And that doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping anytime soon. </p><p>Earlier this month, a new attack on the pharmaceutical industry was introduced in the Senate, S.1416. In other years, Congress might have pursued real solutions to high drug prices in the form of bills that leverage free-market principles. But in this era of populism, the bill employs big government policies to tell pharmaceutical companies what products will be considered new. In the 26-page bill, the decision is left to 28-year-old bureaucrats to decide if an advancement is significant or not. </p><p>The bill\u2019s intent is to bring down drug prices by attempting to allow more generics. But like most pieces of legislation (or any work product that is produced by people that have little understanding), it misses the mark and instead will likely just leave us all facing more diarrhea or other side effects that might not be considered \u201csignificant\u201d by some ill-informed bureaucrat. </p><p>The primary misunderstanding of the innovation system is that there is a way to extend a patent. The genius of the patent system is that there is an end. For instance, if a company invented a drug to cure cancer and patented it, at the end of that patent, anyone can produce that drug. However, maybe during that time it is found out that while it cured cancer, everyone also develops non-life-threatening diarrhea. If they then file a patent on a new version that doesn\u2019t cause stomach issues, currently they could produce that new version, and generics could produce the diarrhea-inducing version. The new bill, S.1416, discourages the creation of the new unflawed version. </p><p>I guess that makes S.1416 a diarrhea-inducing bill \u2014 maybe it should be listed as a side effect of the legislation.</p><p>The right people to make decisions about what drug should be prescribed aren\u2019t a bureaucrat and an economist; the right people to make the decisions about what drug to take are the patient and the doctor. They benefit by having more choices rather than less. The real shame in the introduction of this bill, other than circumventing the doctor-patient relationship, is that it attacks the patents system and employs more market-stifling regulation instead of seeking to use less, which means less choices for doctors to choose from. </p><p>There is a lot of room for real free-market improvements in the pharmaceutical industry without adding more bureaucracy. For instance, President Trump is attempting to fix the way that rebates for prescription drugs are handled. This alone could help significantly bring down the costs of some of the highest-priced drugs on the market. The way that this works can get a bit complicated but from a recent American Action Forum Study:  </p><p>Drug manufacturers provide rebates\u2014averaging roughly 30 percent\u2014to insurance plans for many of the rather expensive drugs taken by a small percentage of beneficiaries. The common practice now is for insurers to aggregate these rebates and use them to uniformly reduce premiums for all beneficiaries. In other words, rather than reduce the high out-of-pocket (OOP) costs faced by those beneficiaries, insurers instead provide all of their beneficiaries a small piece of the savings through slight discounts in premiums.</p><p>Therefore, the current \u201crebate\u201d system benefits the healthy over the sick, which is the exact opposite way that a healthcare market should function. At least starting to fix this system is healthy free-market reform that helps restore normal market features (pricing signals) and also helps make some of the most expensive drugs more affordable for the people that need them. </p><p>Under the current era of populism, this type of common-sense reform faces more hurdles than it would have in the past, but structuring an insurance system that helps the sick and high-cost users instead of penalizing them is good policy.</p><p>It is easy for the politicians to fall back on populist solutions; it makes them feel powerful like the Hulk. But the side effect is that it can also be aggressively destructive. </p><p>Charles Sauer (@CharlesSauer) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.

News publishers say online platforms have control over digital-advertising revenue and that the journalism industry should see more of that money. A study released[4] on Monday, which has sparked debate and received pushback among some in the publishing industry, says Google made about $4.7 billion in advertising off the news industry in 2018 \u2014 just $400 million less than what the US news industry itself brought in from ads. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. News-industry leaders will appear in front of Congress on Tuesday to discuss how tech giants such as Google and Facebook have harmed the journalism business. </p><p>Adding to the growing calls to scale back the power[6] of major tech companies, representatives from the journalism world are expected to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, commercial, and administrative law to argue that Silicon Valley tech companies have threatened the survival of the industry and should receive additional regulatory oversight, The Hill reported[7]. News publishers say that online platforms such as Google and Facebook have disrupted the ability for news outlets to get their share of digital-advertising revenue generated from ads that run alongside their content. According to numbers from the Save Journalism Project[8], a nonprofit advocating for the news industry, 63% of digital-ad revenue is controlled by Google and Facebook. \"Google and Facebook and Apple, they control so much of the ability to get your information out there, to get your stories out, and then they control so much of the ad revenue coming back in that it's crippling the industry again,\" Save Journalism Project's cofounder John Stanton told The Hill[9]. The hearings may include discussion of a bill that would give news publishers temporary exemptions from antitrust regulations so they can work together to collectively bargain with online platforms to divvy up advertising revenue. Called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act[10], the bill hopes to \"provide a temporary safe harbor for the publishers of online content to collectively negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the terms on which their content may be distributed.\" Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, a study from the News Media Alliance[11] published in The New York Times estimated that Google made $4.7 billion in advertising revenue tied to the news industry in 2018. That's only $400 million less than what the US news industry itself is estimated to have brought in from digital advertising last year. The study seeks to highlight just how much Google makes from digital advertising, and says publishers see only a fraction of the total revenue. David Chavern, the News Media Alliance's president, told The New York Times[12] that the news industry \u2014 whose journalists produce the money-generating content \u2014 deserve a cut of what Google makes. However, Google says[13] News Media Alliance's findings are inaccurate \"back of the envelope calculations.\" The journalist and professor Jeff Jarvis said Google has actually helped publishers by directing internet searches and readers toward their websites. \"The problem has long been that publishers aren't competent at exploiting the full value of these clicks by creating meaningful and valuable ongoing relationships with the people sent their way,\" Jarvis wrote in a Medium post[14]. \"The real problem here is news publishers' dogged refusal to understand how the internet has changed their world, throwing the paradigm they understood into the grinder.\" The congressional subcommittee hearing, titled \"Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 1: The Free and Diverse Press,\" kicks off at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday.NOW WATCH: 9 simple ways to protect your data that don't take much time, but could have huge security benefits[15]See Also: 2 key players of the Microsoft antitrust trial 20 years ago explain why its lessons will be critical to regulating Google, Amazon, and Facebook[16]Trump says tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon 'discriminate against' him and colluded with Democrats during his election run[17]Trump drops the biggest hint yet that he's coming after the big-tech 'monopoly' with potential billion-dollar fines[18] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/congress?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/category/congress?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newsmediaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Benefit-from-News-Content.pdf\">http://www.newsmediaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Benefit-from-News-Content.pdf</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-google-facebook-and-amazon-intensify-antitrust-debate-11559966461\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-google-facebook-and-amazon-intensify-antitrust-debate-11559966461</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/447532-news-industry-joins-calls-for-more-scrutiny-of-big-tech\">https://thehill.com/homenews/media/447532-news-industry-joins-calls-for-more-scrutiny-of-big-tech</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://savejournalism.org\">https://savejournalism.org</url>/ [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/447746-former-buzzfeed-bureau-chief-says-google-facebook-are-crippling-news-industry\">https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/447746-former-buzzfeed-bureau-chief-says-google-facebook-are-crippling-news-industry</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2054/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Hr+2054%22%5D%7D\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2054/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Hr+2054%22%5D%7D</url>...

View original post here[2]. Authored by Daisy Luther via The Organic Prepper blog,[3] Lately, I've written a lot about thealternative media purge[4]and how Big Techsocial media platforms are attempting to control the narrative[5], theelections[6], and public perception through censorship and financial blacklisting. Lots of people are ready to leave websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for less-censored pastures. But what are the social media alternatives that are currently available? </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/social-media-eye.jpg?itok=KcjAMhVbHere\">https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/social-media-eye.jpg?itok=KcjAMhVbHere</url> are some social media alternatives to check out.Before we get into the alternatives, please understand that all of them will start small. None of them will be able to take on Big Tech without a lot of help and support. We've gotten used to free social media because the companies with whom we've dealt have virtually raped us, reading our so-called 'private' messages, and pillaging our date to sell to the highest bidders. So really, it isn't that free after all. You probably won't find your parents, your best friend from kindergarten, and your Aunt Suzie on these platforms - not yet, anyway. But what you WILL be able to do is speak without fear of censorship. You'll be able to find your favorite alternative media sources there and find answers that simply aren't supported by the mainstream. The only way to change this dystopian atmosphere is to actually make changes ourselves. Go where the freedom is!MeWe[7]MeWe calls themselves The Next-Gen Social Network. They raised$4.8 million and launched back in 2016[8]to take on Facebook and Twitter. They're about 6 million members strong so far and Mark Weinstein, the founder, plans for it to be500 million by 2022.'In the future,MeWe will also revolutionize social media with decentralization, which will render Facebook's spying and tracking data model completely obsolete,'Weinstein added, a comment that suggests he is indeed trying to replace Facebook. 'Awareness around the world has never been higher regarding news feed manipulation and privacy infractions. Government regulations will never truly interfere with Facebook's data collection model, evidenced in bothCalifornia's new 2020 privacy rules[9]andEurope's GDPR[10]. But the free market can \u2014 and MeWe is here giving people great communication technology in a true multi-feature platform, with none of Facebook's BS.' (source[11])Gohere to get a MeWe account[12].Gab.ai[13]Gab.ai is a platform that is similar to Twitter. You have 300 characters with which to make your point. It has been called the Alt-Right's social media alternative and although Gab itself doesn't censor its users,Microsoft has threatened to take them down[14]due to 'hate speech.' A lot of folks who gotbanned, shadowbanned, or censored by Twitter[15]are there. Gab founder Andrew Torba feels that they aren't being portrayed honestly in the media.We survived a relentless and coordinated smear campaign by the dishonest mainstream media without any outside funding from advertisers or venture capitalists. Our community will continue to thrive and grow thanks to individuals from around the world who believe in putting people and free speech above politically correct corporate agendas. Gab has always and will always be powered by you, The People.Gab is not just a social network, it's a social movement.(source[16])With any social network, what you see in your feed will depend on who your friends are and who you follow. You canjoin Gab here.[17]Real.Video (Brighteon)[18]Real.Video was started by Mike Adams of Natural News in response to mass deplatforming on YouTube.This is the YouTube alternative to give voices and free speech to those who are being systematically targeted and censored by YouTube, Facebook, Google, and Twitter for essentially being a pro-Liberty[19]person, standing up for America, standing up for the Bill of Rights or just basic human rights for that matter. (source[20])Adams would know about censorship firsthand, since last year,Google delisted his site, Natural News[21], from its search engine results. Real.Video is in the process ofchanging its name to Brighteon.com[22]and hosts numerous videos that were banned by Twitter. It's still in the developmental stages, so there's an occasional glitch but thus far it has been a relatively smooth user experience. Check out Real.Video/Brighteon here[23].Mastodon[24]Another budding network is Mastodon, which has the tagline 'Giving social media back to you.' It's a free, open-source network, which means that developers can contribute to itbecause its design is publicly accessible.Ultimately Mastodon is a decentralized alternative to all the commercial social network platforms, which means that no single company owns it or can monopolize your communication. (source[25])I found it confusing to use (maybe you need to be more techy?) and was put off by the fact that I needed to log in via Twitter. Perhaps this is just so you can connect with the same people. It's always worthwhile to look at your options. Mastodon was started byEugen Rochko, who was fed up with the changes that Twitter was making that closely resembled the Facebook algorithms.Last year, after Twitterbegan moving away from a purely chronological feed[26], Rochko began building the back end for what would become Mastodon. Instead of building a unified service, Rochko envisioned something more like email, or RSS: a distributed system that lets you send public messages to anyone who follows you on the service. Anyone can create a server andhost their own instance of Mastodon[27], and Mastodon works in the background to connect them. (source[28])Here's abeginner's guide to using Mastodon[29], andhere's where you can join[30]. If you can figure this out, maybe you can explain it to me?Diaspora[31]Diaspora is a social network built on three cornerstones: decentralization, freedom, and privacy. To join Diaspora, you have to choose a 'pod' which is a group of potentially like-minded people. Each pod is independently hosted which should lessen the likelihood of corporate censorship. You can follow hashtags that interest you, and you can categorize people by how you know them (family, friends, work, etc.) Then you can control who sees the different things that you post.Diaspora is decentralized which means no one person owns it. This means that it doesn't have any form of advertisement and corporate interference. It also does not collect any of your data. When you create your account, you are responsible for your own data and retain the ownership of your personal data. Unlike Facebook, Diaspora allows you to use whatever identity you want, so pseudonyms and nicknames are fine to display as your profile. (source[32])Go here to find yourself a pod on Diaspora[33].Or you canjoin an old-fashioned forum[34].I know that personally, I'm not too jazzed about the learning curve of some of these new options and prefer the more familiar layouts of Real.Video (Brighteon), MeWe, and Gab. But honestly, people on social media can just be so horrible thatSelco Begovic and I started an old-fashioned forum[35]that is a throw-back to the 90s/early 2000s. I like forums because they're familiar, comfortable, and they draw likeminded people together. While there are tens of thousands of forums out there, if you are interested in freedom, self-reliance, and survival, I hope you'll join ours. For privacy reasons, we ask you NOT to use your real name anywhere on the registration form. All we need is a real email address to send you password updates, etc. Go here to joinThe Survival ...lf-Reliance Forum[36]with Selco and Daisy.There are social media options.Humans are social creatures. No matter how introverted we might be, we all seek connections with others. These days a lot of those connections are online. Thanks to the internet, it's never been easier to find like-minded people. I personally have friends from around the world who I met online that I never would have crossed paths with otherwise. Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have taken advantage of our desire to do this. They 'hooked' people then they manipulated what the users would see with algorithms. They collected every word you ever typed on social media and made assessments about you so they could sell that information to advertisers. They made a fortune off of every person who ever used their services, and deep down in the fine print, people gave them permission to do so. Now they're trying to control the narrative by removing people who dissent against things like war, police brutality, and corrupt politicians. If you're looking for an alternative social media outlet, check out some of the options above. They won't be able to take on Big Tech without us.

The challenge is to bring that data together, not just to call the advisor to take an action, but also to look for opportunities within the relationships. By using advanced analytics to look for opportunity, advisors will improve their value proposition. They can improve investment decision by looking, digitally, to see if something was overlooked in the portfolio or if there was a significant change in the market. Synthesizing data just makes the financial advisor's life a lot easier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What are the biggest benefits of mobile applications?</p><p>If an advisor is sitting down with a client at dinner and wants to touch base on the account, the advisor can take a quick peek at the mobile app and find the client's retirement account, or the account balance of an IRA, in real-time and make changes to those accounts in real-time. Those capabilities automatically add value to the relationship. If the advisor is on a train and gets a reminder of a client's birthday and touches base with the client - it's all of that stuff. Even just staying up to date on market news and how that's related to the client portfolio.</p><p>What trends do you see in advisor tech?</p><p>There are a handful of tools that have started out life as very consumer-driven tools. Now, a handful of firms are directly coming up with versions for enterprise users. They are beginning to change strategy and shift toward serving the advisors - instead of the retail clients. That has been a boon for our business. Tools are coming to market with the advisor in mind, like account opening tools, portfolio modeling and product suggestions. It all plays into the end goal of making the financial advisor more efficient and effective.</p><p>How do you see robo advice playing out in the new few years?</p><p>Robo advisors certainly have a place in this industry. It reminds me of my time in the early 2000s working with Merrill Lynch as the firm moved into the online trading space that served a certain target of investors in the marketplace. For some investors, online trading was simply a complement. For others, it wasn't really necessary for that relationship. Robo advisors serve a segment of clients. However, there is something about having a human being on the other end of the phone when you're talking about financial goals and wants and the needs. You can't call up a computer. When the markets are falling and clients have questions or when a client goes through a significant life challenge, advisors become irreplaceable.</p><p>What are the biggest disruptors?</p><p>The biggest disruptor will continue to leverage artificial intelligence to mine, cull and pull so much more information to improve the investment process and the planning process for clients. We look at the fintech space, and particularly in wealthtech, and just see so much money pouring into those firms and so much innovation. Now, the funding is coming from different geographies as well. It was predominantly the U.S. just a few years ago. Who knows what the next disruptor will be? There is just so much data. And, that means, big challenges and big opportunities.</p><p>Will technology firms enter the wealth management?</p><p>A lot of people have been talking about the big tech companies for a while. I haven't seen any real movement. I think everyone goes through the mental exercise: \"What happens if Amazon gets into wealth management?\" And, it doesn't mean that such a large player and large capital couldn't enter the space. I just don't see it happening. There are regulatory hoops that need to be met to get into this business - the compliance and supervision necessary that we need to be able to function properly. The tech players would have to deal with a lot of new supervision that they haven't necessarily face before. I haven't seen it happening yet.</p><p>How are firms tackling cybersecurity?</p><p>What keeps all of us up at night as IT professionals is the potential for a sophisticated cyber attack on our business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-00000169-3008-d29c-a9fb-33b9d3580000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHN-G8T1-JCRW-51KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Then Russia-sponsored trolls used social media to help rig the 2016 election, a bipartisan techlash took hold, and people in politics started talking about whether it's a good idea for a handful of firms to have so much power. Now, as formerly beloved corporate behemoths and their once-marginalized opposition funnel cash into Washington trying to influence the debate over Big Tech, Barry Lynn and his team are at the nexus of it all.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Luke Mullins</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Barry Lynn learned that everything was about to go public,     he realized he didn't have much time. So he called his wife and asked her     to bring the car downtown to the headquarters of New America, the     center-left think tank that had been his professional home for 15 years.     She arrived shortly thereafter with the family's Toyota Highlander and a     neighbor's 17-year-old son-there to pitch in some extra     muscle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Up in the office sat Lynn's most valuable possessions: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Federalist Papers,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wealth of Nations</emphasis>by Adam Smith,     <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Federal Antitrust Policy</emphasis>by Hans Thorelli, biographies of     Louis Brandeis, John D. Rockefeller, and piles of works by obscure     scholars and thinkers. For Lynn, these weren't just books. They were the     intellectual foundation of the entire anti-monopoly movement, the source     material for his life's work. And tonight, that life's work was the reason     he was out of a job-and boxing up his library.</p><p>Two months earlier during that summer of 2017, Lynn had made     public remarks about Google, a firm he viewed as an example of just the     kind of modern-day monopoly he was trying to disassemble. The comments had     caused Google's top executive, a major New America donor, to complain to     the think tank's president. Within days, Lynn was out, though he was     permitted to remain in his office to get his affairs in order. But that     would change the next morning, he knew, when the<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times,</emphasis>     acting on information Lynn himself had provided, would detail the     circumstances of his departure and put New America at the center of an     embarrassing scandal.</p><p>At the time, concerns about monopolies were elbowing their way     back onto Washington's agenda after decades in the wilderness. Lynn had     secured new funding, expanded his staff, and advised a growing roster of     lawmakers. Would he have to start again? On the ride home, he worried     about the future. How would his financial backers respond to the     <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> story? Would congressional aides still seek his team's     input? Or would all this momentum slip away?</p><p>In retrospect, the blowback about corporate influence on a     supposedly independent think tank probably helped bring new attention to     the very point Lynn had spent years making. Two years later, the question     of how to address the awesome powers of Big Tech has emerged as a     signature issue of our time-a formerly sleepy cause that looks likely to     turbocharge Washington's vast lobbying industry as corporations and their     critics spend big new dollars trying to sway legislators and     policymakers.</p><p>They've got a lot to lose. Google and Facebook control websites     that receive 70 percent of all internet traffic, Amazon accounts for     nearly half of online retail sales in the United States, and, taken     together, these three Silicon Valley empires collect more than two-thirds     of all digital-advertising spending. In a polarized Washington, hating on     Big Tech is an impulse that knows no party. Presidential candidates such     as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have demanded that Facebook be     broken up. Conservative media stars including Tucker Carlson and Sean     Hannity have blasted the platforms for what they view as censorship of     right-wing opinion. In 2017, the Trump administration launched an     ultimately unsuccessful effort to block AT&amp;T's $85-billion merger with     Time Warner. While Trump's contempt for CNN-a Time Warner subsidiary-may     have motivated his opposition, he framed it to appeal to the public's new     suspicions. \"It's too much concentration of power,\" Trump said of the     merger, \"in the hands of too few.\"\u00a0</p><p>Did the city suddenly wake up and smell the monopolistic     coffee? Not exactly. The story of how antitrust-the cause that evokes     Teddy Roosevelt-made it into the headlines of 21st-century America is more     interesting. At its center is Lynn, a 58-year-old journalist turned public     intellectual with a chip on his shoulder. \"He's part Southern gentleman,\"     says former New America colleague Sascha Meinrath, \"part cranky bastard.\"     Inspired by the progressive-era reformers who took down US Steel, Lynn     argues that only by reviving a lost tradition of antitrust enforcement can     we unwind the corporate monopolies that have divided the country into     haves and have-nots, captured our political system, and imperiled our     democracy. According to Felicia Wong, CEO of the liberal Roosevelt     Institute, Lynn is the \"Paul Revere\" of the modern anti-monopoly     movement.</p><p>But before Lynn's ideas could reach lawmakers, they had to     break through the intellectual cartel that controls the market for policy     solutions in Washington. \"Nobody would pay attention to us before,\" says     Lynn's longtime collaborator and fellow journalist Phil Longman, \"because     we didn't have a PhD after our names.\" Now, however, Lynn and his unlikely     band of reporters, lawyers, ex-political operatives, and Twitter warriors     have become the central nervous system for the most serious challenge to     corporate power in a generation.</p><p>\"It's amazing to see that the conversation has just so     completely changed,\" says Leah Douglas, a former policy analyst on Lynn's     team. \"Every time I get a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> alert that's like,     'Google and Facebook facing further antitrust scrutiny,' I'm just like, 'I     remember when that was on the whiteboard as a dream.' \"</p><p>Lynn grew up in a working-class section of Miami, in a house     where his brother, an automobile fanatic, kept V8 engines and junked cars     out in the front yard. As a boy, Lynn watched his father, who'd spent his     own childhood in a sharecropping family picking strawberries, slink to     work each morning to the insurance office he despised until the day he was     finally fired. Lynn's father eventually teamed up with his next-door     neighbor, a former Greyhound bus mechanic, on a roofing business. Lynn saw     how the career change instantly rejuvenated his dad, how much satisfaction     he found in humping rolls of tar paper up ladders and pushing his mower     through the Florida heat, sometimes with Lynn's help. He developed an     appreciation for the way mom-and-pop entrepreneurs could take control of     their own lives.</p><p>\"My dad was just like, 'I'm going to go do it for my own damned     self,' \" Lynn says. \"But then he was actually able to do that. There was     this space for that.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Lynn was eager to escape his scrappy community:     \"My motivation was get the hell out of Miami by whatever means possible.\"     In 1979, he moved to New York and enrolled at Columbia with financial aid.     He saved money and spent half a year traveling in India after graduation.     A few years later, he and his college sweetheart turned wife moved to     Latin America.</p><p>Within six months of going to work for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Daily Journal,</emphasis> an English-language newspaper in Caracas, Lynn landed in the     middle of his first high-stakes battle with authority. He and some     colleagues had written to management suggesting ways to improve the     paper's journalism-a move the bosses saw as an attempt to unionize. In the     hopes of squelching it, they fired the most junior staffer: Lynn. He found     a new job but continued to help his onetime coworkers as they fought for,     and eventually secured, formal union protections. It was a lesson that     would later prove useful. \"You understand,\" he says, \"how it is that     people actually create real power when they don't really have     power.\"\u00a0</p><p>In 1992, Lynn and his wife moved to Washington, where he became     editor of a glossy magazine called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Business</emphasis>. His worldview     would be rocked by an unlikely event 7,800 miles away. In 1999, a     7.6-magnitude earthquake leveled central Taiwan, claiming nearly 2,500     lives and destroying thousands of buildings. Lynn was puzzled to learn     that the economic damage quickly spread to the US, where computer     production plants in Texas and California shut down. When he investigated     the connection, he discovered that the earthquake had blocked the export     of semiconductors from an industrial town on Taiwan's west coast. It was     an aha moment: The international supply chain was so consolidated that     problems in a single Asian outpost could grind an entire industry to a     halt.</p><p>\"So then I ask,\" he recalls, \" 'How is it that things became so     concentrated?' \"</p><p>The question turned into his animating pursuit, which he     explored in two books. Researching them, he discovered America's lost     tradition of antitrust enforcement.</p><p>Beginning in the mid-19th century, robber barons like John     Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan used monopoly force to shake down smaller     competitors, buy politicians, and abuse employees. Awful working     conditions and massive inequality led to uprisings on farms and in     factories. Reformers responded by championing new laws, such as the     Sherman Antitrust Act, and new agencies, such as the Federal Trade     Commission, to restrain monopoly power. Today we remember them as efforts     to keep big cartels from ripping off consumers. But according to Tim Wu's     book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curse of Bigness,</emphasis> the goal wasn't simply to protect     prices at the checkout counter. It was to preserve competitive markets     and, more broadly, block unfair power anywhere in the economy or political     system. Bigness itself was viewed with suspicion. \"We may have democracy     or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few,\" said Supreme     Court justice Louis Brandeis, \"but we can't have both.\"\u00a0</p><p>Throughout much of the 20th century, regulators in Washington     enforced this philosophy aggressively. The feds didn't just target the big     fish, like Standard Oil or AT&amp;T. As recently as the 1960s, Federal     Trade Commission officials were so concerned about corporate consolidation     that they sued-successfully-to block a merger of two Los Angeles grocery     chains because the deal would have given the combined company a     7.5-percent share of the local market.</p><p>Everything changed in 1978, when a libertarian law professor     and Nixon-administration alum named Robert Bork published his seminal     work, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Antitrust Paradox,</emphasis> arguing that economic efficiency-as     opposed to protecting competition in the marketplace-was the true goal of     America's antitrust statutes. In the view of Bork, who became a household     name when the Senate blocked his Supreme Court nomination a decade later,     corporate mergers and even monopolies were typically dangerous only when     they harmed \"consumer welfare\"-a position that came to be interpreted as     triggering higher prices.</p><p>Politicians of both parties embraced the argument, all eager     for ways to extract the economy from its 1970s malaise. But its more     profound influence was on the courts. Judges began using price effects as     the determining factor when ruling on whether a merger could go forward.     If a merger resulted in higher costs for customers, it was bad. If it     lowered prices, no problem.</p><p>With remarkable speed, \"efficiency\" became the rudder of     antitrust policy and quietly ushered in a merger-friendly environment that     has lasted nearly 40 years.\u00a0</p><p>The more Lynn learned, the more radicalized he became. The     merger-and-acquisition bonanza-think Exxon's purchase of Mobil, Citicorp's     union with Travelers-was, he came to believe, responsible for much more     than problems in supply chains. Unchecked consolidation had created the     enormous conglomerates that had killed off local stores and hollowed out     small towns. These same behemoths had used their financial muscle to     control the political process, and they'd deployed their economic power in     ways that produced dangerous inequalities. Worst of all, Lynn argued, they     had turned America into a place where a laid-off insurance salesman, such     as his father, could hardly hope to support his family by striking out on     his own.</p><p>\"If you just take off these lenses that Robert Bork put on your     eyeballs,\" he says, \"you are going to see the world in a different way,     and you are going to see all these tools which you cannot see     now.\"</p><p>In 2010, Lynn launched a program at New America, later dubbed     Open Markets, to focus on the issue. Rather than churning out white     papers, as most think-tank academics did, he and his small team used     journalism to tell stories of those harmed by concentrated power, building     off earlier work he'd done, such as a proposal in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harper's</emphasis> that     made \"The Case for Breaking Up Wal-Mart.\"</p><p>Lynn and his longtime colleague, Longman, weren't alone in     their pursuit-the American Antitrust Institute was also trying to slow     consolidation. Lynn, however, wanted to build a base for political change,     and his agenda wasn't exactly popular. Republicans and Democrats alike had     grown enthralled by economies of scale, which delivered not only market     efficiencies but campaign contributions. Raising funds for Open Markets     was a constant struggle. Without business-community support, he hustled up     financial help from a few smaller foundations while subsidizing his living     by writing articles for American Airlines' in-flight magazine. Top-tier     lawmakers refused to take his calls. Lynn and his team eventually lined up     meetings with former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and staff for     former Virginia senator Jim Webb. \"You see how far down the food chain we     had to go?\" Longman says. But even they wouldn't touch the     issue.</p><p>It was a lonely, demoralizing time. \"Sometimes you feel like     you are insane,\" Lynn recalls. \"Because you're walking around saying, 'I     see it. Don't you see it?' \"</p><p>The people he resented most, though, were the mainstream     economists. These ivory-tower academics, in his view, had been taken     hostage by their theoretical models, which simply couldn't account for the     ways concentrated corporate power affected the real world. Worse, they     refused to accept Lynn and his team as peers. \"We were excluded out of all     those circles for ideological reasons, for reasons of class and of     education and everything,\" Longman says. \"Academics-they just never want     to admit that journalists might know something they don't.\"</p><p>Still, Lynn was so desperate to persuade the experts that he     once barged into the office of Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph     Stiglitz while the Columbia professor was in the middle of a meeting with     a graduate student. \"I'd say, 'Oh, this is only going to take a minute,' \"     Lynn recalls, \"and I would not move for an hour.\"</p><p>While pressing his case, Lynn refused to acknowledge the polite     hints that it might be time to leave. Stiglitz's assistant began sending     phone calls through to the professor, and the confused graduate student     hovered impatiently nearby. Finally, an aide carrying a tuxedo dashed into     the office and yelled to Stiglitz: \"You need to be in the car in five     minutes! And before that, you need to be in this!\"</p><p>In the end, Stiglitz-like so many others-seemed unmoved by     Lynn's appeal.\u00a0</p><p>One morning in 2012, Longman was reading the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> on     his bus ride to work when he spotted an article and just about fell out of     his seat. Right there, on the Gray Lady's op-ed page, was the Nobel     laureate and star liberal columnist Paul Krugman citing Longman and Lynn's     work in a column about why wages remained down even as corporate profits     were hitting record highs.</p><p>While Lynn and Longman had struggled for years to win converts     \"one soul, one mind at a time,\" as Lynn puts it, the endorsement of     Krugman-whose day job, after all, was as a Princeton professor-was the     first in a series of events that finally brought mainstream attention to     the issue. The<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Economist</emphasis> magazine proceeded to advocate for     stronger antitrust enforcement in a cover story, President Obama's Council     of Economic Advisors published research on industry consolidation, and the     Democratic Party reinserted antitrust into its official platform in 2016.     Then came the big shock: Trump's election. The revelations about the     Kremlin hijacking Big Tech platforms enraged the left, of course. But     there was also a more subtle takeaway: The results were interpreted as a     rejection of the technocratic class represented by Hillary Clinton-the     stratum Lynn found himself blackballed by.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that Lynn's onetime staffer Lina     Khan delivered the big breakthrough. Khan had joined Open Markets as a     recent college grad with no prior interest or experience in antitrust. But     after a crash course with Lynn, she began writing about consolidation in     the airline, chicken, and chocolate industries, and she later enrolled in     Yale Law School-where Bork himself once taught. In a 2017 article for the     school's legal journal called \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" she argued     that the current approach to antitrust policy simply failed to address the     ways a company like Amazon-which actually lowers prices to consumers-could     use its immense power to harm the economy. As an example, Khan noted that     the e-commerce giant could keep prices artificially low in order to drive     smaller competitors into the ground-a strategy that was once viewed as an     illegal form of \"predatory pricing.\"</p><p>The article exploded inside academic circles, made Lynn's     former employee an overnight star, and intensified calls to break up Big     Tech. But as Lynn's ideas gained traction, he and his allies took     criticism from all quarters. Conservatives such as Joshua Wright, of     George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, derided the movement     as \"Hipster Antitrust.\" Moderate Democrats, too, dismissed the approach as     dangerously radical. Broadly speaking, says University of Pennsylvania     professor Herbert Hovenkamp, a leading antitrust scholar, Lynn's approach     would use the antitrust framework to tackle more political concerns-such     as corporate influence of Congress-that it simply isn't designed to     address. \"Antitrust,\" Hovenkamp says, \"is not a fix-all for all of the     world's problems.\"</p><p>Behind the scenes, Lynn was facing more perilous enemies: the     corporations he has spent the past 15 years attacking. After the     publication of his second book, Lynn was subpoenaed as a witness in an     antitrust case involving a company he'd criticized. As a result, he had to     dip into his savings to pay for a lawyer and deal with the process servers     loitering outside his house. \"It was just really creepy,\" says Lynn's     wife, Anya Schoolman. \"For a long time, when there were people sitting in     vans in front of our house, I would take pictures of license plates. So     you feel a lot of that pressure.\"</p><p>Finally, in 2017, the animosity spilled into public view. That     summer, Lynn released a statement celebrating the $2.7-billion penalty     that European antitrust officials had imposed on Google. His remarks upset     Google's Eric Schmidt, who until the previous year had been New America's     chairman. In the ensuing ruckus, Lynn lost his job but became, at least in     some circles, a household name.</p><p>The day after the split went public, Open Markets-operating out     of a WeWork-relaunched as an independent organization.</p><p>Over the following months, news events helped generate     additional momentum for the group's agenda. In March 2018, the press     revealed that a consulting firm used by Trump's presidential campaign,     Cambridge Analytica, had improperly scraped personal data from more than     50 million Facebook users-turning the growing suspicion of Silicon Valley     into a full-blown backlash. Congress tuned in, and suddenly Open Markets     emerged as Washington's go-to destination for policymakers, staffers, and     academics looking to educate themselves on the monopoly problems     associated with Big Tech. As Sarah Miller, the program's deputy director,     says, \"We cannot keep up with the incoming requests.\"</p><p>Lynn's team has met with the staffs of a slate of 2020     presidential contenders, including Warren and Sanders, New Jersey senator     Cory Booker, and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar. \"A lot of lobbying firms     would kill for the kind of access we have,\" Longman says. Both Lynn and     Lina Khan discussed antitrust issues with Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes     before he published his 5,000-word manifesto in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times,</emphasis> calling for the social-networking giant's breakup. And     lawmakers from New York state-including congresswoman Alexandria     Ocasio-Cortez-got assistance from Open Markets in their ultimately     successful campaign to keep Amazon's HQ2 out of the Big Apple.</p><p>Lynn is influencing the debate over Big Tech in other ways as     well. Early Facebook investor and Silicon Valley stalwart Roger McNamee     credits Lynn for opening his eyes to potential antitrust solutions to     Silicon Valley problems. McNamee argues that Facebook should be     disassembled, and after publishing his book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Zucked,</emphasis> he's a     regular presence in Washington, meeting with regulators and lawmakers     about the company's dangers. Meanwhile, Khan, the former Open Markets     staffer, is now a lawyer for the Democrats on the House's antitrust     subcommittee, chaired by David Cicilline-a Democrat from Rhode Island who     just launched the congressional investigation to determine whether Big     Tech companies have violated antitrust statutes.\u00a0</p><p>As the 2020 election approaches, lawmakers and politicians     looking to curry favor with populists will push various proposals to rein     in Big Tech. Lynn himself won't be in front of the cameras, but his     influence will certainly be felt behind closed doors. Matt Stoller, a     fellow at Open Markets, says he's come to see Lynn's impact on     Washington's Big Tech debate as similar to the way the Velvet Underground     shaped rock music. \"The Velvet Underground was never very popular,\"     Stoller says, \"but everybody who was a fan started [their own]     band.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Open Markets Institute founder Barry Lynn (front center) and his team have collaborated with 2020 contender Elizabeth Warren and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes, who wants the tech giant broken up.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph by Jeff Elkins</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Monopoly issues are now a source of bipartisan distress.

This year, on CNBC, he informatively announced his role model: \"The European Union is suing them all of the time. Well, we should be doing this. They're our companies.\"</p><p>You will not be surprised to hear that Fox News talker Tucker Carlson agrees with Trump. But you might blink when told that he arrived at this agreement via a lecture delivered by Professor Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator has gained traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field by announcing pre-election antitrust verdicts to bust up Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook--no legal proceedings required.</p><p>Carlson sprinkles conservative holy water upon Warren's Plan for Economic Patriotism, saying her \"policy prescriptions make obvious sense.\" Warren would treat the rise of big tech firms like an exploding offshore oil rig: an emergency to be met by capping, closing, and hosing down the fiery mess. Carlson gushes that Warren \"sounds like Trump at his best.\"</p><p>This bipartisan pot of pols and pundits is echoing a school of thought known as the \"new structuralism.\" But you're more likely to hear its nickname: \"hipster antitrust.\" It claims a historical hero in the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, and its manifesto is Lina Khan's 2017 Yale Law Journal article \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\"</p><p>The antitrust hipsters fear the \"winner take all\" rivalry in tech platforms while romanticizing the drowsy world of \"common carrier\" regulation. As seen in transport and communications, this regime has had its unfortunate place in history. While imposing so-called \"nondiscrimination\" rules on service providers under the auspices of giving everyone equal access, the regulations widely and deeply favor incumbents and legacy technologies at the expense of upstarts and innovation.</p><p>In the hipsters' telling, regulation and antitrust are princes riding white horses to our salvation. The computer company IBM was an unrepentant oligopolist, they say, until it was put on the straight and narrow by a federal antitrust suit in 1969. That police action opened the market for Microsoft, which then started monopolizing the software business. Thankfully, the 1998 U.S. v. Microsoft suit busted that diabolical plot. If not for this victory for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, Google would have been nipped in the bud. Alas, Google's search function then got much too popular, and now it must be disciplined. Indeed, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple have all grown too big for their britches. Each needs to be split up. They would already have been, in fact, had the cop on the beat not dozed off.</p><p>This pattern-recognition exercise is a reprise of Justice Brandeis' early 20th century legal attacks on price-slashing innovators such as A&amp;P, Safeway, Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J.C. Penney. Then, as now, each triggering offense was a daring market breakthrough that consumers flocked to embrace. Legislation procured by those who, like Brandeis, saw these commercial successes as threats did more to promote cartels than to promote competition: Oligopolies flourished under the auspices of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with grim effects. Under the rule of the CAB, for example, air carrier competition was drastically reduced. In one of the \"most bizarre and illuminating chapters in the history of regulation,\" Harvard law professor Louis Jaffe wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 1954, only 30 percent of air traffic could be sold at coach fares--and that discounting existed only because \"unscheduled\" airlines brazenly evaded a government ban. \"The CAB is completely committed to the existing certificated carriers,\" Jaffe explained.</p><p>And while the ICC brought stability to railroads, it did so while creating higher average prices. The agency, which was established in 1887, was abolished in 1995 for undermining railroad and trucking efficiencies, wasting fuel, savaging the environment, killing economic growth, and waterboarding consumers. With less \"public interest\" and more open market rivalry, shipping costs were slashed, pollution declined, and innovation sprouted. A Brookings Institution study pegged efficiencies at $18 billion in 1996 alone, while crediting deregulation for allowing the emergence of new competitors in overnight shipping, including Federal Express.</p><p>Waves of deregulation produced protean results elsewhere, too. Legacy markets have been disrupted and powerful incumbents have fallen, with the choices available to consumers proliferating. The emergence of competitive wireless networks--granting 6 billion human beings access to global communications, 5 billion of them new phone subscribers--is itself a prime example of this liberalization. The antitrust hipsters present themselves as populists, but it is a curiously elitist form of populism that would undo the laws that allowed those mass market gains.</p><p>Antitrust was recently pushed to advance consumers' welfare. That was part of the liberalization trend. Now it's being tugged back to form a support system protecting \"competitors\"--guarding against low prices, escalating quality, and market rivalry.</p><p>AMAZON CRIME</p><p>FOR KHAN, A legal scholar currently based at Columbia University, the problem with today's market is epitomized by the operations of one firm. Amazon \"generates meager profits,\" electing to keep prices low while \"choosing to expand at a speed and scale that is pushing it into the red,\" she writes. It has risen to become the world's second most valuable firm, worth about $1 trillion, because it is \"at the center of e-commerce\" and owns \"essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it.\"</p><p>That infrastructure--a platform spanning the planet--certainly is valuable. Amazon lists more than 400 million product pages from more than 300,000 independent vendors, creating the \"long tail\" of niche goods and services that shoppers adore. Recode reported in 2018 that \"more than 100 million items in the U.S. are now eligible for two-day shipping.\" Most of these are sold by companies other than Amazon, which not only hosts \"rival\" vendors but takes orders, ships products, and collects payments on their behalf. About half of these businesses generate over $100,000 a year.</p><p>For Khan, Amazon creates competition but also crushes competition. It is ensnared in a maze of conflicts, she says, and it routinely engages in predatory tactics--such as favoring its own listings--that steamroll pesky upstarts to protect Amazon's ruthless march to world domination. Yet Amazon's prices have been low for 25 years now. Khan doesn't deny that. In fact, it's what she complains about: The company's offerings are too good for other sellers to compete with.</p><p>There is a germ of truth in Khan's complaints about Amazon's conflicts, but she fails to see the ubiquity of conflicts in economic rivalry--and in government regulation, which can worsen outcomes for consumers and the overall economy. Hence, she interprets vertical integration--Amazon supplying an online store and then stocking some of the shelves with its own products--in a naive and counterproductive way.</p><p>Every business acquires inputs and then sells outputs. In between, some magical process creates new value. Cooperative deals between suppliers and buyers today may well erupt in rivalrous tension tomorrow. That's actually a good thing: We want to encourage shifting alliances. Customers change; technologies advance; firms learn; efficiencies evolve. Amazon hosting its retail rivals is no weirder than Costco displaying its own Kirkland champagne side-by-side with Veuve Clicquot or the Dodgers hosting the Giants in Dodger Stadium.</p><p>Antitrust scribblers may imagine Amazon squelching independent sellers and stealing their profits, but that's not the reality according to the vendors. Hundreds of thousands of third-party sellers have made Amazon \"the Everything Store.\" From 1999 to 2018, Amazon's own share of the products it sells dropped from 97 percent to 42 percent. And even that overstates Amazon's vertical integration. Marketplace--the platform for third parties who offer goods through Amazon--now accounts for 68 percent of the platform's retail revenues.</p><p>\"More buyers transacting more often on Amazon will naturally attract third-party sellers,\" eMarketer analyst Andrew Lipsman told TechCrunch last year. \"But because third-party transactions are also more profitable, Amazon has every incentive to make the process as seamless as possible for those selling on the platform.\" In May 2019, Business Insider headlined the news \"3rd-party sellers are thriving on Amazon.\"</p><p>In Khan's telling, all the economic forces move in opposite fashion. She recommends a ban on mergers and more aggressive actions to limit or scale back the platform.</p><p>Take Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Khan blasted the combination in a June 2017 New York Times op-ed titled \"Amazon Bites Off Even More Monopoly Power.\" The fear was that a company with 0.8 percent of U.S. grocery sales (Amazon) gobbling up a competitor with 1.7 percent (Whole Foods) would leave American shoppers powerless to resist. Walmart's 26 percent share of total grocery sales, not to mention Kroger's 10 percent or Albertson's 5 percent, would not constrain the beast. Neither would the fact that, in the year the merger went through, just 3.8 percent of U.S. groceries were sold online.</p><p>\"Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will expand its dominance and heighten conflicts of interest,\" Khan predicted. \"By bundling services and integrating grocery stores into its logistics network, the company will be able to shut out or disfavor rival grocers and food delivery services.\"</p><p>Her predictions have thus far proven wrong: Amazon's rivals gained after the merger. \"In the past year,\" the Harvard Business Review reported in April 2019, \"Walmart, Kroger, Costco, and Target have driven down costs and introduced delivery capabilities in new regions, cutting into Amazon's market share.\" They're afraid of the online retail giant? Good.</p><p>The rivals' fortunes may still change. Who knows? Not Khan, not the Justice Department, not Amazon. Absent demonstrable harm, letting things play out produces robust competition, oodles of innovation, and even new competitors, such as Instacart, launched in 2012 by a former Amazonian. That company boasts that it delivers alcoholic beverages to your home in as little as one hour. Which is, of course, not a moment too soon.</p><p>Khan ignores these dynamics. Or rather, she actively opposes them.</p><p>Conventional wisdom holds that U.S. corporations are painfully shortsighted. It's said they scurry about with an eye to quarterly earnings while ignoring the broader horizon. It's said that this undermines the risk-taking and R&amp;D investments that are needed to unlock better worlds. But Khan launches her 96-page essay with this quote from The New York Times: \"Even as Amazon became one of the largest retailers in the country, it never seemed interested in charging enough to make a profit. Customers celebrated and the competition languished.\" She also quotes the biographer Ida Tarbell, who said that one of John D. Rockefeller's \"most impressive characteristics [was] patience.\"</p><p>THE FABLE OF THE DIAPERS</p><p>BACK IN THE day, Khan argues, antitrust policy would have stopped the clear and present danger of Amazon. But free market economists, mostly from the University of Chicago, have twisted the law to focus solely on \"consumer welfare\" as measured by \"prices and outputs.\" And so, she says, monopolies thrive. Things that look to be amazing new efficiencies, driven by economies of scale, are a trick: Predatory tactics displace competitors, steal markets, and dominate entire industries in the long run.</p><p>The paradigmatic illustration is Amazon's acquisition nine years ago of Diapers.com. Yet a close look at her selected case study undercuts the lessons taught in Lina Khan's academy.</p><p>In short: Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara launched the online retailer Quidsi in 2005. The startup sold baby products online, and its Diapers.com website gained a toehold. In November 2010, the pair sold their company to Amazon. Khan claims that Amazon actually squished them like a bug, using its massive data intelligence capabilities to crack their strategy. By figuring out how to reduce its own diaper prices, it drove Quidsi to the financial brink and then devoured it via merger in order to eliminate a retail rival. The upstart was vanquished, the monopolist got fatter, and all potential challengers were forewarned.</p><p>Khan's story is sourced from Brad Stone's 2013 book The Everything Store. Stone reports, but Khan does not, that the story of Amazon's strategy is in dispute. This missing detail is one among many. But it turns out to be a harmless oversight, because Khan's own facts, nested in the context of competitive innovation, are indisputably hostile to her theory.</p><p>First, there was no barrier to entry. Quidsi got into the business of selling Pampers and Huggies online, which Amazon could not prevent. The newcomer then pioneered innovative methods, particularly in shipping, using boxes that fit orders exactly so as to lower costs. This welcome progress stands in stark contrast to what happens under \"public utility\" regimes in which \"licenses of convenience and necessity\" are routinely denied to upstarts. Airlines, railroads, medical services, trucking, shipping, broadcasting, telecommunications, energy--in every one of these cases, commissions have erected artificial entry barriers deterring competition. Not a single new trunk airline was approved for launch by the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1938 to 1978. With unregulated diapers sold online, two guys from New Jersey formed a firm and walked right in.</p><p>Second, the Jersey boys did a better job of cleaning up the babies' bottoms. Yes, Amazon sells competing products, and yes, it has bots that relentlessly monitor competitive offers. But by 2010, Diapers.com was outselling the ogre from Seattle by about four to one. When Lore and Bharara sold to Amazon, they received a payoff of $545 million, or about $400 million above invested capital. If Amazon is a predator trying to discourage entrants, it is going to need some powerful corporate messaging to overcome the language its cash is speaking.</p><p>Third, founder Marc Lore didn't lose his entrepreneurial bent. In 2014, he founded Jet.com, an online retailer and direct rival to Amazon. In 2016, he sold that start-up for $3.3 billion to Walmart. Lore--a billionaire who bought a $43 million flat in one of New York City's finest buildings in 2018--now heads the brick-and-mortar retailer's eCommerce division. If this is what Amazon's economic brutality looks like, quick--let's crowdfund AdultDiapers.com and get pummeled.</p><p>Fourth, the gains for consumers were not just temporary. Khan says Amazon immediately ceased its price discounts on products sold by Diapers.com after absorbing the site. But hers is a vague and selective presentation; suffice it to say that the evidence would not be admissible in a court of law. I do not have a dataset as extensive as Amazon's, but online prices for many brands over time can be found on Google. Huggies, Snuggles, Pampers, Luvs, and Seventh Generations were about 18 percent cheaper in online stores (free delivery with minimum purchase!) in 2019 than they were in mid-2010. Mommies and daddies clicked away--and won. No predatory exclusion, no monopoly, no price hikes to recoup the investment. Just good, clean, bottom-up consumer welfare.</p><p>Finally, Khan makes a major concession when she argues (uncompellingly) that prices rose after the Amazon-Quidsi merger. Throughout her critique of modern antitrust, she complains about the fact that the law focuses \"primarily on price and output effects as metrics of competition.\" But there's a good reason for that, and courts ought to be encouraged to do more of it. These are the indices that impact customers and distinguish efficient rivalry from predatory conduct. Under the latter, prices fall, but only temporarily, and the price increases that come after wipe out the benefits for customers.</p><p>So Khan was right to consider Pampers prices as a metric of consumer impact. Alas, she makes no serious commitment to this approach. If she did, she would have to demand that regulatory measures advance their stated purpose and that they do not sabotage the constituency being offered protection. Attacking low prices with antitrust rules that retard innovation and freeze technologies does exactly that.</p><p>Even more problematic: As 1 witnessed up close while testifying as an economic expert retained by the winning side in a class-action suit against a firm found to have engaged in predation, judges can be lost when it comes to what remedies to administer.</p><p>\"For much of its history,\" write scholars Joshua Wright, Elyse Dorsey, Jonathan Klick, and Jan M. Rybnicek, \"antitrust has done more harm than good.\" Rulings that block pro-competitive conduct may \"have resounding chilling effects... likely to discourage other firms from engaging in similarly beneficial conduct.\" Leaving an overly dominant firm intact, on the other hand, often creates less social risk, because it generates its own offset: The profits earned by the miscreant announce opportunities for others.</p><p>Khan falls into this trap when she offers Quidsi as the quintessential upstart entrant but fails to mention its empirical reality. Or, for that matter, its inspiration: Amazon. Lore and Bharara idolized the online giant. They privately referred to Jeff Bezos as \"sensei\" and wanted to be him. And their decision to get into the game was funded by, among others, Accel Partners, a company flush with early-stage windfalls from Facebook. All these monopolies, so many startups.</p><p>BRANDEIS' FOLLY</p><p>THE ANTITRUST HIPSTERS' lodestar, Louis Brandeis, championed local enterprises--\"the small dealers and worthy men,\" as his Supreme Court predecessor Rufus Peckham called them--that found themselves fighting the emerging national chains. To Brandeis, the big retailers' low prices were a bug, not a feature. In 1915, the future justice amazed Rep. Alben Barkley (D-Ky.) by testifying that volume discounts were \"fraught with very great evil\" and should be banned. \"Knowing the quantity discounts were as old as business itself,\" wrote Thomas McCraw in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Prophets of Regulation (1984), Barkley \"could not believe he had heard Brandeis correctly.\" He had.</p><p>In this way of thinking, the efficiencies of the Industrial Revolution were a problem we needed government to counter. Brandeis condemned the consumer as \"servile, self-indulgent, indolent, ignorant,\" because she would blithely shop for lower prices and higher quality without concern for the social ramifications. It was an unambiguous loss, he believed, for A&amp;P to displace the local grocer and for Sears, Roebuck and Co. to outcompete the town dry goods shop. Brandeis supported cartels to raise prices and protect inefficient producers. He rejected the interests of the \"supine\" customer, who \"deserves to suffer\" for patronizing vendors based on cost and convenience. As McCraw put it, Brandeis attacked consumer welfare as an objective because \"consumers had betrayed him: They had refused to follow his precepts.\" Instead, they were eagerly buying \"the endless stream of goods that flowed\" from the large, integrated businesses that \"Brandeis so detested.\"</p><p>Brandeis' view nonetheless gained traction. In 1962, the Supreme Court blocked Brown Shoe (a company producing 4 percent of U.S. footwear) from merging with Kinney's (a company retailing 1.2 percent). The antitrust enforcers then put the kibosh on Vons-Shopping Bag in 1966, saving America from a supermarket behemoth that would have dominated the Los Angeles retail grocery market by cornering--as the third-largest local seller--7.5 percent of sales. That, the high court said, indicated a \"threatening trend toward concentration.\" One wonders what the justices were drinking, but that may have been answered a few days later, when the Court upheld the Department of Justice's move to stop a Pabst-Blatz merger as well.</p><p>Just to be clear: If the beer market were being monopolized, I would be the first to buy a case for the legal beagle filing suit. But here I'm not even opening a tab. As the Supreme Court explained: \"In 1958, the year of the merger, Pabst was the tenth largest brewer in the Nation and Blatz ranked eighteenth. The merger would have made Pabst the Nation's fifth largest brewer with 4.49% of the industry's total sales. By 1961, three years after the merger, Pabst had increased its share of the beer market to 5.83% and had become the third-largest brewer in the country.\" The Court ominously noted that their combined shares totaled 23.95 percent of the all-important Wisconsin beer market, raising the prospect of an \"incipient\" monopoly.</p><p>Justice William O. Douglas attached a 1966 Washington Post column, written by humorist Art Buchwald, as an appendix to his concurring opinion in the Pabst case. Buchwald's piece considered a future (1978) merger case involving the last two companies in America-Samson, controlling all corporate assets west of the Mississippi, and Delilah, owning everything to the east. The essay had the Court finding no competitive issue. An excellent analogy for Pabst-Blatz: After those two companies assume control of all but 94.17 percent of U.S. beer production, what's left?</p><p>BEWARE THE BIG FIX</p><p>ANTITRUST HIPSTERS PRESENT the free market economists of the University of Chicago as their historical villains. Yet these scholars began their journey not far from Brandeis. The late Nobel laureate George Stigler started as a \"bust 'em up\" guy: In 1952 he wrote an article in Fortune stating the \"case against Big Business\" and calling for the dissolution of General Motors. But through observation and analysis, Stigler's view progressed until he arrived at an antitrust policy that gave dynamic forces their due and put consumer interests at the center. He came to see government institutions as imperfect, and he posited in a 1971 paper the theory of \"regulatory capture,\" whereby \"regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.\"</p><p>Khan claims that ideological motives explain this \"effort to idealize competitive markets and assume that nonintervention was almost always superior to interference.\" Yet a deep and cutting critique of regulation preceded the new Chicago School approach. In 1952, Harvard's Samuel P. Huntington wrote in the Yale Law Journal that the \"attitude of the railroads towards the [Interstate Commerce] Commission since 1935 can only be described as one of satisfaction, approbation, and confidence.\" Huntington called for abolishing the agency, saying it had lost \"its objectivity and impartiality by becoming dependent upon the support of a single, narrow interest group\": the railroads.</p><p>Jaffe, writing in that 1954 Harvard Law Review article, similarly acknowledged that most regulators had underperformed. Drawing on the extensive writings of former Harvard Law School Dean James Landis, Jaffe noted that administrative supervision of industry was the dream of the Progressive Era and then of the New Deal. But the \"planning thesis took almost no account of the character and psychology of our administrators\" and \"gave too little weight to the dynamism of the industrial system.\"</p><p>Cleaning up the regulatory mess fell, in part, to a Cornell economist: the late Alfred Kahn, an earnest New Dealer for all of his days. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977, Kahn intended to reform the agency. But he found that greater price competition, not to mention service innovation, could not be realized within the model he inherited. Kahn discovered deregulation not by imbibing Chicago School Kool-Aid but through fealty to the public's actual interests. It was because he took his fiduciary obligations seriously that he sought to overturn the \"common carrier\" approach of the 1938 Air Carriers Act, ultimately ending the agency via bipartisan congressional reform.</p><p>Kahn's early scholarly work channeled Thorsten Veblen, who was as critical of consumers' choices as Brandeis was. Yet Kahn studied on. He came to see \"that society's choices are always between or among imperfect systems\" but that markets generated a dynamism, giving them an edge: \"Wherever it seems likely to be effective, even very imperfect competition is preferable to regulation.\" Paring back controls over air routes and fares has resulted in consumer gains conservatively estimated by the Brookings Institution at $10 billion annually.</p><p>No, air travel is not perfect. Yes, I've flown United. But it's all relative. The Civil Aeronautics Board was a comparative disaster for efficiency, innovation, and customers--particularly the low- and middle-income Americans, then earthbound, who now dot the sky.</p><p>Policy makers gave the \"common carrier\" theory of regulation a marathon test drive following the 1934 Communications Act. The FCC, under its \"public interest, convenience, or necessity\" standard, enhanced Ma Bell's market power. That was, literally and practically, \"network neutrality\"--the same philosophy endorsed by Lina Khan as a promising pathway for regulating tech giants today.</p><p>How did it work out? In 1974, the U.S. Justice Department filed a massive antitrust suit against the company. Settled in 1982, it dissolved the giant into seven \"Baby Bells\" and an independent AT&amp;T Long Lines.</p><p>The reason for the lawsuit was that AT&amp;T, a \"common carrier,\" was preventing competition by using antidiscrimination rules enforced by the Federal Communications Commission. \"The FCC was trying to block MCI from competing in ordinary long-distance services when the AT&amp;T case was filed by the Department of Justice in 1974,\" explained Robert Crandall and Cliff Winston of the Brookings Institution in a 2003 Journal of Economic Perspectives article. \"Thus, antitrust policy did not triumph in this case over restrictive practices by a monopolist to block competition, but instead it overcame anticompetitive policies by a federal regulatory agency.\"</p><p>There is no secret formula that produces enormous gains from blockbuster innovation without the disruption of old markets and obsolete business models. The \"Great Enrichment\" that economist Deirdre McCloskey describes--an approximately 30-fold increase in capitalist country incomes between 1800 and 2000, which upended the economic flatline of history--was and is a rough-and-tumble process. That's why Joseph Schumpeter dubbed it \"creative destruction.\"</p><p>There are good reasons to be wary of large organizations of any stripe, including giant tech platforms. But far more dangerous--to consumers, workers, and the economy as a whole--are hipster antitrust promises of a magical fix.</p><p>THOMAS W. HAZLETT is Hugh H.
