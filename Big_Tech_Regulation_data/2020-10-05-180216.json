The case concerned web publishers embedding a Google-powered search engine on their site, and being prevented from letting third parties place search adverts at the top of search results. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said this \"denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition\". It takes the EC's total antitrust fines against Google to (EURO)8.2 billion in two years, following <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-vs-europe-antitrust-battle-timeline-major-milestones-3589424/\">previous findings</url> in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively about Google unfairly advantaging its Shopping service and Google Chrome browser. </p><p>The European Union is not the only one gunning for big tech. UK chancellor Philip Hammond <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/33214/chancellor-hammond-backs-calls-wane-tech-giants-market-power\">has hinted about</url> tightening digital competition policy following an independent report which raised concerns that the sector was anti-competitive. And US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">wants</url> the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/elizabeth-warren-break-up-amazon-google-facebook-socialism-capitalism\">broken up</url> to unleash a new wave of digital innovation. In an echo of the EC's Google findings, Warren cites various examples of these companies using their market dominance against smaller rivals - Amazon       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf\">creating</url> own-brand versions of goods being sold on its platform, for instance.   </p><p>I broadly agree with this growing movement. Yet my main concern hasn't come into focus - even though it's arguably the biggest threat these companies pose to the future. They are standing in the way of the next big digital revolution, and need to be reined in before it's too late. </p><h>The smart future</h><p>The first computing revolution started in the 1950s as mainframe computers slowly entered the workplace and began to automate basic back-office functions like payroll and accounts. The second revolution, in the 1980s-2000s, centred on the PC and the migration of computers to the desktop and then to our homes. Third came the mobile revolution, which put those computers in our pockets so we could take them wherever we went. </p><p>The next shift has started already. In our homes, smart assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home are steadily colonising personal spaces, along with the likes of smart lighting and security systems. Smart home devices <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS44361618\">shifted</url> some 640m units last year, and will be doing twice that by 2023. </p><p>Over the same period, we can also expect something like 50% growth in unit sales of wearable devices like fitness trackers and smart clothing - a huge market <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/idc-apple-led-wearables-market-in-2018-with-46-2m-of-the-total-172-2m-devices-shipped/\">for Apple</url> - to approaching 300m a year. As for the workplace, an equivalent flurry of sensor technology, underpinned by AI, is now transforming factories and production lines. Sometimes known as industry 4.0, the sector is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/10/17/1622652/0/en/Global-Industry-4-0-Market-Will-Reach-USD-155-30-Billion-By-2024-Zion-Market-Research.html\">forecast to</url> double to over US$150 billion by 2023,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4519307/industry-4-0-market-and-technologies-2018-2023\">and over</url> a trillion dollars by the early 2030s. </p><p>Hand in hand with this will be an explosion in smart services. Tech companies will increasingly seek to improve our lives by crunching sensor data from all this hardware, as well as from all the activities that we do on our phones. Alongside the tech giants, numerous start-ups are staking out territory in this frontier. </p><p>In the US, a company called <url normalizedValue=\"https://getnotion.com\">Notion</url> has raised US$16m towards smart home sensors to alert owners via a phone app about water leaks, intrusions and temperature fluctuations. British start-up McLear       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mclear.com/\">has launched</url> a smart ring which can electronically unlock doors and authenticate payments in retail outlets. If you look on start-up databases like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.beauhurst.com\">Beauhurst</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crunchbase.com\">Crunchbase</url>, you come across thousands of similar companies. </p><p>But if there is a rapidly growing ecosystem, there is a competitive imbalance. Just like Notion, many smart devices rely on smartphone apps as the interface through which users control them. With almost 3 billion smartphones in use globally, <url normalizedValue=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide\">almost</url> three quarters are Android devices, controlled by Google, and one quarter are iOS, controlled by Apple. </p><p>Apps distributed via these two gatekeepers' app stores must comply with their regulations. In many cases, the giants themselves will be competing in the same marketplace. We already knew that Apple was betting heavily on health-related wearables services, for instance; the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/apple-card-what-you-need-to-know-now-about-apples-new-credit-card-for-your-iphone/\">Apple credit card</url> announcement shows it also has finance in its sights. </p><p>Similarly, Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/28/amazon-buys-video-doorbell-ring-smart-home-delivery\">last year spent</url> US$1 billion on smart doorbell maker Ring. Type \"smart doorbell\" into Amazon's search box and, perhaps not surprisingly, its own products show up first. As innocent as this might be, one can imagine the temptation for such companies to give preference to their own devices and services when presenting search results. </p><h>There will be blood</h><p>Yet search is actually something of a side issue in all of this. Between them, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple hold detailed data on the interests, health, social connections and purchasing habits of billions of people. This data will be an essential input for the AI systems that will power the coming generation of smart services. This, therefore, is the greater threat to competition and innovation. </p><p>If \"data is the new oil\", as many <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@adeolaadesina/data-is-the-new-oil-2947ed8804f6\">have argued</url>, then the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/business/1999/12/23/standard-ogre\">US break-up</url> of Standard Oil in 1911 into 34 companies because of its dominance on oil production and supply is something we should be studying closely. Whether the answer is to break up some tech giants, force them to open up their data assets to new entrants, prevent them buying start-ups in this sector, or allow users more control over their personal data, this is a debate we should have urgently.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/20/hike-pressure-tech-giants-share-mapping-data-government-told/\">Calls</url> in the UK for big tech to make its mapping data freely available are almost certainly the shape of things to come. </p><p>The open nature of the internet over the past 20 years created an environment where innovation could flourish. It is vital that this continues, but legacy monopolies from the previous revolution threaten to slow the process down. Unless digital data is liberalised, smart services could still fall a long way short of their potential. As we saw with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whatcar.com/news/history-of-the-electric-car/n18063\">electric car</url> throughout the 20th century, vested interests are more than capable of impeding progress to keep their own business activities alive and well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Martin De Saulles does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-114262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRD-SG31-DXP7-13GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1095\"/><timeReceived>1:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

The case concerned web publishers embedding a Google-powered search engine on their site, and being prevented from letting third parties place search adverts at the top of search results. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said this 'denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition'. It takes the EC's total antitrust fines against Google to \u20ac8.2 billion in two years, following previous findings in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively about Google unfairly advantaging its Shopping service and Google Chrome browser. Elizabeth Warren: break-up call. </p><p>Kelly Bell The European Union is not the only one gunning for big tech. UK chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted about tightening digital competition policy following an independent report which raised concerns that the sector was anti-competitive. And US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook broken up to unleash a new wave of digital innovation. In an echo of the EC's Google findings, Warren cites various examples of these companies using their market dominance against smaller rivals - Amazon creating own-brand versions of goods being sold on its platform, for instance. I broadly agree with this growing movement. Yet my main concern hasn't come into focus - even though it's arguably the biggest threat these companies pose to the future. They are standing in the way of the next big digital revolution, and need to be reined in before it's too late. The smart future The first computing revolution started in the 1950s as mainframe computers slowly entered the workplace and began to automate basic back-office functions like payroll and accounts. The second revolution, in the 1980s-2000s, centred on the PC and the migration of computers to the desktop and then to our homes. Third came the mobile revolution, which put those computers in our pockets so we could take them wherever we went. The next shift has started already. In our homes, smart assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home are steadily colonising personal spaces, along with the likes of smart lighting and security systems. Smart home devices shifted some 640m units last year, and will be doing twice that by 2023. Over the same period, we can also expect something like 50% growth in unit sales of wearable devices like fitness trackers and smart clothing - a huge market for Apple - to approaching 300m a year. As for the workplace, an equivalent flurry of sensor technology, underpinned by AI, is now transforming factories and production lines. Sometimes known as industry 4.0, the sector is forecast to double to over US$150 billion by 2023, and over a trillion dollars by the early 2030s. From despair to wear. Kaspars Grinwalds Hand in hand with this will be an explosion in smart services. Tech companies will increasingly seek to improve our lives by crunching sensor data from all this hardware, as well as from all the activities that we do on our phones. Alongside the tech giants, numerous start-ups are staking out territory in this frontier. In the US, a company called Notion has raised US$16m towards smart home sensors to alert owners via a phone app about water leaks, intrusions and temperature fluctuations. British start-up McLear has launched a smart ring which can electronically unlock doors and authenticate payments in retail outlets. If you look on start-up databases like Beauhurst or Crunchbase , you come across thousands of similar companies. But if there is a rapidly growing ecosystem, there is a competitive imbalance. Just like Notion, many smart devices rely on smartphone apps as the interface through which users control them. With almost 3 billion smartphones in use globally, almost three quarters are Android devices, controlled by Google, and one quarter are iOS, controlled by Apple. Apps distributed via these two gatekeepers' app stores must comply with their regulations. In many cases, the giants themselves will be competing in the same marketplace. We already knew that Apple was betting heavily on health-related wearables services, for instance; the Apple credit card announcement shows it also has finance in its sights. Similarly, Amazon last year spent US$1 billion on smart doorbell maker Ring. Type 'smart doorbell' into Amazon's search box and, perhaps not surprisingly, its own products show up first. As innocent as this might be, one can imagine the temptation for such companies to give preference to their own devices and services when presenting search results. There will be blood Yet search is actually something of a side issue in all of this. Between them, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple hold detailed data on the interests, health, social connections and purchasing habits of billions of people. This data will be an essential input for the AI systems that will power the coming generation of smart services. This, therefore, is the greater threat to competition and innovation. Oil be darned. Wikimedia If 'data is the new oil', as many have argued , then the US break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 into 34 companies because of its dominance on oil production and supply is something we should be studying closely. Whether the answer is to break up some tech giants, force them to open up their data assets to new entrants, prevent them buying start-ups in this sector, or allow users more control over their personal data, this is a debate we should have urgently. Calls in the UK for big tech to make its mapping data freely available are almost certainly the shape of things to come. The open nature of the internet over the past 20 years created an environment where innovation could flourish. It is vital that this continues, but legacy monopolies from the previous revolution threaten to slow the process down. Unless digital data is liberalised, smart services could still fall a long way short of their potential. As we saw with the electric car throughout the 20th century, vested interests are more than capable of impeding progress to keep their own business activities alive and well.

They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law \"jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet\" that have been crucial to innovation for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country's biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and Amazonare a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.</p><p>The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like <person><nameText>Stephen K. Bannon, </nameText></person><person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>former chief strategist, as well as <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.</p><p>Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.</p><p>\"There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.</p><p>The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions. In the last year, Amazon has added antitrust to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies. Googlehas paid several outside lobbying firms to argue against the sex trafficking bill, according to recent federal filings.</p><p>\"We are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\" said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Amazon and other tech companies.</p><p>Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years. That is expected to continue, with regulators prepared to push a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes.</p><p>The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion. The  scrutiny grew after companies struggled to eliminate fake content from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage.</p><p>After <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>revealed to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies. He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters.</p><p>\"This is uncharted territory,\" Mr. Warner said in an interview. \"The growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\"</p><p>Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.</p><p>The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.</p><p>Companies like Googleand <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Googleand <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.</p><p>Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googlerealized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.</p><p>As of Tuesday, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googlewere still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Googlesaid the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.</p><p>Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.</p><p>\"We'll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\" Susan Molinari, Google's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>discussions with the lawmakers were private.</p><p>\"We strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\" Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said in a statement.</p><p>Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat. On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the mother of a teenage victim of trafficking.</p><p>The Senate invited <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googleto testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\" Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \"But selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\"</p><p>Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.</p><p>The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Googleand Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, recently fired a division of antitrust scholars who had been critical of the company. Googlehas denied playing a role in the split. In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast - their adversaries on many policy issues - to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules.</p><p>Even Amazon's recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon's deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>We need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now,\" said Ms. Klobuchar. \"Antitrust laws haven't been updated since the 1950s. In the 1950s, they didn't envision a major search engine dominating the internet. They didn't even have the internet.\"</p><p>Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005442366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHX-KDR1-JC85-N1N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law \u201cjeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet\u201d that have been crucial to innovation for decades.</p><p>By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.</p><p>The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.</p><p>The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.</p><p>Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.</p><p>\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.</p><p>The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions. In the last year, Amazon has <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=6FF70C79-F8BC-456F-9DFB-5F2F92B82706&amp;filingTypeID=60\">added antitrust</url> to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies. Google has paid several outside lobbying firms to argue       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=552691B3-657A-4E26-B57B-A8E2029A6C6D&amp;filingTypeID=60\">against the sex trafficking bill</url>, according to recent federal filings.</p><p>\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.</p><p>Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years. That is expected to continue, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/business/eu-tech-tax.html?_r=0\">regulators prepared</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/business/eu-tech-tax.html?_r=0\">to push</url> a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes.</p><p>The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/magazine/can-facebook-fix-its-own-worst-bug.html?mcubz=1&amp;mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=B92E13730D6AC6C9A7AB0EF7C79A7571&amp;gwt=pay\">scrutiny grew</url> after companies       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/facebook-russian-political-ads.html?mcubz=1\">struggled to eliminate fake content</url> from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/facebook-russian-political-ads.html?mcubz=1\">After Facebook revealed</url> to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/mark_r_warner/index.html?mcubz=1\">Senator Mark Warner</url>, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies. He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires Facebook and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters.</p><p>\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.</p><p>The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.</p><p>Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.</p><p>As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.</p><p>Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.</p><p>Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.</p><p>\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.</p><p>Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat. On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/09/slain_teens_mother_urges_passa.html\">mother of a teenage victim of trafficking</url>.</p><p>The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.</p><p>\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201d</p><p>Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.</p><p>The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Google and Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, <url normalizedValue=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html?referer=https://t.co/N8ZkfXHbqH?amp=1\">recently fired a division of antitrust scholars</url> who had been critical of the company. Google has denied playing a role in the split. In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast \u2014 their adversaries on many policy issues \u2014 to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules.</p><p>Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.</p><p>\u201cWe need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar. \u201cAntitrust laws haven\u2019t been updated since the 1950s. In the 1950s, they didn\u2019t envision a major search engine dominating the internet. They didn\u2019t even have the internet.\u201d</p><p>Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang.</p><p>PHOTO: Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, in Washington this month.

The U.S. Federal Election Commission is considering bringing in Facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing.</p><p>Unlike in Europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion-dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the United States, even as their market power continues to grow. Amazon (AMZN.O), for example, controls more than a third of U.S. online commerce, while Google and Facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the U.S. digital ad market.</p><p>Internet firms have from their inception urged U.S. politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. These firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama, which saw several officials go to work for Google upon leaving the White House.</p><p>But some Democrats, still bitter over Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry's power. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the \"wild, wild West\" and is working on legislation to require more disclosure.</p><p>On the Republican side, President Donald Trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. Google and Facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook.</p><p>Now, the Internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources.</p><p>\"Tech is no longer the golden goose,\" said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Maybe it's a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the Federal Trade Commission, remain severely understaffed.</p><p>But the shift in tone is palpable.</p><p>On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on Facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under U.S. law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads.</p><p>The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>The moves marked an about-face for Zuckerberg, who after the November election said it was a \"crazy idea\" to think that activity on Facebook swayed the vote.</p><p>Facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet.</p><p>But after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex-trafficking victim - which followed two big tech companies, Oracle (ORCL.N) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue - Facebook and Google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources.</p><p>In a statement, Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president of U.S. policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to \"address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.\"</p><p>The tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of Congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report \"terrorist\" activity to the government.</p><p>But the effort to amend Section 230 is seen as different. The fast progress of legislation, introduced in August, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked Congress.</p><p>The bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.</p><p>Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead architect of the Section 230 legislation, said in an interview with Reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without Silicon Valley's cooperation.</p><p>The bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the Senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Portman said he had met with Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, who expressed strong support.</p><p>\"Frankly, I am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,\" Portman said. \"It is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.\"</p><p>Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-100354836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJP-P001-F11P-X4XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Yerepouni Daily News.

The US Federal Election Commission is considering bringing in Facebookand other tech firms for a public hearing.<br/> Unlike in Europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion-dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the United States, even as their market power continues to grow. Amazon, for example, controls more than a third of US online commerce, while Googleand Facebookcombined account for more than sixty percent of the US digital ad market.<br/> Internet firms have from their inception urged US politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. These firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama, which saw several officials go to work for Googleupon leaving the White House.<br/> But some Democrats, still bitter over Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry's power. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the \"wild, wild West\" and is working on legislation to require more disclosure.<br/> On the Republican side, President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. Googleand Facebookhave been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook.<br/> Now, the Internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources.<br/> \"Tech is no longer the golden goose,\" said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Maybe it's a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.\"<br/> Silicon Valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the Federal Trade Commission, remain severely understaffed.<br/> But the shift in tone is palpable.<br/> On Thursday, FacebookChief Executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on Facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under US law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads.<br/> The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 US presidential election.<br/> The moves marked an about-face for Zuckerberg, who after the November election said it was a \"crazy idea\" to think that activity on Facebookswayed the vote.<br/>Facebookhas also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet.<br/> But after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex-trafficking victim - which followed two big tech companies, Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue - Facebookand Googlehave opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources.<br/> In a statement, Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president of US policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to \"address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.\"<br/>  The tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of Congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report \"terrorist\" activity to the government.<br/> But the effort to amend Section 230 is seen as different. The fast progress of legislation, introduced in August, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked Congress.<br/>  The bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.<br/>  Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead architect of the Section 230 legislation, said in an interview with Reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without Silicon Valley's cooperation.<br/>  The bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the Senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Portman said he had met with Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, who expressed strong support.<br/>  \"Frankly, I am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,\" Portman said. \"It is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Just last week, the U.S. Senate took a big step toward advancing legislation that would partially strip away the internet industry's bedrock legal protection, a 1996 law that shields companies from liability for the activities of their users. At the same time, Democratic senators are writing legislation that would create new disclosure rules for online political ads after Facebook this month revealed that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. </p><p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission is considering bringing in Facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing. Unlike in Europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion-dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the United States, even as their market power continues to grow. Amazon, for example, controls more than a third of U.S. online commerce, while Google and Facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the U.S. digital ad market. Internet firms have from their inception urged U.S. politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. These firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama, which saw several officials go to work for Google upon leaving the White House. But some Democrats, still bitter over Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry's power. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the 'wild, wild West' and is working on legislation to require more disclosure. On the Republican side, President Donald Trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. Google and Facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook. Now, the Internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources. 'Tech is no longer the golden goose,' said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'Maybe it's a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.' Silicon Valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the Federal Trade Commission, remain severely understaffed. But the shift in tone is palpable. On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on Facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under U.S. law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads. The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The moves marked an about-face for Zuckerberg, who after the November election said it was a 'crazy idea' to think that activity on Facebook swayed the vote. Facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet. But after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex-trafficking victim - which followed two big tech companies, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue - Facebook and Google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources. In a statement, Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president of U.S. policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to 'address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.' The tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of Congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report 'terrorist' activity to the government. But the effort to amend Section 230 is seen as different. The fast progress of legislation, introduced in August, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked Congress. The bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead architect of the Section 230 legislation, said in an interview with Reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without Silicon Valley's cooperation. The bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the Senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Portman said he had met with Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, who expressed strong support. 'Frankly, I am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,' Portman said. 'It is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR1079881506303058221251761700223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJN-RPX1-JCMN-Y20G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><timeReceived>1:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 25, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Usually, when you dig into the details, the attacks on the firms are a combination of general fear of \"bigness,\" hatred/jealousy of success and a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. Now, let's be clear: big companies with too much power do have a rather long history of bad behavior and companies should be watched carefully if they abuse their position. But the anti-internet populism seems incredibly misplaced, especially given that the companies they're attacking are often companies that have clearly improved the lives of those doing the attacking. I'm always worried about old \"enabling\" companies becoming the new gatekeepers[1], but I'm also confident in the ability of a brand new generation of enablers to undermine business models of the last generation of internet giants as well -- especially if they start making moves that actually harm the public. </p><p><br/> But, it seems, this general hatred of Silicon Valley is being taken to nearly parodic levels with two new articles, one in Salon and one in Slate, both of which call for \"nationalizing\" some of the internet's most popular companies. First up, we have Richard \"RJ\" Eskow saying that we should nationalize Amazon and Google[2] because the original internet was publicly funded, and thus, apparently, everything built after that should be owned by the federal government. Big Tech was created with publicly developed technology. No matter how they spin it, these corporations were not created in garages or by inventive entrepreneurs. The core technology behind them is the Internet, a publicly funded platform for which they pay no users' fee. In fact, they do everything they can to avoid paying their taxes. <br/> Big Tech's use of public technology means that it operates in a technological 'commons,' which they are using solely for its own gain, without regard for the public interest. Meanwhile the United States government devotes considerable taxpayer resource to protecting them \ufffd' from patent infringement, cyberterrorism and other external threats. Of course, based on this absolutely idiotic argument, you could argue that we should nationalize just about every business out there. Fedex and UPS? Why they make use of the federal highway system, which was publicly funded. So, \"no matter how they spin it,\" the \"core infrastructure\" behind them was \"publicly funded.\" Ditto for the entire US automobile industry (though, to be fair, we kinda came pretty close to \"nationalizing\" them a few years back). How about Wall Street? I mean, look at it: it's entirely dependent on federal currency. Clearly: should be nationalized. In fact, I'm having trouble coming up with a business that shouldn't be nationalized under these conditions. Almost every business relies on some aspect of publicly-funded infrastructure. <br/> From there, Eskow insists that these companies are \"abusive,\" which again is apparently a reason why they should be nationalized (he doesn't explain how the two are connected or why he believes nationalized companies would be less prone to abusive power -- because he can't). But he picks some rather unfortunate examples for \"abuse.\" The bluntness with which Big Tech firms abuse their monopoly power is striking. Googlehas said that it will soon begin blocking YouTube videos from popular artists like Radiohead and Adele unless independent record labels sign deals with its upcoming music streaming service (at what are presumably disadvantageous rates). Amazon's war on publishers like Hachette is another sign of Big Tech arrogance. Except, as we've detailed, neither of those stories is even remotely accurate. Artists are not being blocked[3] from YouTube, they're being offered a better deal if they want to monetize their videos. Some don't like the terms of that deal, but they can still upload their own videos, just not to the monetized services of YouTube. And the Amazon/Hachette example is not a \"war on publishers\" so much as it's an attempt to get better prices[4] for consumers. Apparently, Eskow would like to side with the publishers over the public. Why? <br/> Eskow also finds his \"support\" in odd places: Even Microsoft's Steve Ballmer argued that Googleis a 'monopoly' whose activities were 'worthy of discussion with competition authority.' He should know. Wait. A company that is being beat left and right by an upstart competitor is complaining that that competitor should be regulated? Gee, that means absolutely nothing. <br/> Nowhere in the entire piece does Eskow even attempt to explain how \"nationalizing\" these firms would actually solve any of these issues. He just insists it would. Apparently he's unaware of how \"wonderful\" service is from nationalized companies. I'm sure bureaucracies and government controls are just great for innovation. And, if we're talking about abuse, shall we bring up what happened with the history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were \"de facto nationalized?\" <br/> Eskow also goes on and on about the privacy violations of these companies, but for a deeper discussion on that, we'll flip over to Salon competitor Slate, where Philip Howard has an article about how we should nationalize Facebook[5] because of that company's long-standing problems on the privacy front: By 'nationalizing Facebook,' I mean public ownership and at least a majority share at first. When nationalizing the company restores the public trust, that controlling interest could be reduced. There are three very good reasons for this drastic step: It could fix the company's woeful privacy practices, allow the social network to fulfill its true potential for providing social good, and force it to put its valuable data to work on significant social problems. <br/> Let's start with privacy. Right now, the company violates everybody's privacy expectations, not to mention privacy laws[6]. It also struggles to respond properly to regulatory requests in different countries. In part, this is because its services are designed to meet the bare minimum of legal expectations in each jurisdiction. When users in Europe request copies of the data Facebook keeps on them, they are sent huge volumes of records[7]. But not every user lives in a jurisdiction that requires such responsiveness from Facebook\ufffd'U.S. users are out of luck because their regulators don't ask as many questions as those in the European Union[8] and Canada[9]. Privacy watchdogs consistently complain that the company uses user data in ways they didn't agree to or anticipate. There are suspicions that the company creates shadow profiles[10] of people who aren't even users but whose names get mentioned by people who are Facebook users. It's completely reasonable to question Facebook's privacy practices, and its history of arbitrarily changing things and being involved in \"creepy\" behavior. But, again, there's a massive leap in logic to go from \"hey, Facebook isn't very good at protecting your privacy\" to \"let's hand the company over the to US government.\" I don't know if Philip Howard has been living under a rock for the past 13 months or so, but if there's one organization that appears to respect your privacy even less than Facebook, it would be the US government. The very same US government that is actively looking for new ways to spy on as many people as possible. And Howard thinks the approach to \"protect\" users' privacy from Facebook is to... give all that info directly to the US government? <br/> In fact, Howard actually argues directly for how wonderful it would be for the US gov't to be able to snoop through our data to perform \"research\" on it: Nationalizing Facebook would allow more resources to go into data mining for public health and social research. Somehow, he claims that if the company were \"nationalized,\" then there would magically be higher ethical standards to make sure this research is \"good\" and not \"evil.\" He also has a funny notion whereby if Facebook were nationalized, not only would it be useful in tracking down bad people, but \"good\" activists that we liked could also be allowed to use pseudonyms, rather than real names. Because that's exactly what we want: the US government picking and choosing which activists are \"good.\" <br/> Having read both of these articles, I'm kind of wondering if they're both a form of satire, mocking the idea of nationalization or even the anti-internet populism we've been seeing lately -- but it looks as if they're both serious, if totally ridiculous.<br/>Permalink[11] |

These were:</p><p>- To require industry to pre-screen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children;</p><p>- To press the WeProtect Global Alliance - a group comprising 97 governments, 25 technology companies and 30 civil society organisations - to take more action internationally to ensure that those countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access to such imagery;</p><p>- To introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices, and;</p><p>- To publish, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the Online Harms White Paper.</p><p>The Government is currently working on new legislation around online harms, including placing a statutory duty of care on tech companies to keep their users safe, overseen by an independent regulator.</p><p>Earlier this month the UK joined the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in formally launching the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, which detailed actions tech companies should take to protect younger users on their platforms.</p><p>The pledges range from stopping existing and new child sex abuse material appearing on platforms to taking steps to stop the live streaming of abuse, and identifying and stopping grooming and predatory behaviour.</p><p>The proposals were endorsed by tech giants including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitter and Snap.</p><p>But Thursday's report identified how there were no evident barriers to pre-screening images.</p><p>It said: ``Industry has failed to do all it can to prevent access to images of child sexual abuse.</p><p>``The time has come to stop access to such imagery by requiring industry to pre-screen material. No industry witness said that such a step was technologically impossible.''</p><p>It said there had ``been an explosion in online-facilitated child sexual abuse'' and said ``law enforcement is struggling to keep pace''.</p><p>The report also found that indecent images of children could ``be accessed all too easily'', saying that the child involved was re-victimised each and every time the image was viewed.</p><p>The report said: ``The time has come for the Government to stop access to indecent images of children by requiring industry to pre-screen material.''</p><p>It added that while there was evidence of ``the positive intentions by industry to tackle online-facilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation'', there was ``a lack of a coherent long-term strategy on how this is to be achieved''.</p><p>The report concludes the latest strand of the inquiry, which has also focused on the role of the political establishment in dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse.</p><p>Responding, David Miles, Facebook's head of safety for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said the social media giant was an ``industry leader'' in combating child sexual exploitation.</p><p>He added: ``We have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions, including photo and video-matching technology so we can remove harmful content as quickly as possible.</p><p>``As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.''</p><p>Sue Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation charity which contributed evidence to the inquiry, welcomed the report and said there was ``no room for excuses''.</p><p>She said: ``This report has not only identified the scale of the abuse and the challenges being faced, but also highlighted that the time has come for action.</p><p>``There is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online.</p><p>``This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses.''</p><p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, described the report as ``a damning indictment of Big Tech's failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale''.</p><p>Labour MP Tracy Brabin, shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, added: ``It is utterly damning that major tech companies are not doing all they can to prevent access to images of child abuse online.''</p><p>Barnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan, added: ``We continue to urge the Government to act swiftly to regulate the internet and enforce serious sanctions for companies that break the rules and leave children in danger.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANEWS-HSA1170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDF-GP81-DYTG-N31S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8170</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><timeReceived>3:09 PM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Press Association Mediapoint</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31563\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 12, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No industry witness said that such a step was technologically impossible.''</p><p>It said there had ``been an explosion in online-facilitated child sexual abuse'' and said ``law enforcement is struggling to keep pace''.</p><p>The report also found that indecent images of children could ``be accessed all too easily'', saying that the child involved was re-victimised each and every time the image was viewed.</p><p>The report said: ``The time has come for the Government to stop access to indecent images of children by requiring industry to pre-screen material.''</p><p>It added that while there was evidence of ``the positive intentions by industry to tackle online-facilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation'', there was ``a lack of a coherent long-term strategy on how this is to be achieved''.</p><p>The report concludes the latest strand of the inquiry, which has also focused on the role of the political establishment in dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse.</p><p>Sue Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation charity which contributed evidence to the inquiry, welcomed the report and said there was ``no room for excuses''.</p><p>She said: ``This report has not only identified the scale of the abuse and the challenges being faced, but also highlighted that the time has come for action.</p><p>``There is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online.</p><p>``This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses.''</p><p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, described the report as ``a damning indictment of Big Tech's failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale''.</p><p>Labour MP Tracy Brabin, shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, added: ``It is utterly damning that major tech companies are not doing all they can to prevent access to images of child abuse online.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANEWS-HSA0910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDF-8YF1-DYTG-N2Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8170</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>1:57 PM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Press Association Mediapoint</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31563\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 12, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Other states, including Florida, recently took similar steps that free up municipalities such as Tallahassee that want to provide the service. Utilities such as Florida Power &amp; Light are also considering BPL.</p><p>The federal government also has pledged its support for BPL as a way to ensure that high-speed Internet service reaches every corner of the country.</p><p>Suddenly, \"there's a lot of good momentum,\" said Scott Bruce, managing director of Current Communications Group, which two weeks ago got a major investment - $100 million, according to published reports - from Google, media giant Hearst Corp. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.Current manages one of only a few commercial deployments of BPL service in the nation, near Cincinnati.</p><p>The problem is, the new momentum might be too little, too late. BPL may never become more than a niche technology limited to rural areas that can't get Internet service over TV cables or DSL telephone lines.</p><p>The idea of plugging into the World Wide Web by simply plugging into a wall socket has been around nearly as long as those two dominant broadband technologies.</p><p>With BPL, data travels over power lines from an Internet connection at a power plant to homes and offices. A customer simply plugs a computer into a wall socket or connects to a wireless transmitter mounted on a nearby power pole.</p><p>Just as significantly, BPL can give power companies unprecedented control over their power lines. With it, utilities can monitor lines for problems, read meters remotely and turn service on or off without dispatching employees.</p><p>\"Yes, you can provide consumers an alternative to cable and DSL, but more importantly this is a major tool that can transform utilities and bring them into the 21st century,\" said Raymond Blair, vice president of BPL initiatives for IBM.</p><p>Last week, IBM announced it was partnering with Houston's CenterPoint Energy Inc. to explore BPL technology and test it in about 50 homes.</p><p>Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co. has been considering BPL for nearly seven years. So far, the most intriguing application of the technology is for monitoring power lines and other equipment, said Leif Ericson, business development manager at Southern's telecom subsidiary.</p><p>\"We don't see ourselves as a broadband service provider or some sort of other ISP,\" Ericson said. \"Our real focus . . . has been on whether we might be able to overlay (BPL) to gain access to all sorts of intelligence\" about existing lines and equipment.</p><p>In all, about 40 utilities around the country have run or plan to run BPL trials.</p><p>Yet with the exception of Current partner Cinergy Corp. in Ohio, no investor-owned utility has committed to selling the service yet.</p><p>Even at Cinergy, some are less than enthusiastic about the year-old experiment.</p><p>\"We didn't anticipate this was going to happen overnight,\" said Cinergy spokeswoman Kathy Meinke. \"We're continuing to move forward.\"</p><p>Neither Cinergy nor Current would disclose how many customers have signed up for the service. While Cinergy earlier said it would expand beyond Cincinnati by next year, any expansion plans are still \"yet to be determined,\" Meinke said.</p><p>Cost is an issue. While the power lines that can carry broadband signals are already in place, it can cost $250 or more per household for equipment that gets the signals from a home to the power pole or underground line.</p><p>That's actually relatively cheap compared to cable and DSL equipment. But utilities are notoriously tight when it comes to spending on new technology. And the last time many of them strayed from their core business and tried to offer telephone voice service, they failed miserably.</p><p>Early BPL technology was slow and plagued with problems. Newer semiconductor technology has solved interference problems, industry officials claim, while speed has increased to double that of DSL and surpass cable at a comparable price.</p><p>Performance may have become a moot point because of utilities' lateness to the broadband business.</p><p>Today, with cable modem and DSL available to an estimated 90 percent of all households, there really isn't much of a market left for utilities offering BPL, said Jim Penhune, an analyst with technology research company Strategy Analytics.</p><p>\"I just think the timing of it is wrong,\" Penhune said. \"Cable (and telephone) companies are so far ahead . . . it's a little hard for me to see how a third class of network is going to be viable.\"</p><p>The recent interest from the big tech companies shows that the technology still has plenty of promise, said Brett Kilbourne, director of regulatory services for the trade group United Power Line Council. Along with Google and IBM, Motorola in May announced it was developing BPL technology and said it was teaming up with a rural South Carolina utility to launch BPL broadband service. Last year, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc. also announced it was exploring BPL technology.</p><p>At the same time, Kilbourne and other proponents say, there are still plenty of households - 13 million by some counts - that aren't able to get broadband access because cable and telecom companies simply don't offer it in their areas.</p><p>Also driving interest in BPL are recent court decisions that limit Internet companies' access to cable and phone lines.</p><p>Atlanta-based Earthlink Inc., for instance, has run several trials in North Carolina and elsewhere and is very encouraged, Vice President Kevin Brand said.</p><p>BPL's best shot at success may be in reaching rural households, said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Laszlo.</p><p>As a result, Laszlo predicts alternative broadband technologies including BPL, fixed wireless and satellite will triple their customers over the next five years, although they will still account for less than 3 percent of the broadband business.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bkeefe@coxnews.com\">bkeefe@coxnews.com</email></p><p>Broadband via power lines</p><p>Speed</p><p>(downloads/uploads): 3 Mbps/3 Mbps</p><p>Monthly pricing:</p><p>$25-$30</p><p>The skinny: Speeds are faster and steadier than other types of broadband service, but availability is very limited.

Internet of things brings to our house devices packed with various sensors[1], cameras, microphones, and capability to transfer data over the Internet. How do we know that those devices are not sending the data where they shouldn't?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/markus-spiske-cvBBO4PzWPg-unsplash.jpgIoT\">https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/markus-spiske-cvBBO4PzWPg-unsplash.jpgIoT</url> solutions to data security concerns. Internet of Things is a big privacy concern.Customers who buy an IoT-enabled product should know that the device will always transmit some data over the internet. It is how they work, and it is what makes them so easy to set, adjust, and control. But there are limits to what data the devices should and should not transmit. Some information, that may be normal for an Original Equipment Manufacturer to gather and transfer. But it may not be acceptable for the end-user. Are we actually on the same page with OEM? According to a recent study from a collaboration of Northeastern University and Imperial College London [2]\u2014 not so much. The researchers have looked into numerous pieces of IoT consumer tech. They have studied smart TVs, streaming dongles, speakers, and video doorbells from big vendors like Google, Roku, and Amazon. As the study has shown, most devices gathered an excessive amount of data[3]: IP addresses, devices' specs, usage habits, and location. The devices were not only sending collected data to OEM. They were also sharing it with third party-companies, even those who had nothing to do with the customer. For instance, most of the TVs have sent info about the TV model and location to Netflix. But the researches haven't installed Netflix on any of the TVs. Among those third-parties, we can see many advertising companies. They are using the provided data to better target ads to the clients. Back in 2017, the CIA has developed the malware which kept smart TVs on to record customers' conversations. The 'Weeping Ange[4]' project, or so-called 'Fake-Off mode' could have put people's personal lives to danger, exposing their sensitive information.The problem of IoT privacy policyOEMs of the IoT enabled devices are trying to resolve the issue by providing the customers with privacy policies[5]. Before starting to use the product, the client can read the document describing what data the product collects. Also, the document contains info about what purpose the collected data serves. To use the product, the customer has to accept the policy. The problem is that many of the IoT devices do not have a screen[6]. No screen means no way for a firmware to display a privacy policy agreement. Some devices, which have to be paired with a mobile app, may display policy on a mobile device screen. But still \u2014 privacy policies are not an effective solution to the problem. But most of the time such documents are hefty and full of legalese. They are hard to read and comprehend, and most of the users just skip those.Strict regulation can solve the security problemNow we learn about more companies collecting too much data from their users[7]. To protect themselves, they start to encrypt the data which their products transmit. The data encryption solves the problem in a certain way. It makes it harder to steal the data. And at the same time encryption makes it harder for researchers to learn, what it actually is that the company gathers. This way, they have little to no ways to see if the OEM is the only one who receives the transferred data. Enabling everyday object with data transfer capabilities[8] open a whole lot of chance for your data to be compromised. The Internet of Things technology has a long way ahead of it in terms of securing that data[9]. The real solution to the problem would be strict regulation. The law must limit the number of companies that extract the data from IoT enabled devices. It makes sense for an OEM to gather your information, but we don't need advertisers getting too close. It is obvious that people will keep on surrounding themselves with connected devices. Doing so, it is important to do thorough research on not only the product you are looking to buy. And try to be cautious when purchasing IoT products with built-in cameras and microphones. Apart from that, look into the OEM which you are buying from[10]. A decent IoT developer makes privacy a default. The company makes sure that the data does not get in the hands of third party companies from day one \u2014 not after the wrist slaps from the media. Therefore the set of data serves one and only purpose of powering the IoT infrastructure[11]. Sergei Vardomatski[12] Since 2001, Sergei has been a strong strategic thinker and an inspiring leader. Holding a degree in international economics he utilizes his knowledge to develop HQSoftware as a world-class IoT service vendor. Under Sergei's leadership, the company has grown and consolidated its position as a leader in IoT development.

This report also covers all the regions and countries of the world, which shows a regional development status, including market size. Dallas, United States - August 23, 2018 /MarketersMedia/ \u2014 Global Internet of Things Market 2018:The IoT encompasses a rich, and complex ecosystem of technologies and technology companies - from the manufacturers of the sensors and microchips that go inside the connected devices to the telecom operators and wireless radio manufacturers that connect these devices to the internet, to the software services organizations that help clients stitch everything together. </p><p>While topics like wearable tech, connected cars and the smart home enjoy the limelight, other subsets of the IoT which reside in much less glamorous environments - like smart cities or the use of IoT in manufacturing or in product maintenance - will deliver the biggest economic benefits. The IoT lies within the eye of a storm that has been whipped up by a combination of several megatrends: the decline in cost of the core technologies (sensors, chips, batteries and communications modules); the increasing ubiquity and falling cost of connectivity; the growth in the capacity of data analytics and processing technology; and the increasing ease with which applications can be integrated with one another. Scope of Internet of Things Market:- The report highlights the significance of connected devices that help organizations stitch everything together.- It further ponders on the fact that while topics like wearable tech, connected cars and the smart home enjoy the limelight, other subsets of the IoT which reside in much less glamorous environments - like smart cities or the use of IoT in manufacturing or in product maintenance - will deliver the biggest economic benefits.- The report also highlights key winners in each of the four layers of the IoT value chain - device layer, connectivity layer, data layer, and app layer.

title 'Internet of Things - Thematic Research' with detailed analysis, forecast and strategies.<br/><br/>The study covers key regions and important players such as Akamai, Amazon, Apple, Broadcom etc.</p><p><br/><br/>Request a sample report @ <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.htfmarketreport.com/sample-report/1261886-internet-of-things-thematic-research\">https://www.htfmarketreport.com/sample-report/1261886-internet-of-things-thematic-research</url><br/><br/>The IoT encompasses a rich, and complex ecosystem of technologies and technology companies - from the manufacturers of the sensors and microchips that go inside the connected devices to the telecom operators and wireless radio manufacturers that connect these devices to the internet, to the software services organizations that help clients stitch everything together.<br/><br/>While topics like wearable tech, connected cars and the smart home enjoy the limelight, other subsets of the IoT which reside in much less glamorous environments - like smart cities or the use of IoT in manufacturing or in product maintenance - will deliver the biggest economic benefits.<br/><br/>The IoT lies within the eye of a storm that has been whipped up by a combination of several megatrends: the decline in cost of the core technologies (sensors, chips, batteries and communications modules); the increasing ubiquity and falling cost of connectivity; the growth in the capacity of data analytics and processing technology; and the increasing ease with which applications can be integrated with one another.<br/><br/>Scope<br/><br/>- The Report Highlights the significance of connected devices that help organizations stitch everything together.<br/><br/>- It further ponders on the fact that while topics like wearable tech, connected cars and the smart home enjoy the limelight, other subsets of the IoT which reside in much less glamorous environments - like smart cities or the use of IoT in manufacturing or in product maintenance - will deliver the biggest economic benefits.<br/><br/>- The report also highlights key winners in each of the four layers of the IoT value chain - device layer, connectivity layer, data layer, and app layer.<br/><br/>Buy this report @       \u00a0    <url

Following last month's walkout, Google said it would overhaul its reporting process for harassment and provide more transparency to employees about incidents reported to the company.</p><p>Cerf said he expects workers and tech users to continue to demand transparency: \"There's a heightened awareness of the potential harms that can occur if personal information is exposed inappropriately,\" he said. \"In the absence of that transparency, you may find some people rejecting those services and saying they don't want to use or work for them anymore.\"</p><p>Employers will have to spell out the terms of their processes in a way that's easy to digest, Cerf said.</p><p>\"You could understand why people would be upset because they thought they had an agreement. (They) can't say, 'Well, we told you in 72 pages worth of whatever it is, and you say, 'but I didn't have time to read all that.' At some point, companies will have to produce very clear and very terse descriptions of what they do. In the absence of that transparency, you may find some people rejecting those services and saying they don't want to use or work for them anymore.\"</p><p>Cerf gave the example of a time working with then-Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration: \"Al Gore was responsible for finding ways of getting government documents to be written in simplified language,\" Cerf recalled. \"They also went after the insurance companies and they said, 'you must describe in plain and simple terms what is and isn't covered in the insurance policy so your users understand exactly what they are covered for and what they're not covering for.' \"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

If we are to remain a world challenger, we need to up our game and factor in the significant cost of poorly targeted regulation.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Dyball, UK Executive Director at Internet Association, who represent leading global internet companies, said on the release of the ASI's new report:</emphasis><br/>\"This report highlights a number of important areas as we look towards the future of the internet and internet policy in the UK. Intermediary liability protections, for example, are fundamental to the success of the internet as we know it. Internet Association is committed to working with the government to find a regulatory framework that deals with genuine concerns about keeping people safe online, while retaining the significant economic and social benefits that internet companies provide to the UK.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jim Killock, Executive Director of digital rights organisation Open Rights Group said:</emphasis><br/>\"This report is a timely reminder that regulation can have adverse consequences, especially for free expression. Regulation impacting free speech can have unintended consequences and needs to be cautious. The strong link between free expression and economic innovation is also well described. Policymakers should consider why the UK has lost sight of these important considerations in recent years.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Notes to editors:  </emphasis><br/>For further comments or to arrange an interview, contact Matt Kilcoyne, Head of Communications, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:matt@adamsmith.org\">matt@adamsmith.org</email> | 07904 099599.<br/>READ THE REPORT NOW         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-66447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG2-5571-JCMP-50M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Adam Smith, Great Britain All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Adam Smith Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 20, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

From encrypted apps used by terrorists (but also by peaceful activists) to online abuse, and fake news to hacking and radicalisation, the friction between the two sides is growing. France and Germany have implemented fines for companies that allow Nazi content to remain online, while in the US the FBI demanded that Apple write software to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers, and took the firm to court when it refused.</p><p>Internet companies, meanwhile, suggest that governments should butt out because these companies control the tools that can sort out the problems. However, governments have much to say on the matter. The European commission's decision to fine Google (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) for favouring its own shopping service - with decisions yet to come on its control of Android and the Google Play app store - suggest that some problems, at least, are seen as the province of legislators.</p><p>In the meantime, the public is caught in the middle: relying on both tech companies and government, and often as puzzled as the politicians why so little can be done. (In the FBI-Apple case, public opinion about which side was correct was almost evenly split; the FBI eventually dropped the case when it found another company to carry out the hack.)</p><p>Why, politicians and public ask, can't these companies give us just the benefits of digital communication, and not the downsides? It's the implication of May's remarks; it's the implication of the frosty meetings between successive home secretaries and internet executives, such as the one two weeks ago between Amber Rudd and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, who, the Sun reported, planned to \"refuse MI5 access to terror plotters' encrypted messages\". This makes it sound as though Sandberg could somehow personally reverse the encryption built in to WhatsApp (which Facebook owns) or Telegram (favoured by terror groups for features such as time-limited messages - and which Facebook doesn't own). She can't, or at least in WhatsApp's case to do so would render it hopelessly insecure for everything, while leaving untouched the scores of other apps using the unbottled genie of unbreakable encryption.</p><p>At this point, the word \"regulation\" always surfaces. Can't governments regulate the internet, or regulate the companies? The idea of a \"bonfire of regulations\" was popular after the Brexit vote. Following the Grenfell Tower calamity, however, the notion that regulation might actually be useful is back in vogue. If you enforce regulations for cladding, why not for videos and other content online?</p><p>To some, the idea of regulation is more complex. \"Since when has the internet not been regulated? It's simply regulated poorly,\" says Douglas Rushkoff, a media commentator who was one of the earliest to spot the potential of the internet in the early 1990s. Back then, he says, \"we cyberpunks saw the law as the enemy. They had been arresting the best of us for 'hacking' into things. Teenagers were thrown into jail in Operation Sun Devil [in 1990]. So we agreed with [ Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Perry] Barlow when he established the net as a government-free zone in his declaration of independence of cyberspace.\"</p><p>That document, published in 1996, proclaimed (with a certain pompous certainty) that the internet was a new place entirely, which would be beyond the regulatory grasp of the \"weary giants of flesh and steel\" and that \"you [governments] have no moral right to rule us, nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear\".</p><p>Bill Clinton's administration was happy enough to allow that idea to flourish in order to let this new avenue of commerce to grow, effectively turning the net into the equivalent of an economic free-trade zone by loosening tax laws (a move that significantly benefited Amazon, among others). Everyone was happy - for a while, at least. \"What we didn't realise was that pushing government off the net made it a free for all for corporations, and a new form of digital capitalism was born,\" Rushkoff says.</p><p>That capitalism has enabled the rise of \"winner takes all\" businesses, where Google and Facebook get more than 70% of all US online advertising spending, and are increasing that share. Tick off a few names - Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter - and you have the names of the companies whose platforms control almost all of what you see online.</p><p>There are two driving forces behind any internet company: first, capture a gigantic audience that depends on your service. Second, figure out how to make money from them. Ultra-growth often comes from breaking the usual rules of business (particularly the initial need to make a profit) and exploiting loopholes in, or just ignoring, the law. Many companies operate with an underlying assumption that the law somehow doesn't apply to the internet; a number of companies have discovered belatedly that it certainly does, from Napster ( shut after court rulings ) to TV re-broadcaster Aereo ( shut down after a US supreme court ruling ) to Airbnb ( reined in by local rental regulations ) to Uber ( reined in by city transport regulations ).</p><p>When it works, though, that growth creates a \"network effect\" (where you want to join a network because your friends are on it; you won't leave for another one because none of your friends are on that). Monetisation then draws in the money being spent in that niche, and depletes the money available for rivals, including those using old technology. Because the internet favours the nimble, smaller companies reap the early benefits, and then increase their grip by strengthening the network effect.</p><p>Is that good, though? Jaron Lanier, an internet pioneer who first espoused the idea of commercial virtual reality (in the 1990s), worried in his 2013 book Who Owns the Future? that the way new companies such as Instagram use the internet is destroying the middle class by removing jobs and offering no replacement. \" It's a winner-take-all capitalism that's not sustainable,\" he told Salon. He pointed to Instagram, not then owned by Facebook, as having just 13 employees, and having effectively wiped out Kodak, the camera and film-maker, which had employed thousands. Where, he asked, had those thousands of jobs gone? No one quite knows.</p><p>Even as they revel in their network-reinforced positions, the big tech companies are battling with problems so big and intractable, and so far-reaching in their effects, that to find comparisons in the real world you have to look for truly global phenomena. The problems engendered by the internet have crept up on us over the years, but only recently have they seemed overwhelming. It's like a social form of climate change, and the analogy works surprisingly well.</p><p>When the industrial revolution got under way, replacing human labour with machines was more efficient, more powerful, and expanded humanity's horizons. Machines powered by coal and then oil liberated people from drudgery and made entirely new lifestyles possible.</p><p>No one knew that the accretion of emissions from those machines would contribute to potentially devastating climatic, and hence societal, changes. Even if they had known in the 1800s that steam power would affect the ice sheets of the recently discovered continent of Antarctica, so that two centuries later sea levels and surface temperatures would be rising, would they have cared? After all, it's hard to say enough people do even now.</p><p>Comparing the internet's social effects to climate change, one sees many of the same modest initial intents and big longer-term effects. For example, Twitter's founders were trying to create a messaging system that could work on mobile phones and would be like the status messages used on desktop chat systems. Then they discovered it could offer real-time updates from anywhere, from plane crashes in the Hudson to what's presently skittering across Donald Trump's mind. But it has also contributed to an atmosphere where users can be harassed on a scale unimaginable in physical form. Twitter's founders would have been - and still are - appalled by the idea that they had created a service that would enable the organised harassment of women (as seen in the Gamergate dispute), or the organisation of the \"alt-right\", or the disruption by paid Russian trolls of the US presidential election and, perhaps, Brexit.</p><p>But they built the engines for it. In 2012, Twitter's UK general manager, Tony Wang, told a London audience that, in the view of its chief executive (then Dick Costolo, since replaced by the returning founder Biz Stone) and its chief counsel, the social network was \" the free-speech wing of the free-speech party \". \"There are Twitter rules about what you can and can't do on the platform,\" he added. However, those rules were exceedingly loosely applied. Extremists and troublemakers of all stripes flourished on Twitter; after a while it wasn't their presence that was shocking, but their being banished.</p><p>The idea that anything not legally actionable was probably permissible was the diesel engine at the heart of Twitter. Only when it had been running for long enough and grown big enough would its deleterious effects become obvious. In the hurry to achieve scale, Twitter forgot to build in the equivalent of emissions checks. The result? All those noxious effects that you've heard about. The emergent problem of thousands of people intent on harassing others from anonymous accounts - and creating new ones if they were deleted or blocked - had never been seen at any scale in the real world.</p><p>Twitter keeps wrestling with the problem, but it is too big for it to cope with; the only way to stop the abuse would be to fundamentally change how Twitter works. But Twitter gives no sign of doing that, despite the evidence from surveys - most recently by Ofcom - showing that such abuse puts women off using social networks. In the physical world, a systemic design flaw that discourages half your potential customer base would be cause for a rethink; in the technological world, it's just tough on them.</p><p>Fake news is a similar \"global warming\" problem. Facebook became the breeding ground for fake news entirely by its accidental mixing of a gigantic daily audience of a billion people, a news feed system biased to show you content that either outraged or reinforced your views, and the binary American political system. Google, meanwhile, unwittingly promoted sexist, racist or just inaccurate search results by blindly following its underlying business model, which rewards content that gets attention, regardless of accuracy.</p><p>It's like a coal-fired power station, providing exactly what huge numbers of people want, but over time inconveniencing everyone just a little; and for those too close to its exhaust, a lot. Also like global warming, the process produces secondary effects: just as a warmer planet makes the sea a little higher, so the focus by the internet giants on attention over accuracy nudges media outlets towards \"clickbait\" rather than in-depth focus; like migrating fish, they're just adapting to stay alive in the conditions.</p><p>And YouTube? Google repeatedly points out that hours of video are uploaded to it every second. How can it spot extremist videos or radicalisation content among those? Last month, Google's chief lawyer, Kent Walker, said that \" there should be no place for terrorist content on our services \", and \"the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now.\"</p><p>Walker's answer wasn't to get video uploads approved by humans (as happens at publishers), but the application of unspecified \"technology\" to \"help identify extremist and terrorism-related videos\" - although more humans will be trusted to have correctly flagged such content.</p><p>Once again, it feels like a minimalist approach to a huge problem. Go back to what Theresa May said: extremism gets a place to breed, and \"that is precisely what the internet - and the big companies that provide internet-based services - provide\". Recent research has found that extremist content from Islamic State can remain on YouTube for days (though the median period seems to be less than 24 hours). By offering an open platform, YouTube has created its own impossible challenge; it can't prevent extremist video being on there unless either it stops people being extremist or examines every video before it is published, the very suggestion of which horrifies internet executives.</p><p>YouTube and Facebook and Twitter argue that they aren't publishers, but more like the phone company, providing a service to people who are free to use it well, or badly. That would be true, except that they are happy to do the equivalent of cutting off phone calls - or your phone service - when they detect the wrong sort of content. Just like the phone company too, they will let the police and intelligence services monitor what goes on, given a court order. It simply puts their surveillance tools temporarily in the hands of the authorities. That all becomes moot once those targeted for monitoring are using encrypted apps such as Telegram: it's not physically possible to tap what goes on in those communications.</p><p>The inherent contradictions in the positions, both of governments and the tech companies, irks some. \"With regard to Isis using Telegram to organise, there is a disconnect here,\" says Maciej Ceglowski, a Polish-American web developer who is trying to organise Silicon Valley workers to agitate against cooperation with Trump's administration. \"On the one hand, the police feel threatened because there may be technological means to have a conversation that no one can eavesdrop on. That's never been the case before. [But] the police have never had the tools of mass surveillance that they do now. We have never been as monitored as we are now. So you end up in a situation where the police are complaining about inadequate surveillance, even as they build a surveillance state the Stasi could only dream about. They see it in terms of losing a power they used to have [eavesdropping by court order], while ignoring the enormous increase in their power brought by technological changes.\"</p><p>Ceglowski is hardly a household name even inside tech: he runs a paid-for bookmarking site called Pinboard, which has just 24,000 users. What sets him apart is that his self-funded business makes an operating profit of about $200,000 annually. His perspective is important because he has never succumbed to the grandiloquent ambitions of Silicon Valley. Quite the reverse: \"I enjoy the looking-glass aspect of our industry, where running a mildly profitable small business makes me a crazy maverick not afraid to break all the rules,\" he said in 2014.</p><p>The warnings from those such as Ceglowski is that governments - Chinese, Turkish, American - will abuse the existence of personal data to take advantage of it. Ceglowski, who began thinking that the \"surveillance capitalism\" model was a bad idea in 2013, when Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA intrusions and court-sanctioned access to data held by big tech firms became public, has become increasingly politically active in the past year. He's organising meetings of technology workers, urging them to resist the inessential gathering of data; he has helped organise a petition telling tech chiefs such as Apple's Tim Cook not to meet Trump. \"I was frustrated that everyone fixated on the NSA, while meanwhile the apparatus of commercial surveillance was orders of magnitude bigger,\" he says of his 2013 epiphany.</p><p>The big companies strongly resist any encroachment on their own monitoring of users. Governments have, so far, not forced the point. (Countries like Turkey prefer to block services such as Twitter rather than demand access to them, which is refused.) That makes the companies increasingly powerful - perhaps, over time, even more powerful than any government. When you search for sofas on one site, and then every other site you view shows you sofa ads, that is \"surveillance capitalism\" at work. You might be annoyed by it, but in the view of the tech giants, your only task is to be the passive receiver of the interaction between the site and the advertiser.</p><p>Aral Balkan, an online rights activist who has written software to block such online tracking, says: \"If this is the fourth industrial revolution, as some call it, what are the raw materials if not us - people? What people don't understand is that we are talking about something way more fundamental being at stake here: our personhood in the digital age.</p><p>\"If you see technology as an extension of the self, then what is at stake is the integrity of our selves. Without that - without individual sovereignty - we're looking at a new slavery. A slavery by proxy of digital copies of our selves, if you will. Data about a thing, if you have enough of it, starts approaching the thing itself. If I have enough data about a figurine, I can take a 3D printer and create a replica of it. What can I do if I have enough data about you?\"</p><p>That point - what can you do with enough data about a person? - forms the basis for identity theft, of course: thieves collect just enough information to be able to pretend to be you to an organisation. In his short story The Unreconstructed M, the science fiction writer Philip K Dick imagined a world where the police could identify you based on nine individual pieces of data such as blood type, weight, shoe size, or hair variety; given enough evidence from a crime scene, they could say exactly who was there.</p><p>Dick, it turns out, was insufficiently ambitious. Facebook uses at least 16, and up to 98, personal data points about you in order to decide what adverts to show you. The precision can go as far as \"How much money [you] are likely to spend on your next car\" and \"Where [you] are likely to buy your next car\". The 98th data point, as of last year, was whether you participate in a timeshare. Facebook collects data about your politics too - with the world split, in a technologist's binary fashion, into \"conservatives and liberals\" (it's data point 31).</p><p>What will the long-term effects of this sort of endless bifurcation be on how we understand society? We don't yet know, just as we couldn't foresee how the rise of Google and Facebook and Twitter would give rise to their peculiar effects on our knowledge economy. Government attempts to regulate how some app companies use encryption and what videos are available feel like tinkering around at the edges. The companies keep trying to pre-empt any formal moves: last Monday, the collective of Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube and Twitter announced the creation of a \"global internet forum\" to counter terrorism, which will work with governments and non-governmental organisations to create a self-regulating group \"to identify how best to counter extremism and online hate\".</p><p>It might look like the response to Theresa May. But remember how oil companies didn't like the suggestion that there should be limits on vehicle emissions, or that carbon use should be taxed. Technology companies are exactly the same. They really don't like the idea that they should change. YouTube is never going to suggest that some videos, even from known terrorist organisations, should be vetted; that would be the thinnest end of a long wedge that governments around the world could drive into its business model. Nor will Facebook agree to anything that might reduce revenues.</p><p>But we, as citizens, are being affected by the rising sea of data being collected by these companies, and there doesn't appear to be an easy way to opt out. Governments say they want \"regulation\" of the internet. But they're looking at the wrong problems. The real problems are caused by the combination of human behaviour - with all its extremes - and the enabling engines of these giant firms. The global network is reshaping our social contract. The worry is that it might catch fire.</p><p>                   Is it time to regulate the net? Leading lights have their say                   </p><p>                     Martha Lane Fox                                          Crossbench peer and founder of doteveryone.org, which campaigns for a fairer internet                   </p><p>Now is the time to bring democratic standards to the internet - ones that let us own and articulate how our digital society should work.</p><p>Regulation does not have to be oppressive; done well, it can be a positive articulation of who we are and what we value. But to succeed, we're going to need a much more nuanced conversation than we've had so far - one where both politicians and the tech industry work harder to understand each other and recognise their obligations.</p><p>That means no more kneejerk \"enough is enough\" policies from the political world, and no more wriggling out of tax bills or employee rights from tech. If we combine our civic society, legal, academic, business and technical expertise, we can set a standard for the world. But we need to act now, or else we'll lose control of our digital destinies.</p><p>                     Douglas Rushkoff                                          Author of Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus                   </p><p>Is it time to regulate the internet? Since when has the internet not been regulated? It's simply regulated poorly, and more often by coders rather than lawyers. And that's probably our own fault.</p><p>Back in the 1990s, we cyberpunks saw the law as the enemy. They had been arresting the best of us for \"hacking\" into things. Teenagers were thrown into jail in Operation Sun Devil. So we agreed with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) co-founder John Perry Barlow when he established the net as a government-free zone in his Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace. What we didn't realise was that pushing government off the net made it entirely safe for corporations, and a new form of digital capitalism was born.</p><p>Today, instead of receiving legal monopoly charters from the king, companies establish monopolies with code. They regulate who can do what by controlling the platforms on which we attempt to interact or exchange value. Selling on Amazon, promoting on Facebook or sharing data with Google are all regulated by the companies that own these platforms, and to their own advantage.</p><p>The question is not whether to regulate, but who or what should be doing it. In a distributed digital environment, regulations might best emerge through protocols and consensus of the people in the network. This could mean retrieving the mechanisms of the commons, forcibly repressed by government in the late Middle Ages, but due for a comeback. A commons is really just a set of regulations for a shared resource, but imposed by the people who actually use it. The network would itself be responsible for enforcement, and even punishment, of those who violate the agreements that have been established for its sustainability.</p><p>Of course, that could be a long way off, which is why the very first step is for people to recognise that regulations are already in place and already being enforced by the companies who currently rule the net. They don't make these regulations explicit as law, but rather embed them in the platforms themselves. Once we become capable of recognising the way these limits are not pre-existing biases of technology but arbitrary choices of its developers, we will be better prepared to choose new ones.</p><p>                     Greg Williams                                          Editor of Wired                   </p><p>It's important to separate two elements; firstly, the infrastructure of the internet - meaning the connected networks based on standardised communication protocols - which should remain free to use and open to all. The ability for people to share knowledge across borders is unquestionably something that must be protected, as should net neutrality [the principle that all data should be treated in the same way].</p><p>The other question is to do with the power of a handful of large companies. It's hard to argue that an organisation with an 88% market share (Google with search) or 77% of mobile social traffic (Facebook and ancillaries Whatsapp, Instagram and Messenger) aren't monopolies.</p><p>Regulation could potentially have a public good - without stymying innovation - in two areas. Consumers need to be know what data is being held on them and how it's being used, and tech companies - which pride themselves on solving hard problems - need to stop describing themselves as mere platforms and take greater responsibility for the content they distribute.</p><p>                     Helen Magretts                                          Oxford Internet Institute                   </p><p>Internet-based platforms now form the basis of our social environment. They make our democratic weather, and host vast interconnected seas of social interaction, sparkling rivers of entertainment and new mountains of commercial enterprise. But policy-makers pay unbelievably little attention to the protection of our internet-based environment, until some kind of disaster for which they rush to blame 'the' internet. 'Enough is enough' is even more meaningless as 'Brexit means Brexit'. Any successful attempt to prevent extremist, abusive and hateful behavior online must be multifaceted, thoughtful and collaborative. It will involve ethical and legal frameworks to guide as well as mandate good behaviour; working with tech companies rather than making enemies of them; smarter policing of activities that are already illegal; and crowdsourcing safety, so that people and social enterprises play a role (remember the Manchester bomber's behaviour had been reported to authorities several times and not followed up - that is not Google's fault). Attempting to ban encryption would poison relations with (for example) Facebook while driving miscreants to far darker and harder-to-reach places, representing a massive act of environmental pollution.</p><p>                     Martha Spurrier                                          Director of Liberty                   </p><p>In the wake of appalling terrorist attacks, it's tempting to react hastily rather than effectively - and the internet is an easy target. But our online freedoms have not caused terrorism, and curbing them will do nothing to defeat it. The internet should be policed in the same way all public spaces are, with the rule of law ensuring criminals are prosecuted. Clearly, there are challenges of resources - but we have no shortfall in law.</p><p>And with the digital realm offering opportunities for free speech, free press, and free assembly, it's vital our rights are upheld there. But the Investigatory Powers Act  means every single person using the internet is being monitored in a way we'd find completely unacceptable offline, in a clear breach of our human rights. Like any free zone, the internet should be policed - but it should also be celebrated. What needs regulating is the surveillance state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-36106908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NXK-NHW1-JCJY-G3P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4595\"/><timeReceived>9:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 2, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Web regulators are getting into their groove. But are they going too quickly?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  This past week, the British government proposed new powers to issue fines and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content on their platforms. My colleague Adam Satariano said it ''would be one of the world's most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online content.''</p><p>  Days earlier, Australia passed legislation that threatens fines for social media companies that fail to rapidly remove violent material. And there's a growing pipeline of other internet regulation, along with existing laws like the European Union's sweeping General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>  ''We're entering a new phase of hyper regulation,'' said Paul Fehlinger, the deputy executive director of the Internet and Jurisdiction Policy Network, an organization established to understand how national laws affect the internet.</p><p>  This flurry of content rules is understandable. Much of the material they would police is abhorrent, and social media's rapid rise has caught lawmakers off guard; now the public wants something done.</p><p>  But the regulations could have unintended consequences.</p><p>  Difficulties in defining ''harmful'' mean governments will develop different standards. In turn, the web could easily look different depending on your location -- a big shift from its founding principles. (This is already happening: The Chicago Tribune's website, for example, doesn't comply with General Data Protection Regulation, so there's no access to it from Europe.)</p><p>  There may be less visible effects. If regulation required differences at a hardware level, that could fragment the infrastructure, said Konstantinos Komaitis, a senior director at the nonprofit Internet Society, which promotes the open development and use of the internet. That could make the internet less resilient to outages and attacks.</p><p>  And bigger, richer companies will find it easier to comply with sprawling regulation, which could reinforce the power of Big Tech.</p><p>  ''There is a major risk that we end up in a situation where short-term political pressure trumps long-term vision,'' Mr. Fehlinger said.</p><p>  Mr. Komaitis said avoiding unintended consequences was ''very simple, yet very difficult.''</p><p>  ''It is all about collaboration,'' he added. The idea: lawmakers work together across borders to ensure rules are more consistent.</p><p>  The challenge is that collaboration could slow the pace of regulation that lawmakers desire. But Mr. Komaitis said many proposed regulations lack clear plans for implementation, and envisions snags when governments come to apply them. If they struggle, he said, collaboration and sharing of expertise may be the only way to make their plans work.</p><p>  [How is technology blurring the lines between public and private? Sign up to Charlie Warzel's new limited-run newsletter to find out more -- and what you can do stop it.]</p><p>  A.I. ethics: Work in progress</p><p>  Artificial intelligence could make our lives easier and more efficient. But, like any powerful technology, it's more complicated than that. A.I. can be used for surveillance. To control autonomous weapons. It can be biased. It could erode jobs. The list goes on.</p><p>  None of those are reasons to reject A.I. outright. But they underscore how its development must be approached with care.</p><p>  Big Tech has struggled to publicly demonstrate that care. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all drawn criticism for their A.I. work with military and government agencies. Just this month, Google's plan to create an A.I. ethics board ended disastrously when backlash about board members led to its dissolution.</p><p>  Missteps should be called out, especially when they're made by such powerful corporations. But in an emergent field, mistakes also serve as lessons. And a new set of A.I. ethics guidelines from the European Commission is a good example of how trial and error will be a fundamental part of ethical A.I. development.</p><p>  The guidelines, developed by 52 experts, contain seven requirements that A.I. systems should meet to be deemed trustworthy. What stands out about them for Charlotte Stix, a policy officer at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University, is that they're designed to be carried out.</p><p>  Unlike other A.I. ethics guidelines, they attempt to join ethical principles to firm recommendations -- something that has divided opinions among some people working in the field. That's why the European Commission hopes companies will adopt and test them between now and 2020, so that they can be improved.</p><p>  Frank Buytendijk, a vice president in Gartner's data and analytics group, said the guidelines sent a message to big tech companies that may have struggled with A.I. ethics in the past: ''Here's your chance to do the right thing.''</p><p>  Why Big Tech loves satellites</p><p>Amazon joined the ranks of tech companies wanting to blanket the world with the internet.</p><p>  Its Project Kuiper plan, which came to light in filings made by the Federal Communications Commission, would put 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit to deliver the internet to ''underserved communities around the world.'' It has been likened to a network under development by SpaceX. Facebook has plans for a similar system, and Google has teamed up with the satellite operator Telesat along the same lines.</p><p>  These initiatives seek to provide affordable internet connections to people who currently lack them -- from Alaska to sub-Saharan Africa. Satellites appear to be a front-runner: Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal noted that, according to the satellite industry veteran Shayn Hawthorne, ''some kind of affordable satellite internet now appears inevitable.''</p><p>  For big tech companies, this is not selfless. A good example of why is the Free Basics program offered by Facebook's nonprofit Internet.org: a zero-cost data service that provides access in some developing countries to a curated group of websites, including Facebook. In locations that are essentially untapped markets, its provision of the web can help it secure new users.</p><p>  Other Big Tech players are unlikely to want to miss out.</p><p>  And some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Does privacy matter? What do companies know, and how do they know it? And what can we do about it? The New York Times is trying to answer those questions for you.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 What you've heard about Chinese A.I. may be bluster. Jeff Ding from Oxford University says the West has overhyped China's abilities.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 China might ban Bitcoin mining. A government agency added it to a list of industries that it proposes to eliminate.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 It's all I.P.O.s. Uber and Pinterest are the next big tech unicorns to go public, in the coming month.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Amazon's cloud might be a potent spy tool for the United States. That's why it's unsuitable for storing German police data, Germany's top data protection officer told Politico.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Big Tech's data tricks are under scrutiny. Facebook will change its terms of service to explain its use of data in response to pressure from the European Commission. And Senators Mark Warner and Deb Fischer introduced a bill aimed at clamping down on user-interface tricks that encourage data sharing.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Amazon or Microsoft will build the Pentagon's cloud. They were the only bidders to meet the ''minimum requirements'' to win the $10 billion contract. One will be chosen.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 YouTube had to shut down comments on a House hearing about social media. The live stream of the event, focused on white nationalism, was overrun by racist comments.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The House passed a bill to revive net neutrality. But the legislation faces long odds in the Republican-led Senate.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Amazon workers are listening to our Alexa commands. They even share some amusing ones in an internal chat room.</p><p>  Jamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter. He also writes the weekly Bits newsletter.

Concerns about illegal activities and behaviour are driving a debate about policy and regulation. However very few practical solutions are being proposed too often there is a general call for the big tech companies to do \"something\", without any clarity as to what exactly they should do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fear of digital technology is growing, some of it well founded, some less so. Fear of new technology technophobia - is not new nor is it unique to the internet. Opponents of the US postal service claimed it would encourage immorality by allowing the private delivery of birth control materials. Opponents of photography said it would ruin visual art, opponents of film said it would encourage loose sexual morals. History teaches us the importance of a balanced approach to challenges we face, including how we adjust to and manage emerging technologies.</p><p>It should be obvious that the internet and associated digital technologies are overwhelmingly beneficial, in fact they are essential. Services such as health, education, transport and utilities depend upon it. Modern business depends upon digital technology. Online banking and shopping are flourishing. New businesses have sprung into existence and now dominate the FTSE 500. Maintaining an open global internet architecture is key to sustaining a beneficial internet. In turn this also means respecting users' privacy and ensuring adequate encryption. No one would want to use an online banking system with a built in \"back door\".</p><p>The tragedy of the commons</p><p>But we cannot close our eyes to the challenges facing the global internet. In 1968 an evolutionary biologist, Garret Hardin, published an essay in the journal Science called \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" a theory highlighting the problems of overpopulation. Since then the term has been used to describe any situation where individual users acting out of self-interest undermine the common good of all users by abusing the commons through their cumulative actions. It is a fair summary of the challenge on an open interconnected internet where terrorists, child abusers, misogynists, racists and criminals can flourish and threaten the integrity of the internet \"commons\".</p><p>The traditional response of governments to the tragedy of the commons has been to fence it off which in the internet world would be equivalent to establishing 190 or more separate legal jurisdictions and 190+ internets, which would end the internet as we know it. Can we preserve the open character of the internet without it becoming walled off national property? Is there a way of regulating content that recognises the uniqueness of the internet compared to offline communications?</p><p>There are two obvious differences between the online and offline worlds the sheer volume of content published every second, (for example one hour of content uploaded onto YouTube every second) and the vast range of globally distributed providers. This makes the notion that we can construct a conventional national offline legal regulatory process to manage harmful content nonsense. It would amount to either closing the internet or doing nothing about such harmful content.</p><p>Lessons learned</p><p>For 20 years the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has been working with industry to take down illegal images of child sexual abuse online. The lessons of the IWF developed over time, learning as we go, including from our mistakes, have helped us identify the basic principles that could shape an approach to content regulation online. There are five key lessons.</p><p>Content that is deemed to be harmful and which should be removed from the internet should be defined in law and not subject to discretionary, subjective interpretation. For reasons of democracy the process for recommending content removal should be independent of government and political manipulation.</p><p>Though essentially self-regulatory, the actual process for removing content from companies should be independent of individual companies themselves. It should not be left to the individual companies themselves commercial imperatives can too easily shape decisions and, in any case, smaller companies can't afford the review mechanisms larger companies can. Some kind of independent process, with company membership, needs to be established, governed by a majority of independent board members drawn from the relevant stakeholders for the particular type of content being regulated.</p><p>The sheer volume of material means that algorithms will almost certainly have to be used to analyse the mass of content but if potentially questionable material is found, human analysts should make the final recommendations to remove the content. These human analysts should be well trained and supported psychologically and managerially. In addition, there should some system of quality assurance that reviews a selection of recommendations (in the IWF between five and 15 percent are reviewed). This rigorous internal process can be supplemented by an independent audit.</p><p>Any independent body managing content removal recommendations should itself be subject to judicial review to ensure accountability.</p><p>Finally, the independent body and the companies themselves should be transparent about their practice and compliance through the medium of an annual transparency report.</p><p>There is no perfect solution to regulating the internet while ensuring the free flow of information, ideas and opinions and protecting the human rights of users. But it is time to bring the aspiration to deal with bad content down to some practical ideas. The experience of the IWF is a valuable starting point for such a discussion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121851151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFN-33W1-DYTH-G15D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 19, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The founder of Wikipedia took to Twitter after the vote to say that the decision \"empowered monopolistic practices\" and was a blow for internet freedom.</p><p>German Euro-MP Julia Reda, who campaigned vociferously against the reform, also claimed it was a \"dark day for internet freedom\" as Euro-MPs refused to consider a last-ditch bid to amend the reform to exclude the link tax and compulsory content filters.</p><p>\"The new copyright law as it stands threatens a free internet as we know it,\" she argued. \"Algorithms cannot distinguish between actual copyright infringements and the legal re-use of content for purposes such as parody.\"</p><p>Tim Berners Lee, creator of the world wide web, joined Wales in signing an open letter against the move last summer, while musician and Fugees co-founder Wyclef Jean has also spoken out against the reform. In September, he visited Strasbourg and urged Euro-MPs to \"embrace and improve the internet, rather than attempt to block and hinder it\". In a guest column for Politico, he said that he used to worry about fans uploading versions of his work to YouTube. \"It turns out I didn't understand user-generated content back then. We started keeping up these user videos to see what would happen. Subscribers to my YouTube channel increased. More fans were checking out my older work. And all of it meant a new source of revenue for me.\" However, his comments were later attacked by Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry, who argued Jean was arguing on behalf of a company that would take away the livelihood of many of his peers.</p><p>These proposals, which critics claim were \"watered down\" after intense lobbying from technology companies, have largely failed to please anyone. Google, which was one of the main targets of the initial push for widespread copyright change, claimed that while the directive has \"improved\", it will \"still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe's creative and digital economies\".UK technology trade association Tech UK said that the European Parliament \"failed to strike the right balance between protecting copyright and ensuring freedom of expression\".</p><p>Experts predict that technology giants will start to pay their dues from 2021 if there are no further delays.</p><p>The UK, which was the first to lobby for a change in copyright, yesterday said it plans to introduce the laws alongside the rest of Europe even after Brexit. Regardless of whether the UK acts, Europe is sending a clear signal to the technology elite.</p><p>European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who last week handed a \u00a31.28bn fine to Google, summed up European sentiment about big tech in a tweet: \"This is great news.</p><p>Thanks a lot.\"</p><p>FOR Stars such as Sir Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox and James Blunt wanted to take back control of their work from the technology giants</p><p>AGAINST Wyclef Jean changed his tune over YouTube and Facebook when he saw the new audiences his music was reaching; internet founder Sir Tim Berners Lee has warned about the changes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-147732380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRJ-7FC1-DYTY-C03J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Congress hauled the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google up on Capitol Hill the other day, digitally of course. They stand accused of all manner of abuse of power, but mainly (1) using their immense market presence to squeeze competitors and (2) tapping their vast databases to shape Americans\u2019 political, cultural and economic behaviour.  The presumption, shared by Congress and much of the public, which has a long-standing suspicion of power and bigness, is that dealing with the antitrust issues is tantamount to confronting the threats posed by the Internet. But it isn\u2019t. The real threat is the possibility of a mass cyberattack on the nation\u2019s information infrastructure. The Internet is fundamentally a national security problem, which is different from saying it has too much market power.  When I wrote above that \u201cit\u2019s the technology, stupid,\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to be cute. What I meant is that the chief culprit is the nature of the technology itself, not the market power of the top Internet firms.  For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume that Congress or the White House decides to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google into three companies each. I am not saying this is desirable or undesirable, but it would surely transform  the structure. (Disclosure: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) What it would not do is make the world a safer place. Paradoxically, it might make it harder for governments to monitor and regulate the top firms. There would be more firms to watch, and smaller firms with fewer resources might actually become more vulnerable to attack.  To be fair, let\u2019s note that no country has yet suffered a mass cyberattack from a nation or a rogue group that targeted its basic information infrastructure, with the possible exception of Ukraine, attacked by Russia in 2014. Some cyber experts minimise the possibility. It strikes them as melodramatic alarmism. Perhaps they are right.  This is worth repeating: Despite many breaches, none has yet risen to the level of a concerted assault designed to bring daily life to a halt. But the experts could also be wrong. It may be that a mass attack on the United States or some other major target is just a matter of time. What would such an attack look like and feel like? We now have a crude standard of comparison: the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent shutdown of major parts of the economy and society.  The consequences of a massive cyberattack could make the disruptions caused by the pandemic seem like child\u2019s play. There might be simultaneous assaults on the nation\u2019s power, communication, financial and transportation networks. People would stumble about in a cyber-fog with public and private communications channels, from email to cable TV, disabled or overwhelmed.  We are fooling ourselves if we think that breaking up the industry means we are confronting the true threat of the Internet. I have written before that we\u2019d be better off without the Internet \u2014 a suggestion that some regarded as a silly attempt at humour but, though unrealistic, was an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the matter.  My view, then and now, is that all the wonderful things that the Internet allows us to do are potentially offset by the possible costs that it could impose on us. If the industry deserves harsh criticism \u2014 and it does \u2014 it is for downplaying or ignoring the threats posed by this novel and nerve-racking new technology.  Just what should we be doing now to protect ourselves? The choices aren\u2019t good. Switch more and more cyber-traffic to private networks? Build some sort of cyber-wall to filter out more unwanted traffic? All the possibilities come with high costs and many practical problems.  But none is likely until we acknowledge the true nature of our problem. Congress seems a long way from doing that. The congressional appearance of the Big Tech executives gave some indication of the gap. Most Democratic members and some Republicans were having too much fun beating up Big Tech. It\u2019s a traditional role, but it\u2019s now outdated.

In the time since, Facebook has continued to be rocked by scandals: privacy breaches, livestreamed terrorist attacks, harassment, and more. At the same time, competition regulators[2], scholars and technologists have stepped up calls for Facebook to create and/or adopt interoperability standards to open up its messenger products (and others) to competitors. To make matters more complex, there is an increasing appetite[3] in both the USA[4] and Europe[5], to hold Facebook and other online services directly accountable for the actions of its users: both in terms of what those users make available (copyright infringement, political extremism, incitements to violence, etc) and in how they treat each other (harassment, stalking, etc). Fool me twice Facebook execs have complained that these goals are in conflict: they say that for the company to detect and block undesirable user behaviors as well as interdicting future Cambridge Analytica-style data-hijacking, they need to be able to observe and analyze everything every user does, both to train automated filters and to allow them to block abusers. </p><p>By allowing third parties to both inject data into their network and pull data out of it\u2014that is, allowing interoperability\u2014the company's ability to monitor and control its users' bad behavior will be weakened. There is a good deal of truth to this, but buried in that truth is a critical (and highly debatable) assumption: \"If you believe that Facebook has the will and ability to stop 2.3 billion people from abusing its systems and each other, then weakening Facebook's control over these 2.3 billion people might limit the company's ability to make that happen.\" But if there's one thing we've learned from more than a decade of Facebook scandals, it's that there's little reason to believe that Facebook possesses the requisite will and capabilities. Indeed, it may be that there is no automated system or system of human judgments that could serve as a moderator and arbiter of the daily lives of billions of people. Given Facebook's ambition to put more and more of our daily lives behind its walled garden, it's hard to see why we would ever trust Facebook to be the one to fix all that's wrong with Facebook. After all, Facebook's moderation efforts to date[6] have been a mess of backfiring, overblocking, and self-censorship, a \"solution\" that no one is happy with. Which is why interoperability is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to addressing the very real harms of market concentration in the tech sector, including Facebook's dominance over social media. Facebook users are eager for alternatives to the service[7], but are held back by the fact that the people they want to talk with are all locked within the company's walled garden. Interoperability presents a means for people to remain partially on Facebook, but while using third-party tools that are designed to respond to their idiosyncratic needs. While it seems likely that no one is able to build a single system that protects 2.3 billion users, it's certainly possible to build a service whose social norms and technological rules are suited to smaller groups[8]. Facebook can't figure out how to serve every individual's and community's needs -- but those individuals and communities might be able to do so for themselves, especially if they get to choose which toolsmith's tools they use to mediate their Facebook experience. Standards-washing: the lesson of Bush v Gore But not all interoperability is created equal. Companies have historically shown themselves to be more than capable of subverting mandates to adhere to standards and allow for interconnection. A good historic example of this is the drive to standardize voting machines in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v Gore. Ambiguous results from voting machines resulted in an election whose outcome had to be determined by the Supreme Court, which led to Congress passing the Help America Vote Act[9], which mandated standards for voting machines. The ensuing process included a top-tier standards development organization to oversee the work: the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which set about creating a standard for voting machines. But rather than creating a \"performance standard\" describing how a voting machine should process ballots, the industry sneakily tried to get the IEEE to create a \"design standard\" that largely described the machines they'd already sold to local election officials. In other words, rather than using standards to describe how a good voting machine should work, the industry pushed a standard that described how their existing, flawed machines did work[10] with some small changes in configurations. Had they succeeded, they could have simply slapped a \"complies with IEEE standard\" label on everything they were already selling and declared themselves to have fixed the problem... without making the serious changes needed to fix their systems, including requiring a voter-verified paper ballot. Big Tech is even more concentrated than the voting machine industry is, and it's far more concentrated than the voting machine industry was in 2003 (most industries are more concentrated today than they were in 2003). Legislatures, courts or regulators that seek to define \"interoperability\" should be aware of the real risk of the definition being hijacked by the dominant players (who are already very skilled at subverting standardization processes[11]). Any interoperability standard developed without recognizing Facebook's current power and interest is at risk of standardizing the parts of Facebook's business that it does not view as competitive risks, while leaving the company's core business (and its bad business practices) untouched. Even if we do manage to impose interoperability on Facebook in ways that allow for meaningful competition, in the absence of robust anti-monopoly rules, the ecosystem that grows up around that new standard is likely to view everything that's not a standardized interoperable component as a competitive advantage, something that no competitor should be allowed to make incursions upon, on pain of a lawsuit for violating terms of service[12] or infringing a patent[13] or reverse-engineering a copyright lock[14] or even more nebulous claims like \"tortious interference with contract.\" Everything not forbidden is mandatory In other words, the risk of trusting competition to an interoperability mandate is that it will create a new ecosystem where everything that's not forbidden is mandatory, freezing in place the current situation, in which Facebook and the other giants dominate and new entrants are faced with onerous compliance burdens that make it more difficult to start a new service, and limit those new services to interoperating in ways that are carefully designed to prevent any kind of competitive challenge. Standards should be the floor on interoperability, but adversarial interoperability[15] should be the ceiling. Adversarial interoperability takes place when a new company designs a product or service that works with another company's existing products or services, without seeking permission to do so. Facebook is a notorious opponent of adversarial interoperability. In 2008, Facebook successfully wielded a radical legal theory[16] that allowed it to shut down Power Ventures, a competitor that allowed Facebook's users to use multiple social networks from a single interface. Facebook argued that by allowing users to log in and display Facebook with a different interface, even after receipt of a cease and desist letter telling Power Ventures to stop, the company had broken a Reagan-era anti-hacking law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In other words, upsetting Facebook's investors made their conduct illegal. Adversarial interoperability flips the script Clearing this legal thicket would go a long way toward allowing online communities to self-govern by federating their discussions with Facebook without relying on Facebook's privacy tools and practices. Software vendors could create tools that allowed community members to communicate in private, using encrypted messages that are unintelligible to Facebook's data-mining tools, but whose potential members could still discover and join the group using Facebook. This could allow new entrants to flip the script on Facebook's \"network effects\" advantage. Today, Facebook is viewed as holding all the cards because it has corralled everyone who might join a new service within its walled garden. But legal reforms to safeguard the right to adversarial interoperability would turn this on its head: Facebook would be the place that had conveniently organized all the people whom you might tempt to leave Facebook, and even supply you with the tools you need to target those people. Revenge of Carterfone There is good historic precedent for using a mix of interoperability mandates and a legal right to interoperate beyond those mandates to reduce monopoly power. The FCC has imposed a series of interoperability obligations on incumbent phone companies: for example, the rules that allow phone subscribers to choose their own long-distance carriers. At the same time, federal agencies and courts have also stripped away many of the legal tools[17] that phone companies once used to punish third parties who plugged gear into their networks[18]. The incumbent telecom companies historically argued that they couldn't maintain a reliable phone network if they didn't get to specify which devices were connected to it, a position that also allowed the companies to extract rental payments for home phones[19] for decades, selling you the same phone dozens or even hundreds of times over. When agencies and courts cleared the legal thicket around adversarial interoperability in the phone network, it did not mean that the phone companies had to help new entrants connect stuff to their wires: manufacturers of modems, answering machines, and switchboards sometimes had to contend with technical changes in the Bell system that broke their products. Sometimes, this was an accident of some unrelated technical administration of the system; sometimes it seemed like a deliberate bid to harm a competitor. Often, it was ambiguous. Monopolists don't have a monopoly on talent But it turns out that you don't need the phone company's cooperation to design a device that works with its system. Careful reverse-engineering and diligent product updates meant that even devices that the phone companies hated -- devices that eroded their most profitable markets -- had long and profitable runs in the market, with devoted customers. Those customers are key to the success of adversarial interoperators. Remember that the audience for a legitimate adversarial interoperability product are the customers of the existing service that it connects to. Anything that the Bell system did to block third-party phone devices ultimately punished the customers who bought those devices, creating ill will. And when a critical mass of an incumbent giant's customer base depends on\u2014and enjoys\u2014a competitor's product, even the most jealous and uncooperative giants are often convinced to change tactics and support the businesses they've been trying to destroy. In a competitive market (which adversarial interoperability can help to bring into existence), even very large companies can't afford to enrage their customers. Is Facebook better than everyone else? Facebook is one of the largest companies in the world. Many of the world's most talented engineers and security experts already work there, and many others aspire to do so. Given that, is it realistic to think that a would-be adversarial interoperator could design a service that plugs into Facebook without Facebook's permission? Ultimately, this is not a question with an empirical answer. It's true that few have tried to pull this off since Power Ventures was destroyed by Facebook litigation, but it's not clear whether the competitive vacuum is the result of potential competitors being too timid to lock engineering horns with Facebook's brain-trust, or potential competitors and investors whose legal departments won't let them even try. But it is instructive to look at the history of the Bell system after Carterfone and Hush-a-Phone: though the Bell system was the single biggest employer of telephone technicians in the world, and represented the best, safest, highest-paid opportunities for would-be telecoms innovators, after Carterfone and Hush-a-Phone, Bell's rivals proceeded to make device after device after device that extended the capabilities of the phone network, without permission, overcoming the impediments that the network's operator put in their way. Closer to home, remember that when Facebook wanted to get Power Ventures out of its network, its primary tool of choice wasn't technical measures -- Facebook didn't (or couldn't) use API changes or firewall rules alone to keep Power Ventures off the service -- it was mainly lawsuits[20]. Perhaps that's because Facebook wanted to set an example for later challengers by winning a definitive legal battle, but it's very telling that the company that operated the network didn't (or couldn't!) just kick its rival out, and instead went through a lengthy, expensive and risky legal battle when simple IP blocking didn't work. Facebook has a lot of talented engineers, but it doesn't have all of them. Being a defender is hard Facebook's problem with would-be future challengers is a familiar one: in security, it is easier to attack than to defend. For Facebook to keep a potential competitor off its network, it has to make no mistakes. In order for a third party to bypass Facebook's defenses in order to interoperate with Facebook without permission, it has only to find and exploit a single mistake. Facebook labors under other constraints: like the Bell system fending off Hush-a-Phone, the things that Facebook does to make life hard for competitors who are helping its users get more out of its service, are also making life harder for all its users. For example, any tripwire that blocks logins by suspected bots will also block users whose behaviors appear bot-like: the more strict the bot-detector is, the more actual humans it will catch. Here again, Facebook's dizzying scale works against it: with billions of users, a one-in-a-million event is going to happen thousands of times every day, so Facebook has to accommodate a wide variety of use-cases, and some of those behaviors will be sufficiently weird to allow a rival's bot to slip through. Back to privacy Facebook users (and even non-Facebook users[21]) who want more privacy have a variety of options, none of them very good. Users can tweak Facebook's famously hard-to-understand privacy dashboard to lock down their accounts and bet that Facebook will honor their settings (this has not always been a good bet[22]). Everyone can use tracker-blockers[23], ad-blockers and script-blockers to prevent Facebook from tracking them when they're not on Facebook, by watching how they interact with pages that have Facebook \"Like\" buttons and other beacons that let Facebook monitor activity elsewhere on the Internet. We're rightfully proud of our own tracker blocker, Privacy Badger, but it doesn't stop Facebook from tracking you if you have a Facebook account and you're using Facebook's service. Facebook users can also watch what they say on Facebook, hoping that they won't slip up and put something compromising on the service that will come back to haunt them (though this isn't always easy to predict[24]). But even if people do all this, they're still exposing themselves to Facebook's scrutiny when they use Facebook, which monitors how they use the service, every click and mouse-movement. What's more, anyone using a Facebook mobile app might be exposing themselves to incredibly intrusive data-gathering, including some surprisingly creepy and underhanded tactics[25]. If users could use a third-party service to exchange private messages with friends, or to participate in a group they're a member of, they can avoid much (but not all) of this surveillance. Such a tool would allow someone to use Facebook while minimizing how they are used by Facebook. For people who want to leave Facebook but whose friends, colleagues or fellow travelers are not ready to join them, a service like this could let Facebook vegans get out of the Facebook pool while still leaving a toe in its waters. What's more, it lets their friends follow them, by creating alternatives to Facebook where the people they want to talk to are still reachable. One user at a time, Facebook's rivals could siphon off whole communities. As Facebook's market power dwindled, so would the pressure that web publishers feel to embed Facebook trackers on their sites, so that non-Facebook users would not be as likely to be tracked as they use the Web. Third-party tools could automate the process of encrypting conversations, allowing users to communicate in private without having to trust Facebook's promises about its security. Finally, such a system would put real competitive pressure on Facebook. Today, Facebook's scandals do not trigger mass departures from the service, and when users do leave, they tend to end up on Instagram[26], which is also owned by Facebook. But if there was a constellation of third-party services that were constantly carving escape hatches in Facebook's walled garden, Facebook would have to contend with the very real possibility that a scandal could result in the permanent departure of its users. Just the possibility would change the way that Facebook made decisions: product designers and other internal personnel who argued for treating users with respect on ethical grounds would be able to add an instrumental benefit to being \"good guys\": failing to do so could trigger yet another exodus from the platform. Lower and upper bounds It's clear that online services need rules about privacy[27] and interoperability setting out how they should treat their users, including those users who want to use a competing service. The danger is that these rules will become the ceiling on competition and privacy, rather than the floor. For users who have privacy needs -- and other needs -- beyond those the big platforms are willing to fulfill, it's important that we keep the door open to competitors (for-profit, nonprofit, hobbyist and individuals) who are willing to fill those needs. None of this means that we should have an online free-for-all. A rival of Facebook that bypassed its safeguards to raid user data should still get in trouble (just as Facebook should get in trouble for privacy violations, inadequate security, or other bad activity). Shouldering your way into Facebook in order to break the law is, and should remain, illegal, and the power of the courts and even law enforcement should remain a check on those activities. But helping Facebook's own users, or the users of any big service, to configure their experience to make their lives better should be legal and encouraged even (and especially) if it provides a path for users to either diversify their social media experience or move away entirely from the big, concentrated services. Either way, we'd be on our way to a more pluralistic, decentralized, diverse Internet.

We're going to get started. Okay. My name is Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley's media analyst. I'm excited to welcome back IPG. The man to my left is Michael Roth, Chairman and CEO. For those who may not be aware, Interpublic is one of the world's premier advertising and marketing services companies, owning agencies like McCann, FCB and MullenLowe. Michael, thanks for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL ISOR ROTH, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.: Good to be here. The premier agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Right.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Not one of.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Not. Right. Exactly. Welcome to the premier conference. And then a lot going on. I wanted to maybe start, obviously, a lot of uncertainty going on with the macro front, particularly concerns over how the virus might impact sort of business confidence and spending. Where would you -- how would you tell us to think about the volatility we're seeing in the market and what it might mean for your business as you look out over the course of the year?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, obviously, there's concern, particularly with conferences like the one we're at right now. And we've seen somewhat of an impact. Obviously, we're in the conference business. Jack Morton does conferences and events. And we've seen some pullback there. But I think you have to look at the overall positioning of our company.</p><p>In China, we were affected like everyone else, and it represents 2% of our business. And if you look at the project parts of our business, again, it's less than 2% of our business. So overall, we don't see a material impact to our businesses.</p><p>Now when it -- when issues on supply chains and things like that come into play, then obviously, there's some level of concern. But right now, we have not seen anything like that. And in the past, when we had SARS and Ebola, it was a short-term impact. And frankly, our business came back after that. So we're hoping that's the same here.</p><p>And I just think what we have to do is just be -- we're concerned about our employees. So in those locations, our employees are working from home. Our clients and our suppliers are doing the same. And business continues. And we just hope this is a short-term issue for us.</p><p>But if you look at our overall business, 70% of our business comes from -- 62% from the United States and another 8% from the U.K. So I think we're very well-positioned with respect to our geographic reach and protecting us from the exposure.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Imagine the project, this is probably pretty Q4-heavy, right, within that 2%?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Exactly. And a lot of the projects, what we're seeing is some large projects are going to be broken up and done regionally in a different time of the year. So I think we'll see some recovery there. And some of our clients have already made statements that although the -- like in China, they're seeing an adverse impact on their e-commerce business. But they're comfortable that once we're through this, that business will come back. So I'm cautiously optimistic, but obviously, there's areas of concern out there that we have to be careful about.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: It feels like you reported your year-end like years ago.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: I know, exactly.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: But you had another strong year, the business accelerating. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the relative share that you guys have been consistently picking up, even through account losses? What's driving that? In particular, talk about your media and kind of the data side of the business where you've made some acquisitions. How is that all helping you guys continue to grow faster than your peers and your competitors?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, yes, as you pointed out, we continue to beat our sector, both in terms of organic growth and margin. And we were particularly proud of our fourth quarter. We saw -- particularly in the United States, a recovery in the United States. So -- and it was pretty much strong across the board. Obviously, our media business continued to perform extremely well. But in the fourth quarter, we saw our global networks, McCann, FCB, MullenLowe, contribute as well as our CMG assets in terms of Octagon and Jack Morton. So it was pretty much across the board and, frankly, across sectors that we saw positive results, so we are excited about that coming into 2020.</p><p>Clearly, the acquisition of Acxiom, when we did the acquisition of Acxiom, I said that we thought it was going to be a game changer in terms of positioning our company, having a competitive advantage. And we, in fact, have seen already contributions by Acxiom. And the follow-up, we formed Kinesso, where we took some of the parts of Acxiom and coupled with parts of media brands to create Kinesso, which has martech, ad tech and services altogether, providing some value-based offerings, which we'll talk about later.</p><p>But we've seen an impact there, not only with our existing clients, but they certainly added to our new business wins and expanding client opportunities, when we bring all the different collaborative agencies we have on an open-architecture basis.</p><p>And I've said this on the call, this is the first time that I believe that there is a clear distinction between the holding companies in terms of the go-to-market strategy. It used to be all the holding companies had the same assets, the same great brands and so on. I think one of the main reasons that we're outperforming is that our go-to-market strategy is different. And that is we use the open-architecture model, where we bring in the best of IPG. We support our brands. We don't put all of our brands together. And we collaborate by bringing these brands together to meet the needs of our clients. So sitting at the table, we have Kinesso, we have media brands, we have Weber Shandwick, we have Golin, we have McCann, FCB, MullenLowe, all the different assets that can help our clients move the needle on a collaborative open-architecture basis. And it's resonating extremely well with our clients.</p><p>So I think the fact that this go-to-market strategy basically puts our money where our mouth is in terms of offering a distinction between us and our competitors and quality offerings is paying off. And I think that's one of the primary reasons we've been outperforming.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Is that, in your mind, a barrier? Is that -- are there barriers to replicating that, another holding company?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Apparently, they must -- it must be because I've been talking about open architecture now for 14 years, when we first put the management team together. So it's not a secret in terms of our go-to-market strategy. We just apparently know how to do it better than others. And our competitors, their definition of open architectures, they just put their businesses together and they call it by a single name. And that's not what open architecture is. Open architecture is collaborative, where our best of our agencies work together. They have their own go-to-market strategy. They have their own identity, the quality, creative capabilities. And apparently, it is hard to replicate because we seem to be the only ones doing it.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Where are you guys investing this year? You guys guided to 20 basis points of margin expansion. I mean to some extent, you kind of spoiled us over the years with more than that. But the margins have -- you've really closed that gap with the peers. But where are you guys reinvesting back in the business? And is the competition for talent driving up -- extends it a little bit, all else equal?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: No. I think the issue -- look, eventually, you can't keep expanding margin at 40 to 50 basis points. I'd like to, and who knows maybe we will. It's a business mix issue in terms of where you get your revenue. But we put together our guidance for the year. I might also add that when we put together our guidance for the year in terms of the 3% organic, we had been fairly conservative in terms of setting our guidance. So there is a built-in conservatism in that number.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Some cushion.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: I don't like to call it a cushion. I like to call it conservatism, so that we have some leeway. So to the extent there is some exposure on this coronavirus, hopefully, we may have that covered in there as long it's a short-term focus.</p><p>But when we do that, we look at our business mix, and one of the things we're doing with Kinesso is we're bringing out new products. And these products are very value-based products. And the compensation for these products is based on the value created and therefore, it carries with it higher margins. So to the extent we roll out these new products and other products that we have in our other businesses, to the extent we're successful with that, we expect to see added margin as a result of that. So we were conservative on the margin number, and 2020 is just beginning.</p><p>So talk to me later on in the year in terms of our ability to expand it. But we don't view that we peaked out in terms of our margin expansion. It's a variable cost model, and we see efficiencies. We've sold -- we had a number of dispositions in 2019, where we saw that in certain markets we were competing in, we didn't have to own those businesses, we can have affiliations. So we disposed of those businesses. And we'll take another -- we continue to look at deficiencies throughout the year. So we'll see some of those in 2020 as well.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: I was planning to ask you about the health care vertical anyway, it just so happened, which I think was one of your strongest last year. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the trends in that sector that's driving growth for your business. Why are you guys so well positioned in that vertical? And then why don't we start there? And we'll go from there.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, health care has grown to 27% of our business, which is pretty impressive. Actually, for 2019, it was not our best-performing sector. Our retail and financial service sector actually performed better. But that said, it was a very high-performing sector for us. And it's a great example of the open architecture. We have multiple agencies that have great global expertise in health care. McCann Health, FCB, Weber Shandwick, media brands, a couple of our independents, whether it be Deutsche or Hill Holiday, have unique consumer health care expertise. And included in that world of expertise within IPG, we have Med Ad, we have farmer, we have consumer. We have professionals by disease, by discipline. So we really cover the gamut of what our clients need.</p><p>And some of our best open-architecture structures are in the global health care side. And I can tell you how rewarding it is to sit at these top to tops with these clients and have FCB, McCann, Mediabrands, Weber Shandwick and Golin, all sitting around the table, working on a particular client, and the client not even know which agencies everyone works for, focused on it.</p><p>So the health care expertise that we bring to the table as well as the data capabilities that we have in health care is best-in-class, and it's really resonating in the global marketplace. So we're pretty excited about what we bring to the table there and using open architecture in that environment. It's pencils down when you get through these reviews because the capabilities that we bring are just incredible.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: You must have implemented an incentive structure at IPG and in particular, health care, that incents people to collaborate across agencies that don't have to worry about their own P&amp;L or their own comp.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Yes. I mean that's what open architecture is all about. In fact, one of our major open-architecture health care clients, we actually have a separate P&amp;L, we have a separate incentive plan for those individuals, and they work for different agencies. So the old days of my silo, and what does this mean to my silo is starting to disappear. And it's very client-centric. And our people -- and the reason we do it so well is because our people realize that we're going to be -- they're going to be rewarded on their performance, not whether it goes into their own agency silo or not.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Let's just talk about Acxiom. And I promise we're not going to spend the whole time with that. Otherwise, you'll get upset. But it was a significant acquisition for the company. It seems to be performing as or better than you guys had expected. Where are you today on the integration process? And when you think about new business activity, how much are you leveraging the Acxiom assets?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, the integration is basically done. And the real -- the ultimate test of an integration is incentive comp. And we just got through Board meetings on our incentive comps and roll the incentive plans, and everything went pretty smoothly in terms of that. So the infrastructure integration, the financial systems, but more importantly, the go-to-market strategies have been pretty well-established right now. So there's really not much more we can do with respect to the integration. And it's quite an accomplishment to be able to do that in 1 year. So we're really proud of our teams for doing that.</p><p>And when you look at Acxiom, when we did the acquisition, what we said was 2/3 of the Acxiom business is, first, part of data management. And they're the best-in-class in doing that. And they represent 50 of the top 100 Fortune 100 companies.</p><p>So that business continues to do well. As I said on the call, they performed as expected, certainly based on our business plans for them, probably a little bit better than that. And so we're really pleased with not just the integration, but the business performance of Acxiom. The other 1/3 of their business is in the info base side, which is where we had more experience with them working before the acquisition.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: That's third-party data?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: That's the third-party data. And that basically is utilized in connection with the Kinesso and AMP third-party data. And it's that where we use that third-party data in connection with the capabilities of Kinesso in terms of bringing the activation, the services, the applications of the data that we have from Acxiom to life within Kinesso and offering these new products. So we're very pleased with the performance of both Acxiom and Kinesso, and they've made a definite impact in new business wins as well as servicing open-architecture platforms with our existing clients. And when you sit in a room and you see the capabilities that they bring to the table, working with our creative capabilities and our PR capabilities in addition to media, I mean, it's really what this business is all about.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Yes. I think when you guys closed on the deal, I could be wrong, I think about 90% of the business was domestic or U.S. Are you guys having any success? Or is there a big push to try expand their revenue base?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: It was clearly on our agenda in terms of opportunities with Acxiom. There were 2 parts of the opportunity -- 3 parts of the opportunity for Acxiom that we were looking at. One are these new services, which I referred to in the Kinesso offering, and we have a certain amount of revenue synergies already baked into our plans for 2020, and we're rolling that out, principally on our media brands clients. And then next year, we'll start rolling that out to our creative agencies as well.</p><p>The other opportunities are in the sectors. We're at 27% in health care. Frankly, they're more financial service-oriented than health care. So we see that as an opportunity. So we're starting to introduce Acxiom to our very strong global health care client base. So they're being brought in to see what they can provide. And we're also starting to see some project-based opportunities there. And then the final expansion would be on the global footprint. And we're not quite there yet. But again, in these open architecture structures that are on global clients, we are introducing Acxiom and Kinesso. So we see that on the horizon as well. So we're quite pleased with the transaction. And I do believe it will continue to be transformational to our business and really gives us a competitive advantage.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: You've mentioned it a number of times, and I meant to ask you, but I want to ask for those of us who are not in your business, Kinesso? The agency business loves rolling out new fancy names with big fanfare, and this is clearly important to your business. So explain to us why you guys created it, what it does? Is it a media set of products? How does it fit into the client...</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: It's actually a combination. Think of Kinesso as parts of media brands, parts of Acxiom and other parts of our business, service-oriented part of the business where they do -- they can do insights. They can do media plans. They do applications, and they do activation. You're familiar with Cadreon, which is our programmatic side of the business. Acxiom -- Kinesso houses now Cadreon. It's run by Arun. And Arun brings unique capabilities to bring all these assets together. And it's thought process of creating Kinesso was candidly in the marketplace, the market didn't view advertising agencies as having the technology, the martech or, ad tech capabilities that maybe some other third parties are out there. So we felt by creating a new entity, giving it a fancy name that doesn't sound like an advertising company, we will be viewed in the marketplace as frankly more of a technology company than an advertising. And Acxiom is not an agency either. So -- and it's really resonating quite well in the marketplace, and it's growing significantly.</p><p>So, so far, it's working as intended. But more importantly, the output and the capabilities that they bring to the table are just mind-boggling. You can see what they can deliver in terms of insights and reaching the consumers, the right consumers with the right message and the analytics that goes into that. And if you look at our client base, they're some of the top analytic companies in the world, and it is resonating with those clients, which is pretty impressive when you can impress those clients.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Sure. Let's talk a little about sort of the new business activity. A couple of years ago, we had sort of what seemed to be a highly elevated level. How would you describe the current pace? And then also, can you just talk a little bit about when -- how we should think about this year in terms of account loss headwinds that you're working through?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, we're still cycling through the losses that we had in 2019. And as I said at the call, in the first quarter, we still have headwinds. In the U.S., it will be close to 4% overall, so like 3-change-percent. And then they will go down to about 1% or less than 1% overall in the second quarter, and then we'll be through the headwinds.</p><p>I might add that our performance in 2019, the 3.3% organic growth was net of those headwinds, so in case I didn't tell you that. So the performance was that much more impressive when you factor in the headwinds that we had. But -- so we'll cycle through those headwinds by the second half of the year of 2020. And Mediapalooza was a couple of years ago. So everyone was expecting a lot of new pitches out there. We haven't seen a lot of them.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: No. Why do you think that is?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, candidly, some of our contracts we've renewed, which is always the best way to do it.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: They could have taken them...</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: They could have gone out and review it, but they're so happy with the services they're getting from us that they've been renewed.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: But I think at the industry level, it's maybe a little bit less manic deals?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, we'll see. I mean anecdotally, there are a number of big pitches that are coming. We hope it's not from our clients. So it will be opportunities for us. But we make it a point of working with our existing clients, so that when the time comes, when our expiration of our contracts, that we would be able to sign them and renew them. So you don't read about that in the papers. And the reviews that we did have in '19, we were pretty much successful on. So -- but I haven't -- right now, frankly, the only big media pitch that I'm aware of is Diageo, and we're not participating in that by our choice. And so we got a lot to grow this year. So hopefully, we'll see a lot of more opportunities for us.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Got it. I've got a few more questions, but I want to make sure the audience has an opportunity. So if you have a question for Michael, please raise your hand and wait for a microphone.</p><p>Before we do that, just on the media side of the business, in this conference, we've got the Googles and a lot of the big platforms, media platforms. Where do you see the incremental ad dollar going these days? And how are marketers dealing with the declines of television ratings, which have really -- I don't know, they've been there, but they're sort of accelerating to the downside lately.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, I mean, the ratings have gone down, but pricing hasn't. All right. So the -- again, the dollars are going to trace -- track content. And if the content is good, then the dollars are going to be allocated there. And frankly, for us, that's good because you need someone to help navigate through all of this. But there's no question that with the advent of all these different OTT platforms that are out there, there are real opportunities to reach the consumers in efficient and novel ways.</p><p>And we add value, both with respect to the arrangements we have with those providers, the knowledge we have and the insights that we can bring to our clients to show them where their dollars are best spent, whether it's Facebook or Google or AT&amp;T or Comcast, NBCUniversal. There are so many different outlets there that clients need the agnostic, independent view of where they should spend their media dollars, and we can add value in that regard.</p><p>And so this is -- this all bodes well for our business. But it also bodes well for our clients because the opportunity to reach that consumer based on a data-driven offering is compelling.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Yes. Does the fragmentation of audiences slow down this trend towards in-housing that we've been seeing a lot of?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, it depends on what they're in-housing. The big thing of in-housing was programmatic. So we actually helped our clients' in-house programmatic. And why? Because, frankly, you need some unique capabilities to do it, but more importantly, they need the insights that go with it. And that's where we add the value. So you're not going to see clients developing internal capabilities that have the breadth and insights that we bring to the table. And to the extent they bring it in-house, that's fine, but they're still going to need our input. And any time you get us in front of the client, we can add value and show how the services we provide can enhance their ROI. And that's what we have to do.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Yes. Go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: While we're on the subject, there's a lot of regulatory scrutiny or shall I say, political scrutiny of the big tech platforms. And if you kind of parse out the projects and the more tangible business critique, one thing that emerges is questioning the vertical integration of advertising inventory and the buying tools, if you like, the exchanges that are often vertically integrated.</p><p>For an outsider, it's very hard to judge whether this integration just occurred historically and is like value neutral, or there's some kind of over-earning going on. So if there was to be an unbundling of ad tech platforms that are currently owned by those big tech firms and the inventory that they sell through that, is that sort of a needle moving big, good news for you guys? Or are you just sort of a tool is a tool is a tool?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, we -- a number of years ago, we were the first ones in our industry to unpack that and provide the transparency. We do not take inventory. And we're transparent with respect to our clients that we only buy inventory on behalf of our clients. So you will not see us selling inventory-owned. And frankly, that is one of the reasons that we have the relationship with our clients and the fact that our media business is performing so well because we are a trusted adviser. Our economics are open to our clients. They know where we're making our money, how we're making our money. And when you go to these value offerings that I was talking about, it's all based on trust and transparency in terms of how you determine that. So I do believe that the lack of transparency in some of these platforms does not bode well for them because it raises an issue of this black box, where is there money going, how much are they paying for it, and why, in fact, aren't they getting the transparency that they should get.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Maybe connected with that. There's a lot of technical, as far as I understand it anyway, there's a lot of technical changes that sort of degrade target ability of a digital inventory buyer and external third-party, whereas cookie is being degraded as an instrument of targeting. And it sort of feels like it prioritizes logged-in platforms at the expense of an independent third party, which is some of the spend that you represent. How do you think about that? Is that a meaningful headwind and especially given that you bought some assets that were built in the cookie world, if you like?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, look, I think what you're saying is the -- I think what clients have to leverage is their own first-party data. The richest audience they have is their own data, which is why Acxiom is such an important part of the future of what we do. Think of the power of really analyzing and cleansing first-party data for major corporations, where they can target their own clients, their own customers with a message that is consistent with the likes and dislikes of that particular customer. So you don't have to go through all these other walled gardens, if you will. And we see the opportunity to leverage that first-party data as a critical component of maximizing the return on investment for our clients, which is one of the reasons we bought Acxiom.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Did you have one right back there? Same question, a popular question. Go ahead. To the back, Michael, right there. There you go. Okay.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON, FOUNDING PARTNER &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, MOFFETTNATHANSON LLC: Just on the potential slowdown with corona. What areas of spend, be it TV, outdoor, digital, we should expect to see any impact come through first?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Yes. I wish I knew the answer to that. Well, in our case, it's the events, the outdoor stuff, conferences such as this, things like that. We already know that there's some global conferences that have been canceled. We provide the services for those conferences. So that's the first impact that we're going to see. In terms of allocating media, where it's going to affect, frankly, I can't really answer that. But if they're working at home -- we had this conversation in one of our breakout sessions. If everyone starts working at home, we do have the ability to reach everyone in terms of the consumers at home, which is -- which will go to the digital allocation of media because we'll have a better way of finding where they are and what they're doing and getting messages to them. But that's kind of a layman's view of that. I would have to defer to my experts in that side of the business to answer it, but that's just the gut reaction to it.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Probably got time for one more if there is one out there. Maybe I'll wrap up, Michael. You guys announced a dividend increase, high single digits in that zone, 9%? 8%. It was that?</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Yes, I was pushing for 10%, but we will settle for 9%.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Right? But that just seems to be a more consistent part of your capital allocation philosophy. Maybe just talk about why you guys feel dividend growth is important to the business and the investors and sort of the free cash flow outlook for the company.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Well, any company looks at free cash flow. And the first place to look is reinvesting in our business, which we do. And we don't see any big transactions out there that we need to do from an acquisition point of view. So the excess cash belongs to our shareholders. And the only remaining question is do you do it in the form of dividend increase or do you do it in the form of buybacks? Because of the Acxiom transaction, we have debt on our balance sheet, which since acquisition, we paid down about $500 million of it. So our goal is to start paying that down, continue to pay that down.</p><p>So we're back at the levels where we're comfortable with from investment-grade, pre-Acxiom, if you will, and get back to a stage, probably sometime next year, where we can look at both buybacks and dividends in terms of how we allocate our cash to our investors. And frankly, the best source of where that goes is from our investors. So we meet with our investors, we get their views on whether they prefer buybacks versus dividends. And we take action. But the important point is that our free cash flow belongs to our shareholders. And that's -- I think if you look at the history of IPG, that's what we, in fact, have done. We've returned over $4 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Okay. Well, that's a good thing to note -- end on. Thank you, everybody.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Thank you.</p><p>BENJAMIN DANIEL SWINBURNE: Thanks, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL ISOR ROTH: Good to be here.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

But Orszag, now a Citi vice chairman pulling in a respectable $US4 million salary, took to the stage of the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton on the Park to demolish the central thesis of the superstar French economist Thomas Piketty.</p><p>Piketty's blockbuster book Capital catalogues how the owners of capital have seized a bigger share of the economic pie compared with labour.</p><p>Orszag's story - as published in a new study last week with Jason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisors - is different.</p><p>Yes, inequality in incomes is rising.</p><p>But not because bosses are universally screwing workers.</p><p>The increase in income inequality has been driven primarily by the spectacular performance of certain \"superstar\" US firms.</p><p>Orszag calls these companies \"rocket ships\". They mostly comprise the big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, and big pharmaceutical companies. These increasingly globalised firms have been enjoying sustained and extraordinary returns.</p><p>In the 1960s, the top 10 per cent of firms by return on invested capital enjoyed returns of around 10 per cent a year. Today, the top 10 per cent of firms are enjoying annual returns of 100 per cent.</p><p>And those blockbuster returns are not fleeting. Of firms in the top 10 per cent by performance in 2003, 85 per cent were still in the top 10 per cent in 2013.</p><p>\"The rocket ships are not just going up and crashing, they are going up and continuing to go up,\" Orszag said. That good fortune spills over into higher wages for tech and pharma employees.</p><p>\"Anyone at that firm is doing great; if you're not at that firm, not so much.\"</p><p>Sure, chief executives are still richer than their employees. But mid-level employees at Facebook have been getting richer quicker than comparable employees at US manufacturing firms.</p><p>Inequality has been rising between firms, not within them.</p><p>\"It may be that we have dramatically mischaracterised a lot of what's driving increasing inequality in the US,\" Orszag said.</p><p>If we want to stop the rise in inequality - which recent studies have suggested has become harmful to economic growth - we need to focus on what is driving the super profits of some firms.</p><p>Usually, you'd expect competition to erode such super normal returns.</p><p>But this hasn't happened for the tech and pharma giants.</p><p>Perhaps they're just wonderful companies, run by excellent managers who make better decisions than their competitors.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>A more likely explanation is that these companies benefit in some way from a lack of competition.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies obviously benefit from the awarding of patent rights, which gives them the incentive to develop new technologies. Perhaps that incentive is larger than it needs to be.</p><p>But how to explain the monopolistic hue of large tech companies?</p><p>One would think the world of technology is fast moving, with little barriers to entry.</p><p>But many of the big tech companies operate in markets which exhibit a unique \"winner takes all\" character, giving rise to natural monopolies.</p><p>Facebook benefits from being the biggest entrenched social network. Similarly, Google benefits from being the biggest and most recognisable search engine.</p><p>In this sense, they are natural monopolies, much like the copper wires that Telstra owns that go to your house or the poles and wires of electricity companies.</p><p>Monopolists are able to extract \"rents\": returns above what would be needed to keep them in business. That's bad, because it usually means consumers pay higher prices than others.</p><p>Monopolists then divert some of their profits into lobbying government to set the rules of the game even further in their favour, a process known as \"rent seeking\". Hello, Gina.</p><p>If we want to tackle inequality, Orszag prescribes a greater focus on anti-trust and competition policy.</p><p>Interestingly, he also flags housing policy as an important tool to tackle inequality.</p><p>Basically, people need to be able to afford to live near the rocket ship companies to get on board.</p><p>\"If the price of a house is extraordinarily expensive in the rocket ship areas, because wages have been bid up there, it is very difficult for you to move into that local labour market and up your chances of being able to hop on to one of the rocket ships,\" he says.

They mostly comprise the big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, and big pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>These increasingly globalised firms have been enjoying sustained and extraordinary returns.</p><p>In the 1960s, the top 10 per cent of firms by return on invested capital enjoyed returns of around 10 per cent a year. Today, the top 10 per cent of firms are enjoying annual returns of 100 per cent.</p><p>And those blockbuster returns are not fleeting. Of firms in the top 10 per cent by performance in 2003, 85 per cent were still in the top 10 per cent in 2013.</p><p>\"The rocket ships are not just going up and crashing, they are going up and continuing to go up,\" Orszag told the conference. That good fortune spills over into higher wages for all tech and pharma employees.</p><p>\"Anyone at that firm is doing great, if you're not at that firm, not so much.\"</p><p>Sure, CEOs are still richer than their employees.</p><p>But mid-level employees at Facebook have been getting richer quicker than comparable employees at US manufacturing firms.</p><p>Inequality has been rising between firms, not within them.</p><p>\"It may be that we have dramatically mischaracterised a lot of what's driving increasing inequality in the US,\" Orszag told this week's conference.</p><p>If we have, the usually policy remedies, like boosting top tax rates and spending more on education, won't solve the problem.</p><p>If we want to stop the rise in inequality - which recent studies have suggested has become harmful to economic growth - we need to focus on what is driving the super profits of some firms.</p><p>Usually, you'd expect competition to erode such super normal returns.</p><p>But this hasn't happened for the tech and pharma giants.</p><p>Perhaps they're just wonderful companies, run by excellent managers who make better decisions than their competitors.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>A more likely explanation is that these companies benefit in some way from a lack of competition.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies obviously benefit from the awarding of patent rights, which given them the incentive to develop new technologies. Perhaps that incentive is larger than it needs to be.</p><p>But how to explain the monopolistic hue of large tech companies?</p><p>One would think the world of technology is fast moving, with little barriers to entry.</p><p>But many of the big tech companies operate in markets which exhibit a unique \"winner takes all\" character, giving rise to natural monopolies.</p><p>Facebook benefits from being the biggest entrenched social network. Similarly, Google benefits from being the biggest and most recognisable search engine.</p><p>In this sense, they are natural monopolies, much like the copper wires that Telstra owns that go to your house or the poles and wires of electricity companies.</p><p>Monopolists are able to extract \"rents\": returns above what would be needed to keep them in business. That's bad, because it usually means consumers pay higher prices than others.</p><p>Monopolists then divert some of their profits into lobbying government to set the rules of the game even further in their favour, a process known as \"rent seeking\". Hello Gina.</p><p>Historically, governments regulate natural monopolies by setting their prices or dictating access by third parties.</p><p>Orszag says it's an open question whether such remedies need to be applied to tech monopolies.</p><p>Perhaps they're just great businesses, or maybe, as Orszag says, they're \"monopolies that are using our personal information without paying us and extracting a monopoly rent by selling ads based on that personal information.\"</p><p>If we want to tackle inequality, Orszag prescribes a greater focus on anti-trust and competition policy.</p><p>Interestingly, he also flags housing policy as an important tool to tackle inequality.</p><p>Basically, people need to be able to afford to live near the rocket ship companies to get on board.</p><p>\"If the price of a house is extraordinarily expensive in the rocket ship areas, because wages have been bid up there, it is very difficult for you to move into that local labour market and up your chances of being able to hop on to one of the rocket ships,\" he says. Government regulations often impede the supply of new land, keeping property prices high.</p><p>This has a doubling down effect of rewarding starship employees not only with supersized pay packets, but excessive returns on their housing investments relative to other workers.</p><p>Does Orszag's thesis apply to Australia?</p><p>It's hard to tell. Australia has long been an oligopolist's paradise.

They mostly comprise the big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, and big pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>These increasingly globalised firms have been enjoying sustained and extraordinary returns.</p><p>In the 1960s, the top 10 per cent of firms by return on invested capital enjoyed returns of around 10 per cent a year. Today, the top 10 per cent of firms are enjoying annual returns of 100 per cent.</p><p>And those blockbuster returns are not fleeting. Of firms in the top 10 per cent by performance in 2003, 85 per cent were still in the top 10 per cent in 2013.</p><p>\"The rocket ships are not just going up and crashing, they are going up and continuing to go up,\" Orszag told the conference. That good fortune spills over into higher wages for all tech and pharma employees.</p><p>\"Anyone at that firm is doing great, if you're not at that firm, not so much.\"</p><p>Sure, CEOs are still richer than their employees.</p><p>But mid-level employees at Facebook have been getting richer quicker than comparable employees at US manufacturing firms.</p><p>Inequality has been rising between firms, not within them.</p><p>\"It may be that we have dramatically mischaracterised a lot of what's driving increasing inequality in the US,\" Orszag told this week's conference.</p><p>If we have, the usually policy remedies, like boosting top tax rates and spending more on education, won't solve the problem.</p><p>If we want to stop the rise in inequality - which recent studies have suggested has become harmful to economic growth - we need to focus on what is driving the super profits of some firms.</p><p>Usually, you'd expect competition to erode such super normal returns.</p><p>But this hasn't happened for the tech and pharma giants.</p><p>Perhaps they're just wonderful companies, run by excellent managers who make better decisions than their competitors.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>A more likely explanation is that these companies benefit in some way from a lack of competition.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies obviously benefit from the awarding of patent rights, which given them the incentive to develop new technologies. Perhaps that incentive is larger than it needs to be.</p><p>But how to explain the monopolistic hue of large tech companies?</p><p>One would think the world of technology is fast moving, with little barriers to entry.</p><p>But many of the big tech companies operate in markets which exhibit a unique \"winner takes all\" character, giving rise to natural monopolies.</p><p>Facebook benefits from being the biggest entrenched social network. Similarly, Google benefits from being the biggest and most recognisable search engine.</p><p>In this sense, they are natural monopolies, much like the copper wires that Telstra owns that go to your house or the poles and wires of electricity companies.</p><p>Monopolists are able to extract \"rents\": returns above what would be needed to keep them in business. That's bad, because it usually means consumers pay higher prices than others.</p><p>Monopolists then divert some of their profits into lobbying government to set the rules of the game even further in their favour, a process known as \"rent seeking\". Hello Gina.</p><p>Historically, governments regulate natural monopolies by setting their prices or dictating access by third parties.</p><p>Orszag says it's an open question whether such remedies need to be applied to tech monopolies.</p><p>Perhaps they're just great businesses, or maybe, as Orszag says, they're \"monopolies that are using our personal information without paying us and extracting a monopoly rent by selling ads based on that personal information.\"</p><p>If we want to tackle inequality, Orszag prescribes a greater focus on anti-trust and competition policy.</p><p>Interestingly, he also flags housing policy as an important tool to tackle inequality.</p><p>Basically, people need to be able to afford to live near the rocket ship companies to get on board.</p><p>\"If the price of a house is extraordinarily expensive in the rocket ship areas, because wages have been bid up there, it is very difficult for you to move into that local labour market and up your chances of being able to hop on to one of the rocket ships,\" he says. Government regulations often impede the supply of new land, keeping property prices high.</p><p>This has a doubling down effect of rewarding starship employees not only with supersized pay packets, but excessive returns on their housing investments relative to other workers.</p><p>Does Orszag's thesis apply to Australia?</p><p>It's hard to tell. Australia has long been an oligopolist's paradise. Like Noah and his Ark, our companies come two by two: two airlines, two supermarkets, two telcos.</p><p>Perhaps a higher proportion of Aussie workers are already sharing in the economic rents of their employers, keeping our wages growth higher than in the US.</p><p>The price Aussies pay is higher retail prices from a lack of competition, like the higher interest rates we will pay now the banks have a stranglehold on the mortgage market.</p><p>Certainly, the price of property near our two biggest CBDs - where most of our large oligopolists have their headquarters - has gone up like a rocket, potentially making it harder for low wage workers to access these jobs.</p><p>Competition policy and housing policy will prove key to the future of inequality in Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1001800326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J3J-FXV1-DY19-C0PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><timeReceived>08:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

'Banks have a lot of managerial talent, but I would argue that they need a lot more tech talent. That is what they are short of. But tech talent is not attracted to banks. </p><p>Such people are attracted to big tech companies,' Sengupta said in an interview after a forum on digital innovation hosted by The Korea Times.'So that is why you have to change the culture, the work environment.

And it is hard to make a transformation without a cultural change.'So the real question is: Are traditional banks moving fast enough to change given the regulatory support for innovation, and a market that has consumers who are fast adopters?Sengupta said he does not think they are moving as fast as banks in other regions such as Singapore and Hong Kong.But he added banks are making 'smart' moves by joining hands with fintech companies, which, in turn, can access banks' resources and systems to boost their business. On the other hand, banks can get access to fintech partners' products and use their technological capability.'In my view, most fintech companies will find it challenging to scale up their business. Having a bank partner will enable them to do that,' he said. 'And banks will have to invest in building a technical architecture such as an open interface system, enabling the partnership to work.'He said banks will not be able to do everything in the near future amid the unbundling of financial services. Through such partnerships, fintech companies will be able to provide better services than banks can.'That is why most banks are increasingly working with fintech partners. There is definitely a win-win and more cooperation in that field. This will be one of the models for the future.'</p><p>Joydeep Sengupta, senior partner of McKinsey &amp; Company, introduces cases of business' digital transformation at a forum hosted by The Korea Times in Seoul, June 26. / Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chulHe said banks will have to 'test and try' different ways to build innovative business models.This is because there isn't one single specific model that can help them achieve digital innovation or transformation.He pointed to Lloyds Bank, ING Group and DBS, stressing, 'Their models are not the same.'However, there is a common theme that can help spur innovation.He reiterated the importance of organizational change, workplace diversity, strong partnerships and investment in technologies.'Banks will ultimately have to move toward becoming a platform business, and go beyond banking to build an ecosystem,' the senior partner said.He added Korea is well-positioned in many areas. For instance, its consumers are willing to use digital channels, with 53 percent of the people here using electronic wallets for financial transactions, the highest among Asians, according to McKinsey. 'Adapt to what your customers are doing. You do not have to build everything. Let consumers participate in your digital journey. Partner up. There are a number of ways to transform,' Sengupta said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-3NW1-JCBN-53V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002P53</classCode><className>LLOYDS BANKING GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001SF9</classCode><className>ING GROEP NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

How do you bring folks along when you\u2019re doing things that are designed to make them uncomfortable?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Polis: People didn\u2019t elect me to keep doing the same darn thing. They elected me to look for innovation and bold new solutions, and that\u2019s part of my mandate. So across every area, whether it\u2019s agriculture or higher education or K-12, we\u2019re going to push the envelope to make sure the future works for Coloradans.</p><p>CP: Would you be OK with your administration keeping economic incentive packages under wraps like those that were prepared bidding for Amazon\u2019s HQ2?</p><p>Polis: I\u2019m skeptical of corporate tax giveaways but not categorically against them in every case. I think it is likely we\u2019ll use less of them so we can return more money to taxpayers through lower taxes.</p><p>CP: How effective do you think those incentives are?</p><p>Polis: Effective in the short term, not effective in the medium or long term.</p><p>CP: How do you and Marlon approach technology as parents, considering what a key role it\u2019s played in your life?</p><p>Polis: Our kids use iPads both for education and recreation. In many ways, our kids use iPads instead of television; I don\u2019t think either of them really ever watch TV. So, as a result, they have maybe two hours of iPad time during weekends and an hour a day during the week, in addition to anything that they\u2019re doing that\u2019s academic that would be allowed above and beyond that.</p><p>CP: Do you think children are being exposed to too much tech too early?</p><p>Polis: Children have to be savvy and have to grow up to be savvy in the use of technology. Every parent has their own style. I don\u2019t think that keeping technology away from kids helps them to develop the skills they will need to navigate technology they will inevitably encounter as they get older.</p><p>CP: Does Colorado need to regulate big tech, like Facebook?</p><p>Polis: No. We need to do what we can to keep a free and open internet by protecting the neutrality of the internet. We look forward to pursuing an agenda that, in the absence of federal protection, will make sure that all content and all service have access to an open internet through net neutrality.</p><p>CP: Your position on events like the Olympics seems to be a departure from Gov. Hickenlooper, who always seemed to be looking for ways to put Colorado on the national stage. How do you plan to showcase Colorado?</p><p>Polis: Certainly it\u2019s the role of the governor to promote our state; it\u2019s one I relish. I look forward to attracting businesses to our state, both doing international trade missions as well as working to attract conferences to our state.</p><p>CP: You didn\u2019t support either Propositions 109 or 110, and neither did voters. Where are we going to get the revenue for transportation?</p><p>Polis: The voters have clearly spoken, so therefore there are two things we know we can rule out. Those two things are a sales tax and bonding with no new revenue, respectively. The voters have said no, decisively, to those. We\u2019re willing to have a conversation about anything else with Republicans and Democrats and the business community and reading the tea leaves of what the voters have said.</p><p>CP: How urgent is it to come up with a solution by the end of the upcoming legislative session?</p><p>Polis: I\u2019ve always stressed openness to using some general fund money for transportation, but what we do in a given year is never going to even the gap in the need to build out 21st century infrastructure.</p><p>CP: You\u2019ve said that you don\u2019t want to take away Coloradans\u2019 right to vote on tax increases. Do you think there are parts of TABOR that need changing?</p><p>Polis: What I ran on, and what I intend to do, is to be a convener, which means of the education community, transportation community, Republicans and Democrats, and different geographic interests across our state. We plan on beginning those discussions soon with getting everybody on board with how we can make our state more governable with better language in our state Constitution.</p><p>CP: Is campaign finance reform something Colorado should try to tackle?</p><p>Polis: I hope so. I think a lot of legislators have ideas that I am fully supportive of around increased transparency. Would be happy to have that discussion. I\u2019ve long been a supporter of campaign finance reform to reduce the influence that special interests have on politics. If there are bills that go in that direction, then (I\u2019m) likely to sign them.</p><p>CP: You\u2019ve said you want to bring oil and gas, local communities and environmentalists together to solve underlying issues that give rise to surface conflicts. What might a solution look like?</p><p>Polis: We want to formalize the role that local communities, cities and counties have in the siting process for oil and gas and address the concerns that neighbors have with regard to where drilling occurs near where people live or work or go to school.</p><p>CP: There\u2019s a sense that Democrats are considering the balance between having full control of state government and being able to do whatever the party decides, versus what\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201coverreach,\u201d like the legislative agenda that prompted the recalls in 2013. What approach do you take to that?</p><p>Polis: What I would encourage everyone to do \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 is be true to what they ran on and deliver for the people. If you ran on improving the roads, then work on that. I ran on delivering full-day kindergarten and making sure that we can achieve 100-percent renewable energy by 2040 or sooner, and so we plan on fulfilling the mandate the voters gave me working with the Legislature, as well as administratively through my appointments to get it done.</p><p>CP: Do you have a mandate to pursue universal health care?</p><p>Polis: To cover more people, absolutely, rather than less people. In the campaign this came up a number of times, where some of the policies on the other side would jeopardize people\u2019s insurance that they had today. Our mandate is to save people money on health care, pass those savings along to people who get their insurance on their own or through the employer, and expand coverage to more people.</p><p>CP: What does your family traditionally do for Thanksgiving?</p><p>Polis: We sit around the table and have a turkey with the grandparents and the cousins and have a family dinner. We\u2019re thankful for the blessing of living in Colorado and our health and our family.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSGAZT-2161762306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSGAZT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3D-6SC1-JBHT-D3DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Freedom Newspapers, Inc.

We talk to him about cybersecurity, the US, China - and Estonia.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What exactly does your EU Task Force do?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was set up to get a better handle on the cybersecurity issues that were affecting the financial sector across Europe. Having run a survey of various financial institutions across Europe to gauge the potential issues, we put the nine issues we found into a report, having had a few meetings on the subject and taking submissions from various people - financial institutions but also organisations ranging from experts within the [European] Commission to the big tech companies like Microsoft and IBM.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our report has been very well received; now we're just waiting to see what the Commission's going to do about it. These sorts of reports have in the past been quite influential, and we think this one may be too. But it's still quite early days.</p><p>In terms of cybersecurity, the decision has been taken that we're not going to have any specific cybersecurity laws - we're just going to hang everything for the moment onto the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and see how that goes. In some countries, like the UK, the GDPR has not been all that massive a change - but some other countries are totally starting from scratch. So the general feeling is that we're waiting for that all to bed down a bit, then see what the issues are like. It's a massive cultural change in many areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are you expecting the Commission to do after digesting your report?</emphasis></p><p>Make tweaks to the GDPR and breach reporting requirements. There are six or so such requirements that impinge upon financial institutions, which unfortunately are not particularly well coordinated, even on matters like how long after the breach it should be reported. We're not expecting particular regulations, but there has also been talk of a directive on free flow of information, to make things flow more smoothly.</p><p>There are other bits of assistance we hope to get out of the Commission. The Commission produces quite a bit of guidance material and provides political support as well - support on enforcement, if you like. It'd also be looking at the experiences of the GDPR in the various different member states, and spotting issues that pop up in some countries but not others. All this collection, collation and analysis will take some time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What progress has already been made in financial sector cybersecurity, and what are the main challenges ahead?</emphasis></p><p>There's been a big increase in cyber awareness. The UK government has been spending quite a bit of time on the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI), which includes the key elements of the financial sector: the Central Bank, the G-SIBs [global systemically important banks], the clearing houses and exchanges, and so on.</p><p>But there are still cyber attacks going on all the time. Senior people at Barclays will tell you they're getting thousands of attempted attacks every day. They seem to be doing pretty well so far, actually, in terms of fighting those off. But I'm not entirely convinced that we're picking up sufficient data about those attacks and what the response is to individual customers. I don't think people are really collating those. Liability is not purely on the banks, which are trying to fight it off and [find the blame].</p><p>There are also quite a few substantial financial institutions that don't appear to have done very much, which is a bit of a concern. But I'm not naming names.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What kind of companies have been most and least responsive to cybercrime threats?</emphasis></p><p>At the SME [small to medium-sized enterprises] end, I was quite surprised by FSB [Financial Stability Board] research into what SMEs had done after cyberattacks they'd suffered. Most had done very little between the attack and getting back up and running. Some businesses have taken some very public steps: TalkTalk had a significant issue that dramatically affected its share price, but took a number of steps to try to make sure customers were happy, and win them back. I saw a presentation they gave that suggested they were stronger after the attack than before, because of various messages they'd put in place and the PR activity they'd done. So if you've had the wake-up call and done something about it, it could be good news.</p><p>Having said that, I think research by Gartner suggests that [the vast majority]\u00a0of businesses that have had a significant cyberattack are expected to fold within two years. They find it almost impossible to recover, and that is a concern.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are your best practices for anti-cybercrime protection and compliance?</emphasis></p><p>It's a combination of GRC: governance (looking at data governance, information flow, storage and back-ups); risk (looking at threat reports by the likes of McAfee, Verizon, Kaspersky and the big consultancies, as well as at your own vulnerabilities); and capability (cyber awareness training).</p><p>For the latter, the training needs to get [employees] to be able to do something, not just sit there and nod - knowing how to respond to a phishing attack, for instance. That's more of a challenge: cultural change takes nine months to [take effect], and you have to do things in a certain sort of way.</p><p>One CEO decided that the best way he could cut down on his information risk was to introduce a clear desk policy. One Sunday evening he went into the office and checked on the clear desks, and found that all the junior staff were clear-desking because they saw it as a company policy with which they had to comply. With the senior management, he found there was still paperwork everywhere. The CEO gave chocolates to those that complied and none to those that didn't. Little things like that can induce cultural improvements.</p><p>There are harder ways of doing this, of course, such as blocking the ability to use USB sticks on office equipment. You have to be slightly careful about that, though: if the office system is so difficult to access, as we saw with Hillary Clinton, you just end up emailing things to yourself at home and do work on a less secure system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lithuania and Estonia frequently rank highly in global cybersecurity indexes. Why, and what are they doing that others should emulate?</emphasis></p><p>Estonia - or E-stonia! - made a major strategic play for the country. There aren't many Estonians, but they sat down and said, \"What can we do as a tiny country on the edge of Europe, with our EU membership?\" And they spotted that the world was going digital, so decided to train their people, and give special dispensations to encourage those good at IT to go to Estonia or link up with Estonians.</p><p>Then they wanted to get people to be able to come to Estonia electronically, if not physically. So they developed this concept of electronic residency. You can become an e-resident in Estonia and use the benefits of an EU passport if you've set up an Estonian company and do things from there. That works for quite a few sectors, but not for regulated financial instruments. The 1995 Post-BCCI Directive, when it was decided that a bank's head office and registered office had to be in the same jurisdiction under the same regulator, makes it hard for companies wanting to get around Brexit difficulties by setting up an operation in Estonia. But if your business isn't covered by the Post-BCCI Directive, there's no problem in doing that.</p><p>Estonia is obviously very close to Russia, and Russia has been exercising quite close to the border, flexing a bit of muscle. There's a bit of concern in the Baltic states about that. They've been subject to lots of cyberattacks too, so their cyber defences are going to be pretty strong.</p><p>Their EU residency scheme isn't hugely [utilised], but they've got some significant figures - Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, is electronically resident in Estonia. Lots of people from lots of countries have decided to base their electronic business out of Estonia. That's good in terms of the digital side.</p><p>Estonia had the presidency of the EU as well, and each state when it gets the presidency is allowed to work out what its priorities should be. Top of the Estonians' list was the development of the digital single market. And they've got some very bright people.</p><p>This all sort of explains why Estonia is in certain respects ahead of countries like the UK, where to do certain things would need parliamentary approval, ministerial sign-off and endless discussion with various parties. In Estonia, there are fewer people, a single strategy, and everyone singing from the same hymn sheet.</p><p>The Lithuanians are slightly different. Some of their governmental figures have told me they're trying to provide back-office facilities for companies operating around Europe. This would mean outsourcing your corporate secretarial work into Lithuania, where it would be a lot cheaper. They're set up to make that as efficient and effective as possible. One of my clients is in the process of getting Central Bank of Lithuania authorisation to perform various payment institution services. Latvia is a bit behind the curve, I think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some senior figures seem very trusting of the US-UK information-sharing agreement and the fact that the US wouldn't spy\u00a0on the UK. What are your thoughts on US proclivities in this direction?</emphasis></p><p>My first thought would be that they don't need to spy: they've already got the information. It sort of depends on what you're looking at. Most UK and US businesses are probably on a Microsoft platform, and if you're on Windows, the amount of data that is automatically transmitted to Microsoft is just phenomenal. There are ways of turning that down a bit, but you have to be quite switched on about how you configure that operating system.</p><p>We have to have a certain amount of trust in this area. Edward Snowdon's new book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Permanent Record</emphasis> explains in detail what gets transmitted, stored and used. In certain respects, this is extremely important - particularly when you're looking at terrorist organisations. Some of them have fantastic capabilities: ISIS managed to hack into US Central Command's [Twitter account] and deface it, for example. They're quite adept, and quite capable of developing their own apps for their own communication, and set up their own encryption.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Huawei gets the headlines when it comes to Chinese involvement in our infrastructure. What are some of the less high-profile developments in China vis-\u00e0-vis Western cyber vulnerabilities?</emphasis></p><p>Going back a few years, there was a report saying that China had set up six intelligence schools, one of which was entirely devoted to hacking. Loads of other countries will be doing the same thing. The Americans, the Iranians, the Israelis, who have a fantastic IT capability. Israel has made a strategic decision to focus on the IT sector.</p><p>A lot of the Huawei/China stuff, I can't help feeling, is quite political and ramped up. It's all to help stoke the US-China trade war. But when you look at the development of China and its internet, it's phenomenal. Look at the amount of people in China, and how it's expanding, and how the US isn't expanding at the same rate - it's pretty obvious China is going to overtake the US at some stage in economic terms. China's buying up a huge amount of stuff in the US and other countries. It's all over Africa; they've got a million people in Cabinda [in Angola] alone. It's like a Chinese city where Angolans don't get to go. The Chinese don't integrate at all; they even fly their own food in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've talked about how the GDPR unfairly penalizes small companies. But in the GDPR's first year, most of the $56 million total of fines was for Google, by the French regulator. Can you give examples of small business that were unfairly fined following cybercrime?</emphasis></p><p>[The Google decision] shows that the data protection regulators around Europe are flexing a bit of muscle. But I think it varies a bit, depending on what the policy is nationally. The enforcement attitude is that there's a lot of cultural change involved, which will take a fair bit of time, so when there are issues faced by companies, the authority wants to hear about them in advance. The authority's usual approach is to then offer suggestions to the companies, which is a very mature approach to regulation, rather than just turning around and slapping people with a big fine straight away.</p><p>Fining, in terms of compliance behaviour, does not work. It's never worked in the financial sector, and why people think it would work in data protection I've no idea. Culprits weigh the benefits of breaking the law against the cost of the fine, and just swallow hard, write the cheque, and avoid sorting out their institutions. There was a big song and dance around the Siemens corruption case in 2008, but when you look at the figures, Siemens has been taken back up by the regulators all the time. In the financial sector, see the number of times Deutsche Bank gets mentioned under some sort of regulatory action. It's received loads of fines. What it needs to change is the culture of the institution. That's difficult to change.</p><p>A good example in compliance terms is Marks &amp; Spencer's approach to shoplifting. A while ago, M&amp;S realised that an hour of a lawyer's time to discuss a case would cost more than any given stolen item, let alone the cost of pursuing justice through the courts. So it tackled the problem through perception. It put up notices in the areas where the high-value products were sold, and warnings at the till saying \"Warning: we always prosecute shoplifters\". Of course, they didn't - but they wanted to affect prospective shoplifters' psychology. To back that up, they did take certain shoplifters to court, but only in egregious cases, and gave those cases lots of media coverage. They found that through massaging perceptions, they got the shoplifting figures right down. Our data protection regulators need to be equally clever. But it's a long haul.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How, specifically, would you encourage businesses to improve their cybersecurity?</emphasis></p><p>I'm on the advisory committee to IASME (Information Assurance to SMEs), which has been introducing a system whereby SMEs get in touch with IASME and ask it to have a look at their cybersecurity systems. We run through a questionnaire with them, and then give them a certification. They pay us a nominal sum - \u00a3300 for our lowest level of certification. Though if you look at the UK corporate database of six million companies, at the current rate of certification, it would take well over a century to certify everybody. And by then, everything will have changed anyway!</p><p>If you're going for cyber insurance and you've completed the UK government's Cyber Essentials scheme, you should get a discount off your cyber insurance. But then we're looking at a different cost-benefit situation: would you need the cyber insurance if you've done the scheme?</p><p>Another way of getting people to put in place cybersecurity measures is for the government to say, \"If you want to win a government contract, you'll have to do the Cyber Essentials scheme, or Cyber Essentials Plus.\" And if you're a part of the CNI, further measures will be required, but you'd get a lot of help. No one wants the electricity grid going down. That could be a disaster.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LLOENG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPC-HJJ1-DYRH-C001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442999</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Leaders League All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Leaders League Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28199\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He gave the Tax Commissioner greater powers to pursue them. And who could forget the sometimes fiery exchanges at the Senate inquiry into tax avoidance where the tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft were slammed for their complex taxation arrangements?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well today it was the turn of big pharma. Nine of the world's most powerful drug manufacturers faced the same senators at a public hearing in Sydney. Some of those companies are household names - Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, but others that are lesser-known. The committee heard that together they earned $8.2 billion in total revenue, but only paid $85 million in tax in Australia. All were asked whether their corporate structures were designed to reduce their tax liability in this country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well here are some highlights, prepared by Jason Om.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI, COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The question is whether your tax arrangements have been structured in such a way to minimise your tax obligations in this country.</p><p>JAMES SHARKEY, ASTRAZENECA: We engage in all of our activities in compliance with domestic and relevant international laws and regulations. This includes in relation to taxation, in respect of which we abide by both the letter and the spirit of the law. We prepare our accounts with the assistance of external professional service providers, we lodge our tax returns on time, we pay our tax on time and we pay our tax in full.</p><p>SEAN EDWARDS, DEPUTY CHAIR: This is not going too well for you. And if you are the most senior manager in this business, this is starting to look like something which has been fabricated to minimise your tax in this country.</p><p>DAVID GALLAGHER, PFIZER, CHAIRMAN: I don't agree with that, Senator, if I may. I think we said at the outset that we manage our business appropriately, we manage it within all the appropriate regulations and rules and laws of this land and that is what we are meant to do, and if we do otherwise, we'd be in a different position.</p><p>SEAN EDWARDS: So I'm wrong? Everything I've asserted is wrong? You pay three and a half times more for your cost of goods into this country than you do in another country, but you observe all the tax rules, which I freely accept. I know that you're operating legally. I don't know how many more times I can say that. But that's not gonna pass the pub test for whether it's actually a fair and reasonable deal for Australians. It just doesn't work for me, but you can test my ...</p><p>DAVID GALLAGHER: No, what I was contesting, Senator, just to be clear, was i think you mentioned the word fabricate and I was contesting that, Senator. So I think that's appropriate for me to do so 'cause we do not fabricate.</p><p>LOUISE WEINGROD, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: We won't let our Australian distributor lose money.</p><p>COMMITTEE MEMBER: Exactly. But that's the point, isn't it? You basically (inaudible).</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: You make sure they just have enough.</p><p>LOUISE WEINGROD: No, we make sure we have (inaudible).</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: It looks like the structure is being set internationally with a predetermined level of profitability with the objective of minimising the Australian profitability because we're a high tax jurisdiction.</p><p>LOUISE WEINGROD: Not at all, Sir.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: If it's not based on the cost of production, what is this agreement based on?</p><p>LAURENCE MCALLISTER, MD, SANOFI: It's obvious there's nothing inappropriate being done here. We are working within the established principles of the OECD and the Australian taxpayer.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Mr McAllister, that wasn't the question. You know what the question is, you're just not answering it.</p><p>NICK XENOPHON, COMMITTEE MEMBER: No, no, I'm just saying, so, you've got rid of the arrangement in Luxembourg?</p><p>MELISSA GEIGER, GLAXOSMITHKLINE AUSTRALIA: Yes.</p><p>NICK XENOPHON: Do you have arrangements in other countries which have lower tax rates? Cayman Islands, Bahamas, other exotic locations?</p><p>MELISSA GEIGER: No, no, no. No, we have a policy that we've published on our website. We've published updated that since 2012, recently updated it in 2014 and I attached it to the submission and we do not use tax havens.</p><p>TONY JONES: Well Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, you just saw him there as the chairman of the Senate Economics References Committee which has been holding that public hearing in Sydney today, he joins me now.</p><p>Thanks for being here.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Fantastic to be here.</p><p>TONY JONES: You set out the figures at the beginning. These nine big pharma companies raised $8.5 billion in revenue in Australia, but paid only $86 million in tax. I think that's one per cent, effectively. How much should they have paid?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well a lot more than that. I mean, look, what's so extraordinary - I just want to kind of explain what has really gone on here. These are companies that have designed their tax arrangements to make themselves appear artificially less profitable in Australia and more profitable in low tax jurisdictions. What they do is they charge themselves for their own products from their own parent companies in such a way to make their tax liability here as low as possible. If you were to believe the evidence that's given, if you were to believe that the only profitability in the tax amount that they pay, you would be under the delusion that the pharmaceutical business in Australia is one of least profitable businesses going around.</p><p>TONY JONES: Sure and we know it's pretty profitable ...</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: It's very profitable.</p><p>TONY JONES: ... because they raised $8.5 billion.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: And they get $3.5 billion of that just ...</p><p>TONY JONES: How much tax should they have paid? I mean, does the committee even have an estimate? Is it billions that they have to pay back?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well, look, from what the Tax Commissioner himself said, right, if they were working through the framework of what would be appropriate international - at least two to three times that. That's the starting point. Now frankly, that's if what these companies were was only distribution hubs. The reality is they're a lot more than that.</p><p>TONY JONES: Alright.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Australian taxpayers have been ripped off here and they're continuing to be ripped off.</p><p>TONY JONES: So, how much extra revenue, do we have any idea, if they paid the same rate as Australian companies should they have paid?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: What's so extraordinary here ...</p><p>TONY JONES: In the billions, wouldn't it?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well, I think billions is probably - is higher than where it is. It's certainly a lot more than what is being paid. And the concern here is that this is - we don't even have proper figures and the Tax Office itself doesn't even have proper figures on just what the amount is. But it's not just the tax amount. I mean, what we had today was the CEOs of the nine largest pharmaceutical companies unable to tell us whether Australian consumers are being ripped off in the prices we pay for the drugs because they themselves claimed they didn't know what these drugs actually cost themselves. It's extraordinary evidence.</p><p>TONY JONES: OK. Were their tax avoidance schemes, 'cause that's what they are effectively, they're profit shifting - were their models, their mechanisms for doing that different to the big tech companies that you had in the spotlight a short time ago?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Look, first thing, when we talk about tax avoidance, tax minimisation have very, very different meanings. Tax minimisation isn't illegal. Similar and - here's the reality: the pharmaceutical companies have been doing this for a long time. The pharmaceutical companies were really the first companies to really do this at an international level. And the reason they're able to do it is all the value in pharmaceuticals is really placed in the IP and where you hold the IP - 'cause drugs themselves cost 20, 30 cents to make. The drugs themselves are quite cheap. What the real value comes in is where you decide you're going to hold that IP. They hold the IP in low tax jurisdictions and they charge themselves an exorbitant amount in Australia and it's engineered in such away that, effectively, the Australian businesses run at kind of cost and don't make a profit and they don't have to pay tax as a result.</p><p>TONY JONES: Of course all of this is legal.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: And that's what's so worrying!</p><p>TONY JONES: We should make that point. They made the point over and over again: ...</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Yes!</p><p>TONY JONES: \"We're doing nothing illegal here.\" But will they now be caught by the measures that Joe Hockey put in place in the last budget under which companies which fail to pay the appropriate level of Australian tax will actually have to pay double plus interest?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: No, and that's what's so concerning.</p><p>TONY JONES: Why not?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well because what Joe Hockey's measures effectively do, and they're not bad measures; they just don't go anywhere near far enough. There's a $7 billion Labor plan over the next 10 years that actually goes a lot further. What Joe Hockey's measures do is they make sure and try and take a step towards those who are already breaking the law, giving the Tax Office more powers to crack down on them. Now the concern here with what's gone on with transfer pricing isn't that it's illegal activity they've gotten away with, is that they're allowed to structure their companies in this way. Frankly, that's what has to change.</p><p>TONY JONES: So, well, how would you change the laws to stop that happening? 'Cause this is - say you're right: the IP's held in another country, a low tax jurisdiction. How can you force them to do otherwise?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: OK. It all comes down to what they charge themselves for their own product. And what you really have here is two companies that are not independent from one another. You have Pharmaceutical A in Australia buying a product from Pharmaceutical B in another country. And the question you have to robustly test is: how independent is that pricing arrangement and is that pricing arrangement itself created for the sole intention of minimising their tax liability? That's the real concern.</p><p>TONY JONES: OK. But we had - ATO officers have been put into 30 multinational companies to investigate how they do this tax minimalisation. Have they gone into the pharma companies, these big pharma companies, do you know?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well, look, what we found out today was the nine big pharma companies are not being audited. There is a review program in place over the next couple of years. Frankly, again, Joe Hockey's rhetoric isn't the problem; his actions have been the problem.</p><p>TONY JONES: So you want these nine companies audited, is that what you're saying?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: I think that would be an important start is making sure we're robustly testing a lot of these assertions.</p><p>TONY JONES: Did you ask the ATO why they're not doing that?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Well, because we have to go further. What we have to do is actually look at changing some of the laws in this space. And again, there is a plan there. We're talking about $7 billion over the next 10 years, that there is a plan in place to actually get that. If Joe Hockey wants to walk into the Parliament in five weeks' time and put forward a bill that Labor will support and we've said we will support it, he can actually claw back a lot of this money.</p><p>TONY JONES: OK, final question. The UK has a new law against shifting profits and 25 per cent tax on doing that effectively. Why not just do that? Why not do something that another country is already doing?</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: You're talking about - I mean, it's called the Google tax.</p><p>TONY JONES: Diverted profits tax.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Yeah, diverted profits tax. It's referred to as the Google tax. I think the concern is that at the international level, that in itself isn't going to achieve what we have to do. We need to have a comprehensive approach and we need more than just rhetoric or a one-off law. There has to be a proper program in place.</p><p>TONY JONES: OK, Sam Dastyari, more on that as that evolves, I dare say. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>SAM DASTYARI: Thank you so much for having me.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-6588370</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GBH-MM31-JCM0-63NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 1, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

The digital bank has forged a reputation for bringing quality products to market across business banking, travel money or overdraft facilities that have won it several bank of the year awards.<br/><br/>All of this has made Boden arguably the most famous woman in British fintech.<br/><br/>However, the Starling competes against UK rivals who have more customers such as Revolut which claims 10 million accounts and Monzo, which notched up four million accounts earlier this month.<br/><br/>Starling makes its cash from a mixture of charging fees on the cards it issues, its marketplace where it charges other financial service firms to sell products on its platform, as well as using its deposits to lend.<br/><br/>\"The thing to remember is that our cost base is so small the cash we raise here is meaningful,\" adds Boden.<br/><br/>The elephant in the room for all neo-banks is Big Tech firms such as Amazon or PayPal. These firms have deep pockets, large customer bases, and unlike high street banks, are platform companies themselves and so are comfortable with the business model.<br/><br/>The number of fintech deals by global tech giants - including Alibaba Group, Alphabet, Apple, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft and Tencent - increased for the fifth straight year, with $ 3.5bn invested across 46 deals in 2019, according to last month's KPMG Pulse of Fintech bi-annual report.<br/><br/>\"I think Big Tech will want to distribute banking services, says Boden. \"I don't think they will want to get involved in the financial plumbing of moving money around. Or obtaining a license, that will mean more regulation, and they already face calls for more regulation as it is.\"<br/><br/>Read the full interview here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://learnbonds.com/news/interview-starling-boss-anne-boden-says-digital-banks-%e2%80%98have-to-show-they-can-make-a-profit%e2%80%99/\">https://learnbonds.com/news/interview-starling-boss-anne-boden-says-digital-banks-%e2%80%98have-to-show-they-can-make-a-profit%e2%80%99/</url><br/><br/>Roger Baird<br/><br/>News editor<br/><br/>LearnBonds.com<br/><br/>St Magnus House<br/><br/>3 Lower Thames Street<br/><br/>London EC 6HE<br/><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pr@learnbonds.com\">pr@learnbonds.com</email><br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.com\">www.m2.com</url>))   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFF-82G1-JD3Y-Y4BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investrend Communications, Inc.

He writes daily newsletter entries on market action, stocks and trends in the economy, and I highly recommend taking a moment to peruse his site,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.madhedgefundtrader.com/\">Diary of a Mad Hedge Fund Trader.</url> - Ilene<br/> Interview With A Mad Hedge Fund Trader Introduction <br/>Mad Hedge Fund Trader began his career in finance by moving to Japan and working at Dai Nana Securities as a research analyst in 1974. In 1976 he was named the Tokyo correspondent for The Economist magazine and the Financial Times, which then shared an office. He traveled the world interviewing famous people, such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. In 1982, he was named the US editor of Euromoney magazine, and in 1983 he built a new division in international equities for Morgan Stanley. (NYSE:MS)  After moving to London in 1985, Mad Hedge supervised sales and trading in Japanese equity derivatives. In 1989, he became a director of the Swiss Bank Corp, responsible for Japanese equity derivatives. A year later, he set up an international hedge fund which he sold in 1999.</p><p><br/><br/>I havent even covered all of Mad Hedges adventures, such as his latent movie star career (as an extra in the 1979 epic war film, Apocalypse Now), and who knows what else. But now, missing the adrenaline-surging excitement of active trading, Mad Hedge has returned to the hedge fund business, set up an educational website, and is busy keeping up with the demands of newsletter writing.. So lets begin our interview with Mad Hedge by exploring his current thoughts on the markets. <br/><br/>Interview<br/><br/>Ilene: Hi Mad Hedge. Youve had a fascinating career having little to do with your major in biochemistry. A brief review of your newsletter shows that your recommendations early in 2009 have appreciated by an average of around 400%. Youve been writing your daily market thoughts and investment strategies at your website - <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.madhedgefundtrader.com/\">www.madhedgefundtrader.com</url> - which its terrific, by the way. What are your goals with this site?<br/><br/> Mad Hedge: This whole thing started out as a letter to investors in my hedge fund, to tell them my thinking behind my positions. Then I thought, why not post this on the web and see what happens? Six months later it is now going out to 50,000 readers a day, mostly to portfolio managers, financial advisors, and traders. The growth has been explosive.<br/><br/>Ilene: Who are your readers? <br/><br/>I seemed to have stumbled on a market that I describe as \u0153semi-professionals. If you are a big hedge fund, with a staff of 600 and a huge in-house research department, Im not going to tell you anything you dont already know. But there appear to be a few million people out there who trade their own accounts, or invest their own IRAs. They have never worked on Wall Street, but have taught themselves a lot about markets and investing. My letter gives them the 30,000 foot view on global stock, bond, currency, commodity, and real estate markets which they cant find at their online broker. About half of them are from abroad. When I get up in the morning now, there are five e-mails waiting for me from China and India asking what to do about natural gas. I also try to make the letter funny and entertaining. Not all financial publications have to be dreary reading. Its not always about the next stock to buy.<br/><br/>Ilene: In a recent letter you wrote that one of your favorite ETFs is the Proshares Ultra Short Treasury Trust (TBT). Why is that?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: TBT is a 200% leveraged bet that long Treasury bonds will go down. While the Fed keeps short rates low, it doesnt directly control long rates. As the supply of government bonds increases exponentially, their eventual collapse is inevitable. All Ponzi schemes must come to an end, and the US government is no exception. We currently have the greatest liquidity driven market of all time, and the ten year is eking out a mere 3.30% yield, pricing in near zero inflationary expectations. The average yield on this paper for the last ten years is 6.20%. If the yield goes back to 5%, that will take the TBT from $45 to $70. The TBT could perform even better if Treasuries lose their triple \u0153A rating, which I think is a real possibility.<br/><br/>Historically, bonds are not a good buy in a low interest rate, deflationary environment. If long rates move from 3% back to the 12% we saw in the early eighties, bond holders will get slaughtered, and the TBT could exceed $200. Even if inflation stays low, the sheer weight of supply and credit concerns will crater government bond prices.<br/><br/>Ilene: Whats the worst case scenario for the bond market?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Debt service is currently 11% of the budget. If interest rates rise sharply, that could double to 22%. Then you get a downward spiral like you saw in Latin America in the eighties, when higher debt service creates more borrowing, and more borrowing creates a higher debt service, until the whole thing blows up. At some point China, Japan, the Middle Eastern countries may stop buying our debt. There are only so many \u0153greater fools out there.<br/><br/>The only way out of this is for the economy to return to a long term 3%-4% growth rate. Thats obviously what Obama is hoping for with his programs. Hes taking big risks, but he doesnt have much choice. He really did inherit a bad hand.  If he did nothing, wed be in a depression by now, with 25% unemployment. He understands what hes doing and understands the risks. He has great economic advisors.<br/><br/>Obama couldnt have allowed the banking system to collapse. We need banks as the economys lynchpin. A year ago we could have lost the entire financial system over a weekend. Ships were being turned around at sea and going back home because their letters of credit were failing. The freeze up in credit could have gone on for years.  <br/><br/>The stock market is up 50% since Obama took office, so it likes the uneasy stability that we have now. Credit markets have recovered tremendously, and IPOs are coming to the market again. Junk bond funds are up, confidence is returning. Theres greater willingness to lend, though only at high interest rates. But its a big improvement over last year.<br/><br/>Ilene: What do you expect for mortgage rates in the next few months? Years?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: You shouldnt touch real estate, as I think it will be dead money for another decade. Rent, dont buy. If you have to buy, then get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage now at 5%, because rates are going up a lot in the future. When I bought my first home in New York in the early eighties, I got nailed with a 17% interest rate on my mortgage. We may revisit those levels.<br/><br/>Houses will continue to move lower, maybe another 10% or so. We have another wave of foreclosures hitting the system soon, triggered by the option arm readjustments. I see support for prices when the cost of owning and the cost of renting are more in line. Home ownership may have to become cheaper than renting, because of perceived risk to the principle, for the real estate market sell-off to finish.  However, expecting houses to drop a lot from here is like shorting Citibank at $3. Weve basically had the big move already. Due to poor demographic factors, the demand for houses is going to take a long time to come back. While 80 million baby boomers are trying to sell their houses to 65 million gen Xers, dont expect a recovery in prices, especially when the gen Xers are still living in your basement.<br/><br/>Ilene: You mentioned you missed the rally in financials, but still have concerns about the financial sector. <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: With financials, I knew they would rebound, but didnt imagine the extensive move weve seen. It was the greatest dead cat bounce and short covering rally of all time. But the financial sector will have troubles for years. If I had to buy U.S. stocks, Id buy big tech stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) , (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO), because for the most part they have tons of cash and little debt. Tech stocks didnt have the problems that were plaguing the other sectors. For example, they have no troubled assets, and no regulatory clamp down on their business. The credit crisis didnt affect them directly because they finance their operations through cash flow and tend not to borrow. Of course, theyre hurt indirectly when the customers have credit problems.<br/><br/>Credit markets are now seeing a huge differentiation in terms. Lenders are much more discriminating about who they lend to. American consumers are very constrained, but foreign consumers are not as constrained. They are not returning to frugality as we are because they didnt share our excesses in the first place. You dont see many black Cadillac Escalades with chrome wheels in China. If I had to buy stocks, I would buy equity in foreign companies where the growth will be in the coming years. In March, you could have bought anything and had a great trade, as the rising tide lifted all boats. But stocks in emerging markets outperformed US stocks by over a two to one margin.<br/><br/>Ilene: Would you be buying stocks now?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: No, I sold most of my positions in June. The risk was low in March, but not so low in June, and its even greater now. The PE multiple on the S&amp;P 500 has just jumped from 10 to 20 in six months. Historically, a 20 multiple is a terrible time to enter the market. Markets are discounting a \u0153V-shaped recovery, which we are not going to get. I think well get more of a \u0153square root shaped recovery, a \u0153V followed by sideways to a gradually upward sloping grind. Weve already had the \u0153V. Markets are overpriced. I dont see how we can have huge economic growth with capital-constrained banks, catatonic consumers, and commercial real estate troubles up the wazoo. One of the only positives is the weak dollar, which makes everything we sell to the rest of the world cheaper. This is good for our multi-national companies, good for our exporters. So far, the dollar is on a grinding, controlled move down, which is good. But if the dollars fall accelerates, it would not be good. A real dollar panic would lead to the widespread dumping of dollar assets, and commodity prices would explode. Then well get to $2,000 for gold and $40 for silver very quickly.<br/><br/>Ilene: You spent several years wildcatting for natural gas in Texas and Colorado, which has given you a unique insight into the energy space. What are your current thoughts on natural gas and oil?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Stay away from natural gas. The volatility will kill you. If you are a masochist, then buy it only when its cheap, on big dips, in the $3/MBTU range. In the last three years, thanks to the new \u0153fracting technology used in oil shales, we have discovered a 100 year supply of natural gas sitting under the US, and the producers have not been able to cut back fast enough. So now we have a supply glut, and we are almost out of storage. This is what took us down from $13 to $2.40 in 18 months. The lack of hurricanes has not helped demand either. Producers have been cutting back like crazy, trying to balance supply and demand, with a breakeven point of $2.   They need a cold winter to help bring things back into balance. If the industry gets organized, then gas can become the 20 year bridge we need, until energy alternatives (OOTC:EGAL)  kick in. That makes me a big supporter of the \u0153Pickens Plan.<br/><br/>Oil is much more interesting. It overshot to downside in January to $32. Crude is now at $70 climbing out of the recession. Imagine how high it will get when all economies are functioning again. The financial crisis hurt the ability of big oil companies to get financing for large development projects in oil. These projects can take five to ten years to bring online. That means we will get higher oil prices sooner. We may get a pull back to the $50s, but the $30s would be a stretch. The $32 low was an artificial one caused by a complete absence of liquidity in all markets. I dont think well see those lows again.<br/><br/>Ilene: Where do you see the price of oil going in the distant future?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I think it may dip into the 50s, then up, perhaps skyrocketing to $300 before dropping back down to $3 after alternatives take over and demand vanishes. But thats at best 20 years out. If we can wean ourselves off oil in 20 years, it would be a huge accomplishment.<br/><br/>Ilene: I noticed you speak a little about politics in your essays; do you have a leaning one way or another?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Im politically neutral. Im getting bashed by the right these days because Ive said that the Republicans have no ability to affect the legislative process now. But we need to adjust our portfolios to reflect the current political realities. No matter how much you love Obama, you cant dispute the fact that the massive issuance of government bonds he is proposing is terrible for the bond market and the dollar, but great for precious metals and commodities. Obama won by a big margin, so the Democrats will be around for a while. Of course, if my \u0153square root scenario doesnt pan out, and we get a serious \u0153W recession instead, all bets are off. People will only give him the benefit of the doubt for so long.<br/><br/>Ilene: Where do you think the stock markets going to go over the next few years?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I think theres a 1 in 3 chance for new lows. Thats the \u0153W scenario. But with Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Washington Mutual (OOTC:WAMUQ)  gone, we have run out of companies that can suddenly go under and trigger a new financial crisis. The big survivors are partially government owned, and of course zero interest rates help a lot. More banks are going under, but they will be smaller, regional banks with excessive exposure to commercial real estate.<br/><br/>Ilene: How does this affect your actions in the markets?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: The best and least risky trades were in the early part of the year. Now, theres a lot more risk in all markets. Im neutral right now. If stocks dropped from here, I might be a buyer, but only in energy, commodities, and technology, and of course in emerging markets like Brazil, India, China, Korea, and Vietnam. Gold, silver and commodities have all had huge runs. My inner wimp has me in cash, waiting for better opportunities. I havent been playing the short side, because its a nightmare trying to short a liquidity driven market with interest rates at zero. There is no return on low risk investments now. Capital always moves to risky assets when interest rates are zero. Just look at Japan in the 1980s. There PE multiples soared from 10 to 100 purely driven by liquidity. For the last three years of that run the fundamental analysts were left twisting slowly in the wind. Artificially low interest rates boost asset prices to artificially high prices. It always ends in tears, but can play out for a while. You want to have an asymmetric risk reward metric in your favor, as we did in March of this year. Now, we dont have that.<br/><br/>The next downward move in the markets will more likely be due to disappointing economic data, earning misses, etc., not due to a total collapse of the system. We may sell off, but I dont think it will be to new lows. Its hard to see new lows with interest rates at zero. Instead, I see the \u0153square root recovery scenario mentioned earlier. The market may start drifting lower as people start seeing this possibility. That might set up a trading range for the S&amp;P 500 which could last for years, something like 800-1,200. During the nineties, Japan peaked at \u00a539,000, then traded in a \u00a520,000-\u00a525,000 range for five years, before the final collapse to \u00a57,000. Thats one scenario for the US.<br/><br/>Ilene: Youve had an amazing career. Let me ask you about some of the people youve interviewed. What was Ronald Reagan like?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Although I never agreed with him politically, you couldnt help but like the guy. He always had a joke ready. He was a lot smarter than he let on.<br/><br/>Ilene: And Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of Britain?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Her nickname as \u0153The Iron Lady was well deserved. She could stare holes right through you. She treated journalists like a disapproving school teacher, which of course, she was.<br/><br/>Ilene: How about the terrorist leader, Yassir Arafat, of the PLO?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: His body guards almost shot me when I reached to turn over a cassette in my tape recorder. I always thought he was a terrible leader. That is why the Palestinians never got anywhere, and why the Israelis left him alone.<br/><br/>Ilene: Meeting Chinas Deng Xiaoping must have been amazing. <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I am 64 and he was only 49, so of course there were plenty of opportunities for humor. I could never envision this guy going on the Long March. He had a tremendous wit. Someone asked him why China kept its borders closed, and wasnt this an imposition on human rights. He said if he opened the borders, the surrounding countries would get flooded with people. He asked \u0153How many Chinese do you want? 20 million? 30 million? I also met Zhou Enlai during the Cultural Revolution. He was a brilliant man, the last man on a bell shaped curve of 500 million.<br/><br/>Ilene: I read somewhere that you interviewed four US Secretaries of the Treasury. <br/><br/>Yes, Miller Reagan, Schultz, and Brady. And I visited the French chateau of a fifth, C. Douglas Dillon. I keep a collection of dollar bills they signed.<br/><br/>My goal in life was always to get in the way of history, and let it run me over. Its been an amazing life. I wouldnt trade it for anything.<br/><br/>Ilene: What about Apocalypse Now? <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I happened to be in town to interview Ferdinand Marcos, the president of the Philippines. If you look hard, Im in the USO scene. Most of the other \u0153GIs in that scene were European and Australian hippies rounded up from the Youth Hostels of Manila by Francis Ford Coppolas agents. Good luck, though. I was a lot younger and thinner then.<br/><br/>Ilene: Thanks a lot. Its been great talking to you.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>We hope you are enjoying our new interview series at Phils Stock World.

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world.  I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you live from New York.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ZAKARIA (voice-over):  On today's show, Donald Trump meets Davos.  The America First president was in snowy Switzerland this week meeting the globalists he loves to deride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Why did he go?  </p><p>TRUMP:  I believe in America.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  What did he say?  </p><p>TRUMP:  America First does not mean America alone.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  What might he have learned?  We'll discuss it all with a terrific panel.  </p><p> And an exclusive interview with Benjamin Netanyahu on President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Did that announcement dash any remaining hopes of a two-state solution or did it strengthen those hopes?  </p><p> Finally, move over Davos men, Davos woman is now running the show. The co-chairs of the World Economic Forum were all women.  </p><p> CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: Even without testosterone we can actually produce positive constructive energy.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  But is there parody of the sexes?  I'll give you facts and figures.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  But first, here is my take.  Ever since Donald Trump was elected president, I've said when he did something right, I'd say so. That's gotten me into trouble with some viewers but I'm going to do it again.  On Friday, at the World Economic Forum, Trump gave a good speech that was forthright, intelligence and conciliatory, embracing the world rather than condemning it.  If the speech represents a new approach for the president, it will be a huge step forward.  But of course, the problem with Trump is by tomorrow morning he might veer off in an entirely different direction.  </p><p> The Trump presidency so far is composed of three parts.  Trump One is the circus, the tweets, the outlandish claims, the reality TV-like show.  Trump Two is the dark populism and the demagogic assaults on minorities, the press, the judiciary and other institutions.  Trump Three is the conventional Republican president following a very standard GOP agenda, tax cuts, deregulation, the hawkish foreign policy guided by mainstream advisors, like Gary Cohn and Jim Mattis. We could be entertained by the circus, we should be appalled by the demagogue, but we have to be encouraged by Trump the Republican. That's not because I agree with the ideas he's put forth in the agenda.  I continue to think the tax cut is fiscally irresponsible, blowing a huge hole in the deficit that will starve public investment and effectively transfer government funds from the poor to the rich. On the other hand, his deregulatory push could be an important reform of an administrative state that has grown burdensome and overly complex.  </p><p>Trump's policies and his cheerleading rhetoric have, without question, boosted business confidence, which as Larry Summers has often noted is the cheapest form of economic stimulus.  </p><p> But whatever you think of the policies, the larger point is that Trump the conventional Republican is working within the American system, rather than trying to destroy it.  It's possible that the weight of the presidency and challenges of the job pushed Trump towards a more sobering responsible path.  It's also possible that Trump simply decided for now, for one day, decide with his moderate advisors.  </p><p> He often seems to be an unstable compound of Trump's one, two and three on a single day, tweeting out juvenile absurdities and lashing out, but also promoting some sensible policy.  Even at Davos, he couldn't stop himself from attacking the news media and repeatedly making false or misleading claims.  </p><p> The mood this year among the global elite at Davos was upbeat.  The world is experiencing synchronic global growth, something very rare. But underneath this good cheer, there's disquiet.  Partly because people remember their optimism just before the global recession hit. But there's also unease.  But also, while global economics looks reasonably stable, global politics is in turmoil.  The old-world order created and led by the United States is eroding and the new great powers that are entering this stage are mostly illiberal and narrow minded.  What will the world look like when China, Russia, Turkey and India, among others, have much more weight in global affairs?  </p><p> [10:05:00]  In that context, the role, capacity and intentions of the United States and its president become central.  If the American president in these times seems uncommitted to the international system, hostile to the world, indifferent to democratic values and mercurial in temper, that's especially dangerous today.  So when Trump behaves better, as he did on Friday, everyone breathes a sigh of relief.  </p><p> I don't seek to normalize Donald Trump, but I do believe that, given the stakes, America and the world are better off for these moments when he behaves more like a normal president.  </p><p> For more, go to CNN.com/Fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week.</p><p> And let's get started.  </p><p> You just heard my take.  Let's see what my powerhouse panel thinks of Donald Trump's Davos debut.  In London, Zanny Minton Beddoes joins us, the editor-in-chief of \"The Economist.\"  The magazine's new edition is all about \"The Next War, The Growing Threat of Major Conflict in Today's World.\"  Rana Foroohar is in Rome today.  She's a global business columnist for the \"FT\" and CNN's global economic analyst. And with me here in New York is Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group.  </p><p> Zanny, let me ask you, you were at Davos.  I saw you there.  The mood was buoyant because of the growth.  Do the leaders deserve the credit for this synchronist global growth?  Are they right?  </p><p> ZANNY MINTON BEDDOES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ECONOMIST:  Well, collectively, they do deserve some credit.  I'm not sure Donald Trump deserves quite as much credit as he was taking.  But, yes, the global economy is absolutely buoyant and it's going to grow at a very strong level, very synchronized.  And I think as a result, there is in the short term quite a lot of sense of euphoria.  But underneath that, I think there are some deep concerns.  You highlighted some of them. But people breathed a sigh of relief that Donald Trump there was Trump on best behavior, Trump with the Teleprompter, and that reinforced the sense of relief and optimism and even euphoria that you had.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Rana, the best line I know about Davos I think Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, who says, \"Davos is where billionaires tell millionaires how the middle class feels.\"  The billionaires and millionaires were very happy.  But will it translate?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  I can't think of a way to put it better.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Will it translate to the middle class?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  You know, I think -- no, I have to agree with Jamie Dimon on this.  I think Davos is a counter indicator for how most of the population is feeling.  It's true, CEOs were buoyant.  And I spoke to many.  They are excited about the Trump tax cuts.  More than his speech, they were looking at what's been done so far.  The tax cuts and deregulation in the U.S.</p><p> My concern is really this is a short-term fix and a Band-Aid.  That tax cut didn't have a quid pro quo for the kind of real Main Street investment that we all want to see, infrastructure, long-term fixes to education, real CapEx spending.  The spending that I'm hearing that is going to be done by business is either happening in sectors not as labor intensive.  The technology sector will do a lot, but they don't employ a lot of people.  A lot of it will go into share buybacks. Again, that will bolster the wealth of the top 20 percent but that won't do a lot for the lower 80.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Ian Bremmer, you tweeted that this is not just this speech but the last couple of speeches that Trump has given on foreign policy, he's been remarkably sensible, which means he's actually stuck to the script in the Teleprompter.  </p><p> IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  There's no question Teleprompter Trump is better and more acceptable international than TwitterTrump.  The problem is that TwitterTrump is who Trump really is.  When you get him off of reading other peoples' words, you then have a problem.  If he could get out of his own way -- Christine Lagarde opened Davos this year saying not only is the economy doing better than any point in the last 10 years, but Trump's tax bill is a piece of the reason for that.  If he could sit back and let the economy do its work and let his many competent advisors work, it would be fine.  The big news this week is Trump tried to fire Mueller and he was being retrained.  Continually Trump is his worst enemy.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  It's all very fascinating.</p><p> Zanny, very quickly, do you think when you listen to all this what was going on at Davos, do you think that they were giving Trump credit? In other words, particularly European CEOs, whom you know very well, they are not very -- they are hostile to Trump, openly hostile.  Did they change their minds?  </p><p> [10:09:55]  MINTON BEDDOES:  They are openly hostile to many of the things Trump does, but delighted the fact their share prices are soaring, and the American economy is booming.  And I was struck by the degree to which European CEOs were very happy to say the tax cut was great for them, too.  I think CEOs are as quick to turn their tune as anybody else.  And I thought there was a remarkably quick shift in opinion there.  I agree with Rana that much of it is not justified and, hopefully, we can get on to that.  The mood there was remarkably upbeat.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Fascinating.  </p><p> We're going to come back and talk about something else, which is, other than Trump and geopolitics, there was a big story in Davos worth hearing about.  Rana Foroohar will explain when we come back, as will all the others.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [10:15:00]  ZAKARIA:  And we are back with \"The Economist's\" Zanny Minton Beddoes in London.  We have \"F.T.'s\" Rana Foroohar in Rome, and Ian Bremmer here in New York.  </p><p> Rana, you point out that if you look at the number of sessions, and much of the talk at Davos this year, it was about something else that people are actually very worried about.  Explain.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Absolutely.  A.I., big data, the digital revolution was the hot topic.  And what is interesting to me, it's been that way many years at Davos but this year you got the sense it was going way beyond the tech sector itself and going to every kind of business model.  I spoke to an insurance executive, for example, that told me sensors in cars and homes would enable his industry to write personalized policies.  That's also going to result in some kind of a digital underclass.  We've seen workers being left behind by technology.  We may see people that can't be insured or get health care policies.  </p><p> What is concerning is that the state will be, of course, left to pick up the pieces, but the state, as you've talked about in your column, and I'm talking about in my column in \"F.T.\" tomorrow, is it's very weak right now.  Politics are polarized.  Western liberal democratic states are being asked to do more than they can't.  What is interesting is more authoritarian states, like China, may actually be better positioned in the short term to manage this disruption.  But that also raises the specter of sort of an authoritarian technologically adept state that is wrecking privacy.  So lots of big political issues.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Zanny, my sense is the tech companies at Davos, who are usually the stars of the show, are also aware that this new sense that technology is, first of all, causing a lot of job losses, might be creating these monopolies, is ushering in a new wave of feelings about how to handle technology and big tech.  </p><p> MINTON BEDDOES:  I think that's absolutely right.  Rana is completely right.  There were lots of sessions on A.I. and how it will change jobs and lose jobs.  That's been a subject for some years at Davos. For me, the two new elements of tech were that there was a really powerful sense of a tech-lash, a political backlash against the big tech companies.  The Googles, Facebooks are no longer the great shining lights of western capitalism.  They are too big, too concentrated.  And all kinds of people are worried about that.  </p><p> And the second element, also slightly more worrying, is the number of people that said to me China is ahead of us in A.I. and we have a real problem.  The sense of A.I. as something as part of a geopolitical rift between -- or struggle for supremacy between China and the U.S.</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Ian, so there's always that undercurrent at Davos, as well. Is China gaining ground?  Is the United States losing out in the key sectors?  Again, on the surface, the American boom makes that seem not true, but what's your sense?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Chinese growth is adding a hell of a lot more to the global economy than American growth is at this point, and that continues to be the case every year.  Also, Chinese technology, driven by the state, as opposed to the United States.  Trump is talking about manufacturing jobs.  He's talking about coal.  He's not talking about investing in A.I.  That's a sector the Chinese want to dominate.  I think both of those really worry the Davos group, especially because the two dominant forces in A.I. in the world today are ideologically opposed to the multilateral developmental approach of Davos.  You've got the Libertarians in Silicon Valley and you have the authoritarian state capitals of Beijing.  That unnerves the folks in a really big way.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Rana, do you sense, as a result of all of this, you're going to have a Chinese-American clash?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  I think you are.  I think you're going to have a splinter net really.  You already see China going in a different direction than not only the U.S. but Europe in terms of how they are thinking about the Internet and regulating the Internet.  Very tight ties between the state and tech firms there.  An unlimited ability to collect data.  I spoke to several western data scientists that were sort of envious about how easy it is to collect data, which is, of course, the basis of A.I., in China, even as they were worried about the authoritarian impact of all that data collection.  So it is a very disruptive time to say the least.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  And, Zanny, let me ask you, and this is television and we have a minute.  Quickly, tell me why you chose to highlight the danger of not just conflict but actually of war in \"The Economist\" this week? </p><p> MINTON BEDDOES:  Two reasons.  We think there's a growing risk of great power conflict.  One is an immediate risk, North Korea.  We have a terrific piece that shows the risk of a preventive attack by the United States is probably much greater than many people think.  And secondly, all the things we've been talking about, a rising China, taking its place in the world, plus technological changes in the nature of warfare, we think makes the risk much greater than many people realize.  </p><p> [10:20:06]  ZAKARIA:  It's a terrific cover story.  You should all read it.</p><p> Thank you all.  Fascinating panel.</p><p> When we come back, my exclusive interview from Davos with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I'll ask him about the Iran deal, the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem, and about his own corruption scandal.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Welcome back to GPS.  I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you now from Davos, the small Swiss ski town that, for the last week, was home to the World Economic Forum.  Donald Trump's appearance here grabbed the biggest headlines by far.  But his fellow world leaders were out in full force.  </p><p> On Thursday, I interviewed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu onstage at the forum.  </p><p> It was almost two months ago that President Trump announced he was recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capitol, and that he hoped to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv.  Shortly thereafter, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to condemn America's decision. But this week, the administration doubled down.  Vice President Pence speaking at Israel's Knesset on Monday set a date saying the new embassy will open before 2019 is out.  What does it all mean for peace?  </p><p> Here is my interview with the prime minister.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [10:25:20]  ZAKARIA:  Prime Minister, pleasure to have you.  </p><p> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRALI PRIME MINISTER:  It's good to be with you again.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  President Trump did something that I'm sure you've wanted an American president to do for a long time, which is announce that the United States will move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  And the Arab leaders whom I talked to, who are not unsympathetic to Israel at this point, say, look, the reason we're opposed to this, this should be part of a final deal.  The status of Jerusalem should not be decided arbitrarily and unilaterally.  We want this solved but in a way that helps produce some kind of a permanent settlement.  Do you understand that point that people make?  </p><p> NETANYAHU:  I understand that they say it, but I think they are wrong. Let me tell you why.  Where is my office, the prime minister's office? In Jerusalem?  Right next to us is the Knesset, our parliament.  Where is that?  In Jerusalem.  Right next to that is the Supreme Court, the only real only independent Supreme Court in a very large radius in our turbulent region.  Where is that?  In Jerusalem?  The seat of government is in Jerusalem.  This has been the case for the 70 years of Israel's existence that we're celebrating ow.  Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people since the time of King David.  That's only 3,000 years ago.  So President Trump made history by recognizing history, recognizing these indelible facts of the past and the present.  And under any peace agreement, you know that the capital of Israel will continue to Jerusalem.  And the seat of our government will continue to be in Jerusalem.  </p><p> I think, on the contrary, he did a great service for peace because peace can only be based on truth, on reality.  And denying the simple fact Israel's capital is Jerusalem is -- pushes peace backward by creating an illusion, fantasy.  You can't build peace on fantasy.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  But about --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NETANYAHU:  It's a vision but it has to be grounded in reality.</p><p> ZAKARIA:  A number of Palestinians reacted to the Trump administration's decision by saying it appears that Benjamin Netanyahu is essentially signaling the end of the two-state solution, we should now move to a one-state solution.  What we now asked for, since we will never have our own state with our own capital, what we ask for is political rights since we live under Israeli sovereignty.  Mubarak (ph) said that.  Hamad Nashrali (ph) said that.  Is that a possible consequence of this, that the Palestinians will move to asking for a one-state solution?  </p><p> NETANYAHU:  I think it's a complete distortion.  I don't think they really mean it.  I think they want to govern themselves, which I don't have any problem with that.  </p><p> I'll tell you what my position is.  It's a simple one.  I haven't changed it, by the way.  From the day I gave the speech, the principles have always been the same.  The Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us, which means that, in any political arrangement, Israel must retain the overriding security control in the tiny area west of the Jordan, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean, because, otherwise, you'll have Daesh, ISIS come in, Hamas come in, which means Iran, and that's the end of peace.  That's the end of the Palestinian Authorities.  That's the end -- it could a perceptible, a powerful threat to the survival of Israel.  So I never mince words about that. Israel will retain the overriding security control.  But other than that, the Palestinians will be free to govern themselves.  I don't think there's a problem with that.  People say, yes, but if they don't have control over the military and security of things, that's not real sovereignty.  You can't have another country retain the military forces, you know, a former enemy.  How could that happen?  Well, how about American forces in Germany, almost 80 years after the fact, or in --  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Japan.  </p><p> NETANYAHU:  -- Japan and so on.  </p><p> We live in a complex world.  We have a mosaic of failed states in the Middle East.  We don't want to create another failed state.  And the key fundament of stability and of success and of peace is security. Israel will maintain that security for our benefit but also for the benefit of the Palestinians.  </p><p> ZAKARIA:  You know there are a number of people that say the problem with no progress on this issue is that, over time, you will have a vast number of Palestinians who live under Israeli sovereignty and, in that circumstance, Israel will not be able to be Jewish and democratic, that in other words, it will lose its democratic character because it will be ruling over a large group of people without giving them rights, or it will lose its Jewish character because of the number of Palestinians will overwhelm the number of Israeli Jews. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Do you -- do you buy that trade-off? </p><p> NETANYAHU:  I think there is a third option. I don't think we necessarily -- I don't want to annex the Palestinians as citizens of Israel, and I don't want to have them as our subjects. They can live in their own sphere, govern themselves with their own powers, their own parliament, their own flag, their -- embassies, what have you, the whole trappings, except the powers that are needed that we need to retain in order to protect ourselves. </p><p> And this is not a gimmick. It's not a spin. It's real. This is the kind of arrangement that we have to...</p><p> ZAKARIA:  But what country has ever done that? </p><p> You talk about Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan have -- have control over their military. They're not -- I mean, you're not -- if you were to give the Palestinians the deal the Germans got after World War II, the Palestinians would be happy. I mean, that's...</p><p> NETANYAHU:  No, actually, they say, \"We don't want any residual forces and residual military presence beyond, I don't know, two or three years.\" It's now going on 80 years that -- that the Americans are there. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  But Germany had -- you know, Germany has full sovereignty in its -- in military and defense. </p><p> NETANYAHU:  Well, I think that, when the Palestinians demonstrate that they can, you know, they can actually govern those territories and not have them taken over by Hamas or by ISIS, then come and ask me again.</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Is Jared Kushner going to make peace in the Middle East? </p><p> NETANYAHU:  If the Palestinians...</p><p> ZAKARIA:  President Trump says that he -- that he has a chance of doing it.</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Look, it's a very able team that the president has. They have many, many abilities. The thing that people don't realize is that these people have made their mark in the markets in real estate. Now, this is not only a real estate deal; it's fundamentally not a real estate deal but a problem of recognizing Israel's existence, the problem of not recognizing a Jewish state in any boundary. But it also has its real estate elements. And they're, I have to say, very creative, you know, and I wait to see what they'll put down, but I don't rule it out. Because I think we need peace. I think the Palestinians need peace. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Next on \"GPS,\" Iran. President Trump has said he has waived sanctions against that nation for the last time unless European allies get tougher on Iran. Has Obama's nuclear deal reached the beginning of its end? I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu when we come back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  The president said something quite dramatic recently, that he was not going to renew the waiver of sanctions on Iran, which means that, at some point, it is quite possible that the United States will unilaterally withdraw from the Iran deal. Then Iran would have the option, presumably, of beginning to enrich uranium again, go down a path, a nuclear path, again. </p><p> Isn't that a bad outcome for Israel? </p><p> NETANYAHU:  No. I think that the present deal is so deeply flawed that it guarantees that Iran will have what it needs to make nuclear weapons, including enrichment of fissile material, on a vast scale. This is what is problematic with the deal. It just gives them a timeline and it says, within X years, eight years, whatever, from now... </p><p> ZAKARIA:  But wouldn't it be better for you to have heard it be 15 years from now than next month? </p><p> NETANYAHU:  No, because what they can do today is at best enrich uranium for one weapon. Under the deal, they will be able to enrich uranium for 100, 200 bombs, and that's...</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Fifteen years from now?</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Maybe eight or 10. And they could break out, \"let's rush create a nuclear -- an arsenal of nuclear weapons,\" unimpeded by any international agreement. In fact, the agreement lets them do it. </p><p> So this is why the deal is so bad, because it gives Iran, the preeminent terrorist state of our time, the wherewithal to produce nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs. They could give it to proxies, terrorists; they could use it themselves. That's where we don't want to get to. </p><p> So I don't particularly care if they fix the deal or if they cancel the deal, keep it or nix it. The important part for me is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear arsenal, because Iran not only spreads terror worldwide; Iran openly says that it's going to use those weapons and use every weapon they have to annihilate Israel. We're not going to let that happen. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  When you talk to European leaders, certainly when I've talked to European leaders, and certainly their public statements, they say they support the deal; they do not see any reason to amend it. They believe Iran is in compliance with the deal and they think it produces stability. </p><p> So when you talk to them and say \"Fix the deal,\" do they tell you, \"Yes, we're going to fix the deal,\" or do they say what they're saying publicly, which is, \"The deal is good; there's no -- there's nothing to -- no fixing needs to be done?\" </p><p> NETANYAHU:  Well, I'll tell you what I tell them, you know...</p><p> ZAKARIA:  What I'm hoping is you'll tell me what they tell you privately. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Well, I'm sure you do. But I can say that the fact that they signed a bad deal doesn't mean that they have to keep a bad deal. In history, when you've had instances of nations signing very bad deals and living, if they manage to live, to regret it -- there was such a deal, by the way, most recently with North Korea. They had a deal. Everybody said, \"That's it, you know, the North Koreans will keep the deal and it will prevent North Korea from having nuclear weapons; they will join the community of nations.\" So much for that. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  But wouldn't we all...</p><p> NETANYAHU:  They signed a deal. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Wouldn't we wish for a deal, given that there are inspectors in Iran; given that it's much more difficult to -- are you comfortable with an Iran that -- where there's no deal and it can do whatever it wants to...</p><p> NETANYAHU:  I don't think -- I don't think it can do everything. First of all, the inspections are -- are deeply flawed because Iran says you cannot inspect military sites. So if you're the Iranian regime, where do you think you're going to do your weaponization? Where do you think you're going to do the other elements of a secret nuclear program? In military sites. But they say you can't inspect it. This is one example of how flawed this deal is. </p><p> Secondly, look, Iran doesn't rush forward to make nuclear weapons because they can suffer crippling sanctions. That brought them to --- to their senses last time, a number of times. Second, they also might think, correctly, that if they try to rush for a bomb, there will be countries that would prevent them. I don't want to speak in the name of another country, but I guarantee you I speak in my name; we will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  When you look at the Middle East -- you and I have talked about this before -- it seems as though...</p><p> NETANYAHU:  And, by the way, the Arab states -- again, unnamed -- the Arab states, unnamed, agree with me. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  So we are just about to name them. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> It seems as though...</p><p> NETANYAHU:  You want to name the unnamed states? </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Exactly.</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Go ahead, name the unnamed states. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  It seems as though Israel is today in a closer strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and Egypt than at any point in its history, and that at this point, that is the defining feature of the Middle East, a kind of anti-Iran alliance in which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel are the crucial players. Would you agree? </p><p> NETANYAHU:  I'd agree that there is an alignment of Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. And certainly, in my lifetime, I never saw anything like it, and I'm at the age of the state of Israel, more or less, so it's an extraordinary thing. </p><p> Yes, it starts with a common concern with a common enemy, which is radical Islam, either of the radical Sunnis, Daesh, before that Al Qaida, which Israel fights, and has prevented, by the way, dozens of terrorist, major terrorist attacks not only in the Middle East but throughout the world and saved the lives of many, many citizens, because our intel is second to none, and also our common stance against Iran. </p><p> That's one source. What is not recognized is that there is another source of this closeness and it's their desire to make use of the civilian technology that Israel has, in water or in agriculture, or in I.T. and other areas to better the lives -- health -- to better the lives of their citizens. I view that as a great promise for peace. I think it's changing attitudes not only on the level of the regimes. We poll the Arab world; we see the beginning of changes, significant change in the attitude towards Israel in the Arab publics -- not all of them, and not yet majorities, but significant minorities. That's hope. That's a future of peace. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Up next, I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu about himself, specifically the criminal probes that are swirling around him and his associates. He has already been questioned numerous times by Israeli authorities. What happens next? </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\" That's a quote not from Donald Trump about the Russia investigation but from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It's become a mantra of sorts for him when he's asked to comment on the investigations swirling around him. </p><p> The Israeli police named Netanyahu a suspect in two cases involving bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He's been interviewed multiple times by authorities and his former chief of staff agreed last summer to testify against Prime Minister Netanyahu. </p><p> Here, again, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Mr. Prime Minister, you -- you will understand I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask this question. It's about your own political future. You face in Israel serious investigations. How should the world see this? Should the world look at this and say, \"This is Israeli democracy at work, where no one is above the law, above scrutiny, above investigation, or do you regard this as a political witch hunt?\"</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Well, no one is above the law in Israel, and that's the case in this case, too. But I'm also confident that nothing will come of it because there's nothing to come out. So I think that it's just a question of time. And next year -- yeah, invite me next year; we'll do it once a year...</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ... and you'll see if I'm proven right. You'll see that I am.</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Finally, you just came back from a trip to India. </p><p> NETANYAHU:  Yeah. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  Tell us what is it that all these countries that you have now been going to that are deepening their ties with Israel -- what is it that they are trying to get from Israel?</p><p> NETANYAHU:  Two things: they want security, protection against terrorism. And Israel is second to none in providing this valuable intelligence that has also prevented, for example, planes from being blown out in the sky. That's not only a problem for the country that suffers that tragedy but for all international civil aviation. Israel has been the leading force to protect the lives and the -- the critical facilities of many, many states. That's the first thing. Everybody wants that. Because the firmaments of -- the sparks of radical Islam are flying into every continent and to every country.</p><p> The second thing that they want is the future. It's not only to push back the bad; it's to seize the good. We're in a world of tremendous change. I mean, you've been talking about it. It's basically the confluence of big data, artificial intelligence and connectivity that's changing industries. Israel has a car industry within a matter of years. We make -- 85 percent of the value of a car is soon going to be software. And all the other stuff, you know, the body, the chassis, the tires, the engine, that's minuscule. So essentially cars are computers on wheels. Now we have a car industry, because there we compete.</p><p> So an Israeli company, right next to my office in Jerusalem, has just been sold to Intel for $15 billion for autonomous vehicle technology. This technology is produced in Israel, but Israel is also not only an I.T. power; it's a water -- water power. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NETANYAHU:  No, not only that; we -- we recycle almost 90 percent of our waste water. The runner-up is Spain with about 20 percent, just to understand. So if you're a country that needs water and you can recycle your waste water, you come to Israel. So this is -- this is a revolution. Israel, you know, we're working to build up the life of the Jewish state and afford us a future of prosperity and progress and peace. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  Next week on \"GPS,\" don't miss my interview with King Abdullah II of Jordan, here in Davos. Mark your calendars.  Next up, today on \"GPS,\" many years ago the political scientist Samuel Huntington coined the term \"Davos man\" to describe the average attendee at the World Economic Forum here in Davos. But in this era of further female empowerment, is \"Davos man\" making way for \"Davos woman?\" This year the seven co-chairs of the meeting were all women. Was it just window dressing? When we come back.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ZAKARIA:  My book of the week is Christopher Hayes' \"Twilight of the Elites.\" I happened to bring Hayes' brilliant book along with me to read while milling around the World Economic Forum with Davos men and Davos women. It's a highly intelligent and even profound reflection on the problems with our current system of meritocracy that has so divided almost all our societies. </p><p> And now, the last look from here in Davos, where there is some history being made. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (UNKNOWN):  It's fascinating to see...</p><p> ZAKARIA (voice over):  All seven of the gathering's co-chairs this year are women. They're top leaders in business, finance, science and social entrepreneurship. </p><p> (UNKNOWN):  You have to talk about prosperity. </p><p> ZAKARIA:  All seven co-chairs gathered on stage at an opening session, and one of them, the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, quipped that something was out of the ordinary. </p><p> CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF:  But it's a bit of a change from the \"manels\" panels...</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ... that have been had on occasions.</p><p> ZAKARIA:  But progress in gender at the top of Davos doesn't fully trickle down to the ranks of attendees. The World Economic Forum itself admits 21 percent of this year's 3,000 participants are women. While that's an improvement over past years, several female attendees voiced their frustration at the lopsided gender balance in these halls. </p><p> The WEF's gender gap report is an annual publication that charts the progress of more than 100 countries toward gender equality. The most recent report for 2017 notes that the global gender gap has overall widened for the first time since they started measuring more than a decade ago. </p><p> The report also suggests that, based on current data, it will be 100 years before most countries have closed their overall gender gaps and 217 years to close the economic gap, including workforce precipitation and salary between men and women. </p><p> Where did the United States fall on the 2017 gender gap? Well, it is in 49th place in the survey, its worst ranking in the history of the survey. Number one on the current rankings is Iceland, which recently passed legislation forcing companies to prove that any wage difference between employees is not due to gender. And on the survey's political empowerment subindex, which measures the gap between men and women at the highest levels of political decision-making, the U.S. was in the lower half of the pack, coming in at 96, between Pakistan and Vietnam. </p><p> Now, don't forget we have just launched the \"GPS\" challenge online. Every Sunday we'll post on our website 10 questions that will challenge your knowledge of the world. See how well you do. Go to cnn.com/fareedquiz and try your hand. </p><p> And thanks to all of you for being part of this program. I will see you next week. </p><p> [Byline: Fareed Zakaria] [Guest: Benjamin Netanyahu] [High: Interview with Benjamin Netanyahu.] [Spec: Israel; Middle East; Davos; Economy; Donald Trump]</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.
