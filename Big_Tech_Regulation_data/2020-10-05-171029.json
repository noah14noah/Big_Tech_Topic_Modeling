Antitrust actions against the company may take place at the state level despite a lack of concern that the company violates federal antitrust law. Watch Amazon[2] trade live.Amazon bulls may face a rude awakening from state-level antitrust actions against the e-commerce giant. </p><p>A report from D.A. Davidson .... Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte notes the company has taken actions to steer clear of federal anti-trust violations, though state-level concerns may pose the greater threat. While Forte did not spell out specifics on a state-level regulatory attack, he did cite Sucharita Mulpuru, head of e-commerce and retail at Forrester Research, on the issue. \"According to Forrester, the federal government, more than likely, will not do anything to slow/stop Amazon,\" Forte wrote. \"More likely the regulatory changes will occur at the state level and, ultimately, make their way to the Supreme Court, similar to online sales tax legislation.\" The ruling, which forces online retailers to collect state-level taxes regardless of where they are based[3], originated with a state-level case filed by South Dakota. A ruling by the Supreme Court then applied it at the federal level. By the time of the Supreme Court ruling, Amazon was already paying the tax in the 45 states in which it operated. However, its early growth was, for many years, spurred by the ability for consumers to avoid sales tax[4] by purchasing online. One of the actions taken to avoid federal antitrust action was the removal of a \"most-favored nation\" clause in Amazon's agreements with third-party sellers. The clause required sellers to agree not to sell their products at prices lower than those listed on Amazon. The clause was dropped silently by the retailer after a letter from Senator Richard Blumenthal[5] highlighted the practice as anti-competitive. A bonus just for you:Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business InsiderPRIME[6] Amazon is clearly aware of the regulatory risks it faces, highlighting evolving government regulation as a top risk in the its annual 10-K filing[7]. While the company does not highlight state-level actors, such as regulators and attorney generals, the company does note the risks of future actions in its filing. \"Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions interpreting or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business,\" the filing said. Given the many state-level politicians fighting for media attention, an antitrust action against the company would surely gain notice as well as support from many quarters. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been particularly outspoken on the issue[8], publishing an open letter titled, \"Here's how we can break up Big Tech[9].\" \"Here's what willchange: Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business,\" Warren wrote. Amazon[10] is up 21% this year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partnerNOW\">https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partnerNOW</url> WATCH: Here's what can happen if you hold your pee too long[11]See Also: Don't fret about the right time to get to the airport.

Davidson &amp; Co. Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte notes the company has taken actions to steer clear of federal anti-trust violations, though state-level concerns may pose the greater threat. While Forte did not spell out specifics on a state-level regulatory attack, he did cite Sucharita Mulpuru, head of e-commerce and retail at Forrester Research, on the issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"According to Forrester, the federal government, more than likely, will not do anything to slow/stop Amazon,\" Forte wrote. \"More likely the regulatory changes will occur at the state level and, ultimately, make their way to the Supreme Court, similar to online sales tax legislation.\"</p><p>The ruling, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-supreme-court-rules-for-states-in-online-sales-tax-case-2018-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">forces online retailers to collect state-level taxes regardless of where they are based</url>, originated with a state-level case filed by South Dakota. A ruling by the Supreme Court then applied it at the federal level.</p><p>By the time of the Supreme Court ruling, Amazon was already paying the tax in the 45 states in which it operated. However, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-supreme-court-sales-tax-ruling-2018-6?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">its early growth was, for many years, spurred by the ability for consumers to avoid sales tax</url> by purchasing online.</p><p>One of the actions taken to avoid federal antitrust action was the removal of a \"most-favored nation\" clause in Amazon's agreements with third-party sellers. The clause required sellers to agree not to sell their products at prices lower than those listed on Amazon. The clause was dropped silently by the retailer after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/12.19.18%20-%20DOJ%20-%20Price%20Parity.pdf\">a letter from Senator Richard Blumenthal</url> highlighted the practice as anti-competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A bonus just for you:\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Click here to claim 30 days of access to Business Insider\u00a0PRIME</emphasis></p><p>Amazon is clearly aware of the regulatory risks it faces, highlighting evolving government regulation as a top risk in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872419000004/amzn-20181231x10k.htm\">its annual 10-K filing</url>. While the company does not highlight state-level actors, such as regulators and attorney generals, the company does note the risks of future actions in its filing.</p><p>\"Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions interpreting or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business,\" the filing said.\u00a0</p><p>Given the many state-level politicians fighting for media attention, an antitrust action against the company would surely gain notice as well as support from many quarters.

If he testifies before the committee, it will be Mr. Bezos' first appearance before Congress.</p><p>  The chief executives of the other companies under investigation by lawmakers -- Apple, Facebook and Google -- have all testified at various points in recent years on other matters. The House Judiciary Committee has been pushing for them to return to testify in front of its investigation, too.</p><p>  In the letter sent on Sunday, Robert K. Kelner of the law firm Covington &amp; Burling, which is representing Amazon before the congressional investigation, said the company was ''committed to cooperating with your inquiry and will make the appropriate executive available to testify.''</p><p>  He added: ''This includes making Jeff Bezos available to testify at a hearing with the other C.E.O.s this summer.''</p><p>  The letter was reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>  The congressional investigation is part of a larger backlash among lawmakers and law enforcement officials against the power and reach of large tech companies. The Justice Department is said to be preparing to bring an antitrust case against Google this year, while the Federal Trade Commission is pursuing its own inquiry into Facebook's acquisition of nascent competitors.</p><p>Amazon faces scrutiny from regulators around the world. The European Union is preparing to bring antitrust charges against the company over accusations that it has drawn on data from third-party merchants who use its site to build its own business for generic products. State attorneys general in California and Washington, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, have also been pursuing inquiries into the company's use of its market power.</p><p>  In recent weeks, the Judiciary Committee has pushed the companies under investigation to answer whether their chief executives would be willing to appear before the panel. But Mr. Bezos is the only executive lawmakers have publicly threatened to legally compel to appear.</p><p>  Mr. Kelner said Mr. Bezos' availability was dependent on first resolving several issues, including timing, format and questions about the committee's request for internal documents.</p><p>  Other Amazon executives might also be suited to testify, Mr. Kelner suggested in the letter, saying they and not Mr. Bezos now ran aspects of the business that are the subject of the investigation.</p><p>  ''We look forward to continuing our good-faith discussion with the committee to resolve these important issues,'' Mr. Kelner said.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately comment on the letter. Facebook and Apple did not immediately say whether their chief executives had committed to testifying at a hearing. A spokeswoman for Google, Julie Tarallo McAlister, declined to comment.</p><p>  An appearance by Mr. Bezos on Capitol Hill would attract significant attention. He has increased his profile in Washington in recent years, renovating a mansion in the city's Kalorama neighborhood. President Trump has focused his criticism on him and tried to link Amazon to The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos also owns but is not a subsidiary of the retailer.</p><p>  The House investigation has been in progress for a year. At a hearing last year, an Amazon lawyer said the company did not use data from its outside sellers to inform its own product decisions. His answer was later called into question by a news article in The Wall Street Journal, prompting some lawmakers to call for possible sanctions against Amazon and push harder for Mr. Bezos' testimony. Amazon has denied misleading lawmakers.</p><p>  Last fall, the lawmakers asked all four companies to provide them with internal documents, including communications between prominent executives.</p><p>  In addition to his comments on Mr. Bezos' willingness to testify, Mr. Kelner's letter to the lawmakers expressed concerns about the breadth of the panel's document requests to Amazon. He criticized the committees's ''shifting demands'' and said the company was concerned that the panel would not protect its confidential information.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A House panel is likely to question Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, about claims that his company, Amazon, boxes out small businesses, abuses its power and mistreats warehouse workers.

(Dow Jones) -- Amazon.com modified its product search system so that its electronic page predominantly presents listings that are most profitable for the company, said people who worked on the project -- a measure, controversial in a way which could favor Amazon's brands.</p><p><br/><br/>Late last year, these people said, Amazon optimized the secret algorithm that classifies lists so that, instead of primarily showing consumers the most relevant and best-selling lists when searching -- as it had done -- as it had done -- for more than a decade -- the site also gives a boost to items that are most profitable for the company.<br/><br/>The adjustment, which the world's largest online retailer has not published, followed a years-old battle between executives leading Amazon's Seattle retail business and the company's search team, called A9, in Palo AltoCalifornia, which opposed the measure, people said.<br/><br/>Any adjustment to Amazon's search system has broad implications because the giant's ranking can drive or cause a product to fail. The site search bar is the most common way for U.S. buyers to find items online, and most purchases come from the first search results page, according to marketing analytics firm Jumpshot.<br/><br/>The problem is particularly sensitive because the United States and the European Union are examining Amazon's dual role -- as a market operator and seller of its own branded products. A profit-swell algorithm could stifle customers toward Amazon's thousands of internal products that offer higher profit margins than competing listings that appear on the site.<br/><br/>Amazon's lawyers rejected an initial proposal on how to add profits directly to the algorithm, saying this represented a change that could create problems with antitrust regulators, said one of the people familiar with the Project.<br/><br/>The opinion of the Amazon search team was that the increase in profitability violated the company's principle of doing what's best for the customer, people familiar with the project said. \"This was definitely not a popular project,\" said one of them. \"The search engine is supposed to look for relevant items, not more profitable items.\"<br/><br/>Amazon said that for many years it has considered long-term profitability and that it analyzes the impact of implementing an algorithm. \"We haven't changed the criteria we use to rank search results to include profitability,\" said Angie Newman, Amazon's spokeswoman, in a statement sent by email.<br/><br/>Amazon declined to say why A9 engineers considered the emphasis on profitability to be a significant change in the algorithm, and declined to discuss the inner workings of its algorithm or internal discussions related to it, including objections of the company's lawyers.<br/><br/>Change could also drive branded productsor third-party listings on the site that could be more profitable than Amazon products. The algorithm also emphasizes long-standing metrics, such as unit sales. People who worked on the project said they didn't know how much the shift to Amazon's brands has helped.<br/><br/>Amazon's Newman said, \"Amazon designs its shopping and discovery experience to deliver the products customers will want, regardless of whether they are our brands or products offered by our selling partners.\"<br/><br/>Antitrust regulators for decades have focused on whether companies use their market power to undermine competition. Amazon avoided scrutiny in part because its competitive merchant market causes prices to fall.<br/><br/>Now, some lawmakers are asking Washington to reconsider antitrust law to take into account the influence of big tech companies. In the case of Amazon, they have said that it can modify its dominant platform to favor its products.<br/><br/>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat for Massachusetts) has argued that Amazon suffocates small businesses by unfairly promoting its own-branded products and low-priced competitors. Amazon has disputed this claim.<br/><br/>During a House of Representatives antitrust hearing last July, lawmakers questioned Amazon about whether it was using data obtained from other vendors to favor its own products. \"The best purchase for you is an Amazon product,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat for Rhode Island). \"No, that's not true,\" said Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, saying that \"Amazon's algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy independently of the seller.\"<br/><br/>Leaders of the House Judiciary Committee recently called on Amazon to provide executive communications related to product searches on the site as part of an investigation into anti-competitive behavior technology companies.<br/><br/>Amazon says it operates in fiercely competitive markets, this accounts for less than 1% of global retail and its private label business accounts for approximately 1% of its retail sales.<br/><br/>Amazon executives have sought to increase profitability in their retail business after years of focusing on growth. Most of its $12.4 billion operating revenue last year came from its growing cloud computing business.<br/><br/><br/>Translated by Luis Felipe Cedillo<br/><br/>Edited by Michelle del Campo<br/><br/>Copyright \u00a9 2019 Dow Jones &amp;Company;, Inc.

The e-commerce company's space venture won Federal Communications Commission approval last month to launch more than 3,200 low-Earth-orbit satellites over the next nine years. The proposed network, called Project Kuiper, takes a well-worn path pursued by rivals including billionaire Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., OneWeb and other companies that have tried to take satellite broadband service mainstream.    Those companies got a head start on Amazon, which has yet to launch a single satellite. Mr. Musk's company, known as SpaceX, has launched dozens of satellites this year. The closely held company has tapped the private market several times to fund its rocket business and the new communications network, called Starlink. SpaceX and Amazon both promise their technology can provide more internet bandwidth at a lower price than existing satellite operators.    \"Technologically, it can be done,\" said Gabriel Rebeiz, a wireless-communications professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"It's really a financial thing. Once you build it, is it economically viable?\"    Amazon is under less pressure than other satellite companies to show investors its service will turn a quick profit. The Seattle company, which generated nearly $90 billion in revenue last quarter, said in a blog post last month that it plans to steer more than $10 billion toward Kuiper over the coming years as it posts hundreds of jobs for the unit.    Amazon told regulators its satellites could help bridge the digital divide by bringing high-speed broadband to areas that lack competitive internet service. Amazon spokesman James Watkins declined to specify the company's expected customer base but confirmed that the network will serve households as well as businesses.    The company promised in its FCC application to \"leverage its considerable engineering resources, global operational capabilities and cost-conscious approach\" to give customers \"an affordable, high-quality broadband experience.\"    Amazon isn't the first big tech company to try bypassing traditional internet providers. Google owner Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. have launched projects that deliver connections over fiber-optic cables, solar-powered drones and lighter-than-air balloons, with mixed success on a small scale.    Some industry officials say the Kuiper effort comes with significant technical hurdles, high costs of deploying so many satellites and a steep drop-off in potential markets because of the coronavirus pandemic.    Project Kuiper is designed to cut latency -- the time it takes for the machines to communicate back and forth -- by maintaining an Earth-hugging orbit that circles the globe much more quickly than other satellites. That close-to-home real estate forces the system to maintain thousands of satellites to ensure customers on the ground are constantly in range.    The FCC approval followed the bankruptcy of OneWeb Global Ltd., widely seen as one of the leaders in seeking to provide global internet connectivity through a constellation of satellites. Financed largely by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. and European aerospace giant Airbus SE, OneWeb succeeded in mass-producing small satellites faster and cheaper than any company before. Still, the business plan suffered as its overall project costs surged and the development of inexpensive ground equipment faltered.    Months before its bankruptcy, OneWeb jettisoned its initial concept of pursuing consumers and small businesses in developing regions in favor of serving cruise-line, aviation and other established markets able to pay higher service fees.    Those potential markets are now reeling from the pandemic. Veteran space-industry consultant Roger Rusch, who has criticized low-orbiting constellations as exceedingly expensive to deploy and typically in need of replacement within a few years, said Amazon's project appears to take an approach similar to earlier efforts by committing to huge upfront investments before revenue starts to flow.    \"I haven't seen anything that differentiates it,\" he said. In the past, he added, proponents of such projects \"got into trouble because they didn't fully understand the magnitude of what they were trying to do.\"    Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos personally owns a rocket company, Blue Origin Federation LLC, which could help keep a lid on launch costs. Mr. Watkins said the company is considering all options for launch services.    Steve Collar, chief executive of Luxembourg-based satellite service provider SES SA, said the \"eye-watering\" cost of launching orbiters and making new home receivers will probably limit the profitability of low-Earth-orbit satellites outside the U.S.    \"Jeff Bezos, I'm sure, has a business plan,\" Mr. Collar said in an interview. \"But you certainly need to have a very long time horizon. Because $10 billion isn't where it stops.\"    Mr. Collar previously led O3b, another satellite company founded to connect the Earth's three billion people without access to true broadband. High costs led the company to focus on a smaller customer market before it merged with SES.    SpaceX's satellite-internet service has struggled with delays and high costs. The broadband service had initially planned to go online as early as 2018, according to internal documents previously viewed by The Wall Street Journal. A SpaceX spokesman declined to comment.    Project Kuiper has so far only secured U.S. approval for its satellite network and will need other regulators' assent before it can provide service in more countries. The system's design would cover most of the U.S. except for parts of Alaska.    Some telecom industry insiders assumed Amazon would use its satellites to connect far-flung data centers and offer fat data pipes to major customers in the corporate world and government sector. Prof. Rebeiz said Project Kuiper, like other satellite companies, will probably sell a large amount of its network capacity to military clients. Amazon's cloud-computing division already holds a unit devoted to serving data-center resources for military and aerospace clients.    Viasat Inc. Chief Executive Mark Dankberg said his company, which serves about 600,000 broadband customers from satellites stationed at higher orbits, offers the best model for consumers demanding more data capacity above all else. He said Amazon's low-latency connections will appeal more to businesses.    \"Amazon can fund whatever they want in this,\" Mr. Dankberg said at a recent investor conference hosted online. \"On the other hand, they also tend to be pretty rational. They don't waste capital. So I don't think they will underprice bandwidth that they bring to market.\"    Write to Drew FitzGerald at <email

That's because this distribution center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits from nearby politicians, isn't a jumping-off point for Macy's or Target. Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com.</p><p><br/> The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000.<br/> The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the \"need\" to raise taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to fund \"infrastructure\" jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other areas.<br/> The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.com touting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I've heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what might be fewer jobs than it claims\u2026 and possibly for destroying more jobs than it creates.<br/> Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon's PR department was ready for the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That's a good thing for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level job.<br/> But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but with a similar \"low prices\" kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in 2011).<br/> Whatever the companies' similarities, the differences between the two couldn't be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for investors, as well as for the future of our economy.<br/> On one hand, you have companies like TJX\u2014so-called \"bricks and mortar\" retailers\u2014which in order to do business every day must staff a few thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other ordinary features of a quality retail facility.<br/> Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee. But that's about all they have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as many customers from only a fraction of the locations\u2014and a fraction of the manpower\u2014that their competitors require. On just about every front, the company is more efficient than its peers. But let's look specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail company: its plant and its people.<br/> Facilities<br/> Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That's not a big-box retailer like Best Buy, which racked up $25 million per store in 2011, but it's solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers (like Sears, with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5 million per outlet).<br/>Amazon doesn't have stores, of course. It has \"fulfillment centers,\" just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May 2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including 37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe:<br/> Of course, it's unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the company handles customer service at separate locations, something a retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only a small fraction of TJX's business). Add in those locations, plus the newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100 retail operations centers globally.<br/> If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon's sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about 80 times the sales per location of a TJX.<br/> In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and FedEx will service them\u2014no need for high-rent districts with lots of shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and the same). Amazon's negotiation power and economies of scale are both significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront retailer.<br/> Employment<br/> Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes, but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business. But here too, Amazon's differences are broadly apparent.<br/>TJX Companies Inc. has approximately 179,000 employees: as with any retailer, it's a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers.<br/>Amazon's demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn't specify how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being 30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number of them would not be full-time, year-round positions.<br/> (Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts and on short notice\u2014a more difficult task for traditional storefront retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight to 6 a.m. doesn't help move any more product. So it's reasonable to assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most other retailers.)<br/> In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX's workforce. To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about five times more efficient than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer.<br/>Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail location\u2014especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400\u2014and many other aspects of the business share this limitation.<br/> Stacking Up Against Retail's Big Boys<br/>TJX wasn't cherry-picked as a counterexample\u2014there are many retailers with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don't put a dent in the revenue-per-employee figure:<br/> As is obvious above, Amazon's revenue per employee is leaps and bounds above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues from its insurance programs, so it's partially miscategorized. Even so, it still doesn't come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency; CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a single staffer in order to catch up.<br/>Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close.<br/>Amazon's revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard. And it's one of the reasons that despite a long track record of underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the market's good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is\u2014a technology company with leverage that can grow revenues in a big way\u2014and not a more traditional retailer.<br/> But this also means that for every jar of Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target\u2026 or one-fifth that of TJX.<br/> What Does This Mean for the President's Jobs Plan?<br/> Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are choked and bridges are crumbling.<br/> At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That's the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday's commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio.<br/> And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon \"creates,\" four other jobs go away at a company like TJX.<br/> But it's not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each other\u2014an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book The Innovator's Dilemma (available at Amazon.com, of course) that at one point the commonplace hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn't\u2014and still can't\u2014dig nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn't matter. They won the overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value of their improvements.<br/> Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon's relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its INefficiency. For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different trucks.<br/>TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly inefficient.<br/> What Amazon doesn't spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous.<br/> In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this graph of Amazon's gross revenue and its profits for the past five years...<br/> You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits. The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be it through FedEx drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities\u2014from building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all that money.<br/> Even if the company was profitable, the same would be true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending.<br/> Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going to reduce employment in the affected industry. That's the breaks. But it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever.<br/> A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation, aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant and serious dent in the demand for labor\u2014we've already seen it with low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors.<br/> Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers\u2014services contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and you'll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental, through technology.<br/> The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate, or which otherwise impede the flow of capital\u2014i.e., those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners.<br/> Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth.<br/> If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues, they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value of our money and security of our savings.<br/> Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other employment opportunities will fill the gaps created.<br/> Plus, it's not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all, Costco\u2014the star quarterback of the big-box store movement\u2014generates over $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could still learn a few things.<br/> As for the question of whether more efficient companies\u2014which employ software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly every year) to save on labor\u2014destroy more jobs than they create\u2026 it's not as simple as it might seem at first. Innovation ultimately benefits society, so we must be careful not to hamper it for fear of the unknown future it will bring.<br/> While technology jobs pose a conundrum for politicians, companies like Amazon will continue to grow their market share and make handsome profits for investors.

The Technology Jobs Conundrum By Alex Daley, Chief Technology Investment Strategist August 2, 2013 (Investorideas.com newswire) The past few weeks have seen the tech and business media abuzz about a not-so-little warehouse in Tennessee. That's because this distribution center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits from nearby politicians, isn't a jumping-off point for Macy's or Target. Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com. The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000. The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the \"need\" to raise taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to fund \"infrastructure\" jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other areas. </p><p>The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.com touting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I've heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what might be fewer jobs than it claims\u2026 and possibly for destroying more jobs than it creates. Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon's PR department was ready for the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That's a good thing for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level job. But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but with a similar \"low prices\" kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in 2011). Whatever the companies' similarities, the differences between the two couldn't be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for investors, as well as for the future of our economy. On one hand, you have companies like TJX\u2014so-called \"bricks and mortar\" retailers\u2014which in order to do business every day must staff a few thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other ordinary features of a quality retail facility. Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee. But that's about all they have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as many customers from only a fraction of the locations\u2014and a fraction of the manpower\u2014that their competitors require. On just about every front, the company is more efficient than its peers. But let's look specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail company: its plant and its people.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facilities</emphasis>Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That's not a big-box retailer like Best Buy, which racked up $25 million per store in 2011, but it's solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers (like Sears, with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5 million per outlet). Amazon doesn't have stores, of course. It has \"fulfillment centers,\" just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May 2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including 37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe: Of course, it's unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the company handles customer service at separate locations, something a retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only a small fraction of TJX's business). Add in those locations, plus the newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100 retail operations centers globally. If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon's sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about 80 times the sales per location of a TJX. In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and FedEx will service them\u2014no need for high-rent districts with lots of shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and the same). Amazon's negotiation power and economies of scale are both significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront retailer.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Employment</emphasis>Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes, but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business. But here too, Amazon's differences are broadly apparent. TJX Companies Inc. has approximately 179,000 employees: as with any retailer, it's a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers. Amazon's demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn't specify how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being 30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number of them would not be full-time, year-round positions. (Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts and on short notice\u2014a more difficult task for traditional storefront retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight to 6 a.m. doesn't help move any more product. So it's reasonable to assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most other retailers.) In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX's workforce. To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about five times more efficient than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer. Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail location\u2014especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400\u2014and many other aspects of the business share this limitation.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stacking Up Against Retail's Big Boys</emphasis>TJX wasn't cherry-picked as a counterexample\u2014there are many retailers with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don't put a dent in the revenue-per-employee figure: As is obvious above, Amazon's revenue per employee is leaps and bounds above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues from its insurance programs, so it's partially miscategorized. Even so, it still doesn't come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency; CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a single staffer in order to catch up. Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close. Amazon's revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard. And it's one of the reasons that despite a long track record of underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the market's good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is\u2014a technology company with leverage that can grow revenues in a big way\u2014and not a more traditional retailer. But this also means that for every jar of Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target\u2026 or one-fifth that of TJX.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What Does This Mean for the President's Jobs Plan?</emphasis>Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are choked and bridges are crumbling. At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That's the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday's commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio. And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon \"creates,\" four other jobs go away at a company like TJX. But it's not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each other\u2014an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book The Innovator's Dilemma (available at Amazon.com, of course) that at one point the commonplace hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn't\u2014and still can't\u2014dig nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn't matter. They won the overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value of their improvements. Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon's relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its INefficiency. For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different trucks. TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly inefficient. What Amazon doesn't spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous. In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this graph of Amazon's gross revenue and its profits for the past five years... You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits. The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be it through FedEx drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities\u2014from building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all that money. Even if the company was profitable, the same would be true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending. Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going to reduce employment in the affected industry. That's the breaks. But it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever. A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation, aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant and serious dent in the demand for labor\u2014we've already seen it with low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors. Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers\u2014services contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and you'll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental, through technology. The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate, or which otherwise impede the flow of capital\u2014i.e., those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners. Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth. If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues, they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value of our money and security of our savings. Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other employment opportunities will fill the gaps created. Plus, it's not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all, Costco\u2014the star quarterback of the big-box store movement\u2014generates over $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could still learn a few things. As for the question of whether more efficient companies\u2014which employ software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly every year) to save on labor\u2014destroy more jobs than they create\u2026 it's not as simple as it might seem at first. Innovation ultimately benefits society, so we must be careful not to hamper it for fear of the unknown future it will bring. While technology jobs pose a conundrum for politicians, companies like Amazon will continue to grow their market share and make handsome profits for investors.

That's because this distribution center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits from nearby politicians, isn't a jumping-off point for Macy's or Target. Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com[1].</p><p><br/> The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000.<br/> The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the \"need\" to raise taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to fund \"infrastructure\" jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other areas.<br/> The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.com[2] touting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I've heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what might be fewer jobs than it claims\u2026 and possibly for destroying more jobs than it creates.<br/> Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon's PR department was ready for the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That's a good thing for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level job.<br/> But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but with a similar \"low prices\" kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in 2011).<br/> Whatever the companies' similarities, the differences between the two couldn't be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for investors, as well as for the future of our economy.<br/> On one hand, you have companies like TJX\u2014so-called \"bricks and mortar\" retailers\u2014which in order to do business every day must staff a few thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other ordinary features of a quality retail facility.<br/> Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee. But that's about all they have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as many customers from only a fraction of the locations\u2014and a fraction of the manpower\u2014that their competitors require. On just about every front, the company is more efficient than its peers. But let's look specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail company: its plant and its people.<br/>Facilities<br/>Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That's not a big-box retailer like Best Buy[3], which racked up $25 million per store in 2011, but it's solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers (like Sears[4], with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5 million per outlet).<br/>Amazon doesn't have stores, of course. It has \"fulfillment centers,\" just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May 2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including 37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe:<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image1.jpg\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image1.jpg</url><br/> Of course, it's unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the company handles customer service at separate locations, something a retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only a small fraction of TJX's business). Add in those locations, plus the newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100 retail operations centers globally.<br/> If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon's sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about\u00a080 times\u00a0the sales per location of a TJX.<br/> In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and FedEx[5] will service them\u2014no need for high-rent districts with lots of shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and the same). Amazon's negotiation power and economies of scale are both significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront retailer.<br/>Employment<br/>Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes, but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business. But here too, Amazon's differences are broadly apparent.<br/>TJX Companies Inc. has approximately 179,000 employees: as with any retailer, it's a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers.<br/>Amazon's demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn't specify how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being 30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number of them would not be full-time, year-round positions.<br/> (Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts and on short notice\u2014a more difficult task for traditional storefront retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight to 6 a.m. doesn't help move any more product. So it's reasonable to assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most other retailers.)<br/> In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX's workforce. To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about\u00a0five times more efficient\u00a0than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer.<br/>Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail location\u2014especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400\u2014and many other aspects of the business share this limitation.<br/>Stacking Up Against Retail's Big Boys<br/>TJX wasn't cherry-picked as a counterexample\u2014there are many retailers with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don't put a dent in the revenue-per-employee figure:<br/><br/>[6][7] [8] [9][10]<br/> [11]<br/><br/>As is obvious above, Amazon's revenue per employee is leaps and bounds above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues from its insurance programs, so it's partially miscategorized. Even so, it still doesn't come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency; CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a single staffer in order to catch up.<br/>Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close.<br/>Amazon's revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard. And it's one of the reasons that despite a long track record of underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the market's good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is\u2014a technology company with leverage that can grow revenues in a big way\u2014and not a more traditional retailer.<br/> But this also means that for every jar of\u00a0Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty[12]\u00a0that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target\u2026 or one-fifth that of TJX.<br/>What Does This Mean for the President's Jobs Plan?<br/>Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are choked and bridges are crumbling.<br/> At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That's the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday's commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio.<br/> And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon \"creates,\" four other jobs go away at a company like TJX.<br/> But it's not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each other\u2014an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book\u00a0The Innovator's Dilemma[13]\u00a0(available at Amazon.com[14], of course) that at one point the commonplace hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn't\u2014and still can't\u2014dig nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn't matter. They won the overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value of their improvements.<br/> Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon's relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its\u00a0INefficiency. For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different trucks.<br/>TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly inefficient.<br/> What Amazon doesn't spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous.<br/> In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this graph of Amazon's gross revenue and its profits for the past five years\u2026<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image2.jpg\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image2.jpg</url><br/> You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits. The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be it through FedEx[15] drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities\u2014from building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all that money.<br/> Even\u00a0if\u00a0the company was profitable, the same would be true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending.<br/> Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going to reduce employment in the affected industry. That's the breaks. But it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever.<br/> A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation, aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant and serious dent in the demand for labor\u2014we've already seen it with low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors.<br/> Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers\u2014services contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and you'll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental, through technology.<br/> The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate, or which otherwise impede the flow of capital\u2014i.e., those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners.<br/> Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth.<br/> If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues, they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value of our money and security of our savings.<br/> Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other employment opportunities will fill the gaps created.<br/> Plus, it's not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all, Costco[16]\u2014the star quarterback of the big-box store movement\u2014generates over $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could still learn a few things.<br/> As for the question of whether more efficient companies\u2014which employ software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly every year) to save on labor\u2014destroy more jobs than they create\u2026 it's not as simple as it might seem at first. Innovation ultimately benefits society, so we must be careful not to hamper it for fear of the unknown future it will bring.<br/> While technology jobs pose a conundrum for politicians, companies like Amazon will continue to grow their market share and make handsome profits for investors.

That's because this distribution center, opening its doors with a burst of fanfare and even a few visits from nearby politicians, isn't a jumping-off point for Macy's or Target. Instead, the warehouse is the latest in a series of new locations being opened by retail technology giant Amazon.com.</p><p><br/> The jobs this new mega-warehouse is purported to create: 5,000.<br/> The politicians who made the quick trip to Tennessee to get in front of the cameras included one President Barack Obama, who gave a rousing speech not just about the importance of the 5,000 jobs promised at this one facility (and another 2,000 corollary positions at customer service centers elsewhere in the country), but also about the \"need\" to raise taxes on the businesses that are creating them and use those taxes to fund \"infrastructure\" jobs in green energy and natural gas, among other areas.<br/>The politically charged speech and the press conference from Amazon.com touting its job-creation abilities have understandably drawn quite the skeptical reaction from some. But surprisingly, in all the talk I've heard in the media these past few days, most of the fury seems directed not at the proposed tax hikes, but at Amazon itself for creating what might be fewer jobs than it claims \u2026 and possibly for destroying more jobs than it creates.<br/> Along with its jobs announcement, Amazon's PR department was ready for the utterly predictable media criticism that the jobs are nothing more than menial, low-wage shop floor jobs. Its retort? These new jobs will pay on average 30% higher than typical retail jobs. That's a good thing for the employed, no doubt, to be paid more for a similar skill-level job.<br/><br/>But with its emphasis on low prices, how can Amazon afford to boost those wages so much? It all boils down to efficiency. Think about Amazon versus another retailing giant without the same level of sales, but with a similar \"low prices\" kind of push: TJX companies (owners of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods). Last year, Amazon had retail sales of over $60 billion globally (up from $47 billion in 2011); TJX brought in about half that, at almost $26 billion globally (up from $23 billion in 2011). Whatever the companies' similarities, the differences between the two couldn't be bigger; and those differences have profound impacts for investors, as well as for the future of our economy.<br/> On one hand, you have companies like TJX\u2014so-called \"bricks and mortar\" retailers\u2014which in order to do business every day must staff a few thousand stores, and keep them open for 10, 12, or even 24 hours per day. That means greeters, checkers, security, customer service, and stockroom employees, plus bright lighting, catchy displays, and other ordinary features of a quality retail facility.<br/> Companies like Amazon have bricks and mortar too, of course, as displayed on the recent junket in Tennessee. But that's about all they have. Amazon can operate in facilities far off the beaten path, with nothing but wire shelves and cement floors, and they can serve just as many customers from only a fraction of the locations\u2014and a fraction of the manpower\u2014that their competitors require. On just about every front, the company is more efficient than its peers. But let's look specifically at two of the top expenses for virtually any retail company: its plant and its people. Facilities Last year, TJX ended with 3,055 stores, making it one of the most prolific clothing and home goods retailers in the US. It pegs its sales at a respectable $8.5 million annually per store. That's not a big-box retailer like Best Buy, which racked up $25 million per store in 2011, but it's solid compared to many other clothing and home goods retailers (like Sears, with much larger stores and only $9.5 million in per location sales, or the Gap, with smaller, mall-style stores and only $5 million per outlet).<br/>Amazon doesn't have stores, of course. It has \"fulfillment centers,\" just like the new one in Tennessee that the POTUS visited. As of May 2013, a few dozen such centers are scattered across the world, including 37 in the US and 2 in Canada, and another dozen plus in Europe:<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image1.jpg\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image1.jpg</url><br/> Of course, it's unfair to count only fulfillment centers, as the company handles customer service at separate locations, something a retailer like TJX would normally handle mostly onsite in the stores (excepting the separate online sales division, but that constitutes only a small fraction of TJX's business). Add in those locations, plus the newest centers Amazon plans to open, and you still have fewer than 100 retail operations centers globally.<br/> If we round up just to be fair, that pegs Amazon's sales per location for the past year at $660 million, or about 80 times the sales per location of a TJX.<br/> In addition to the amount of dollars per square foot in revenue that Amazon can push out its doors, the company can strike deals to grab land in otherwise desolate areas for its facilities, so long as UPS and FedEx will service them\u2014no need for high-rent districts with lots of shopper traffic. This means that not only does the company have to support fewer square feet of space and make each square foot less glamorous, it can also push into districts willing to offer it big tax savings, or where construction costs are highly depressed (often one and the same). Amazon's negotiation power and economies of scale are both significantly higher than the average multi-thousand storefront retailer.<br/>Employment Of course, having more sales per location means less if you have to fill that location with just as many people to get the goods out the door. Sure, you save on the overhead from electricity to property taxes, but you can only gain so much efficiency in a labor-intensive business. But here too, Amazon's differences are broadly apparent. TJX Companies Inc. has approximately 179,000 employees: as with any retailer, it's a mix of full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers.<br/>Amazon's demand is just as cyclical as any other retailer. When queried at the press conference in Tennessee, a company rep wouldn't specify how many of the 5,000 promised new jobs are part-time and seasonal. He instead jumped back to the pre-approved talking point about pay being 30% higher on average. The spokesman did acknowledge that a good number of them would not be full-time, year-round positions.<br/> (Amazon is able to staff much more efficiently than most retailers during non-holiday seasons, thanks to real-time, around-the-clock operations management and the ability to pull staff in for extra shifts and on short notice\u2014a more difficult task for traditional storefront retailers, because having 10 extra people show up tomorrow from midnight to 6 a.m. doesn't help move any more product. So it's reasonable to assume Amazon will have more seasonal help as a percentage than most other retailers.)<br/> In all, though, Amazon has managed to grow to its current level with just about 89,000 employees, or almost exactly half of TJX's workforce. To do that yet pull down 150% more revenue makes Amazon about five times more efficient than TJX, measured by retail sales per staffer.<br/>Amazon is able to do so because the number of shoppers who can be served per warehouse employee is much higher than at a typical retail location\u2014especially the smaller stores that TJX mostly uses. The same goes for all the servers the company operates: one IT guy can take the midnight shift and keep a few thousand servers up and running, but one janitor cannot clean the floors at two locations, let alone 400\u2014and many other aspects of the business share this limitation.<br/> Stacking Up Against Retail's Big Boys TJX wasn't cherry-picked as a counterexample\u2014there are many retailers with far worse operating margins than TJX to pick on if that was the goal. Amazon stands out head and shoulders above nearly all other retailers in efficiency. Even when stacked up against larger competitors which can bring more scale to the business than TJX can, such as retail megastore Walmart, whose $470 billion in sales don't put a dent in the revenue-per-employee figure:<br/><br/><br/><br/> As is obvious above, Amazon's revenue per employee is leaps and bounds above its competition. The only other one on our short list that comes close is CVS, but despite the public perception of the company as a retailer, it now generates the overwhelming majority of its revenues from its insurance programs, so it's partially miscategorized. Even so, it still doesn't come close to Amazon in terms of revenue efficiency; CVS would need to grow its sales by greater than 50% without adding a single staffer in order to catch up.<br/>Walmart? It would have to lay off over two-thirds of its employees or triple its same-store sales to even come close.<br/>Amazon's revenue efficiency is remarkable by virtually any standard. And it's one of the reasons that despite a long track record of underperforming on earnings, the company has generally stayed in the market's good graces and been granted a hefty valuation relative to its peers. The market sees Amazon for what it is\u2014a technology company with leverage that can grow revenues in a big way\u2014and not a more traditional retailer.<br/> But this also means that for every jar of Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty[2] that is shipped out the door, the number of people on the payroll is only one-fourth that of Walmart or Target \u2026 or one-fifth that of TJX.<br/> What Does This Mean for the President's Jobs Plan? Does this mean that Barack Obama is right? Does the government need to step in, tax these efficient companies harder, and spend that money on solar farms, wind turbines, and transport infrastructure? After all, you cannot efficiently deliver tens of millions of packages when roads are choked and bridges are crumbling. At first glance, it would be easy to jump to that conclusion. That's the direction I heard quite a few of Tuesday and Wednesday's commentators heading with their questions, even on business-oriented stations like my morning commute companion, Bloomberg Radio.<br/>And yes, in some senses, for every job Amazon \"creates,\" four other jobs go away at a company like TJX.<br/> But it's not that simple. First, with any efficiency comes inefficiency on another point. The relative competitiveness of two business models is driven by the economic weight of those items in contrast to each other\u2014an equation that changes over time. For instance, Clayton Christensen eloquently pointed out years ago in his book The Innovator's Dilemma[3] (available at Amazon.com, of course) that at one point the commonplace hydraulic backhoes and diggers that litter every construction site in the modern world were once considered vastly inferior to their cable-actuated big brothers. Per foot, they couldn't\u2014and still can't\u2014dig nearly as wide a moat per pass. But it didn't matter. They won the overall market on convenient smaller sizes, easier maintenance, and better safety. Their inefficiencies were simply smaller than the value of their improvements.<br/> Much the same, while you can argue about Amazon's relative efficiency to TJX, you must be careful not to discount its INefficiency. For instance, at a store like TJMaxx, one truckload of goods can restock the place for weeks. To deliver the orders of a few dozen Amazon customers might require dozens of individual packages, shipped to half a dozen different sort facilities, and put on a few dozen different trucks.<br/>TJX benefits from all the dinosaur dung burned by its customers coming to the store and driving goods back home for it. Amazon, on the other hand, takes those nearly countless millions of extra miles and absorbs them into its business model. Compared in this way, Amazon is incredibly inefficient.<br/> What Amazon doesn't spend hiring direct employees, the company outsources to others, and the sum of those expenses is enormous.<br/> In fact, the company is so good at spending that gross margin per staffer, that it usually manages to spend it all. Just look at this graph of Amazon's gross revenue and its profits for the past five years\u2026<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image2.jpg\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/130801image2.jpg</url><br/> You might have to squint to find the red bars that represent profits. The difference between those two sets of colored bars is the amount Amazon spends on not just its 89,000 employees, but all of its operations and marketing. All of those dollars flow into the economy, be it through FedEx drivers and pilots, outsourced programmers, content licensing agreements, purchases of inventory to keep its unimaginable selection of goods growing, or any of hundreds of other paths. And each path is itself a series of jobs generated and a series of taxes that eventually do flow to the government to fund all of its activities\u2014from building fences to keep out Mexicans to staffing the IRS to collect all that money. Even if the company was profitable, the same would be true. Those people who made more money would be inclined to invest and spend it. The higher the relative profitability, the more free cash flow, and the more likely it is to turn into additional spending.<br/> Any company whose technology improves efficiency in these ways is going to reduce employment in the affected industry. That's the breaks. But it does not necessarily mean those jobs are gone forever.<br/>A time will come when the amount of efficiency gained by automation, aggregation, logistics, and other techniques puts another significant and serious dent in the demand for labor\u2014we've already seen it with low-skill manufacturing jobs, and we are seeing it take hold now in retail sales. But that does not have to mean the end of the economy or an economy of no jobs. Instead, the efficiency flows outward to create new opportunities surrounding the new business and its investors.<br/> Revenue efficiency creates demand for business services. What is not done in house gets pushed to other networks of suppliers\u2014services contracted by the sellers or by the buyers. Also, profit efficiency creates income for investors, which gets reinvested into more new businesses. Just look to the Silicon Valley venture-capital scene, and you'll see years of investment gains flowing back into the markets to the tune of multiple billions of dollars per year in investments into companies bent on reinventing every area of the economy, from entertainment to building supplies to biotechnology to car rental, through technology.<br/> The biggest risk to our economy and employment is not innovation, which speeds up the flow of capital. Rather, the risks to be on the lookout for are the ones that compromise the ability of businesses to innovate, or which otherwise impede the flow of capital\u2014i.e., those that restrict lending, cause people or companies to hoard cash, or generate fear and distrust among trading partners.<br/> Fears over banking failures in 2008 showed just how serious this risk can be. And while the short-term reaction of shoring up liquidity in financial markets may look to have been a smart one in retrospect, the long-term lack of consequences for outright criminal activity in that sector are damning for the future of the economy. Trust in our government, bankers, and currency continues to be at all-time lows, a factor that can only be slowing the return of economic growth.<br/> If Barack Obama and camp want to generate more government revenues, they should consider backing off on the new taxes and focus instead on limiting the regulations that impede the flow of capital. They should help secure confidence in the economy, not just through buoying up the stock markets, but through justice and prudent oversight over the value of our money and security of our savings.<br/> Companies like Amazon thankfully continue to invest and grow despite the rising tide of operational regulations (for all the deregulation in banking over the past 20 years, the same cannot be said of any other sector) and the continued political immunity of the banking class. As it does so, its innovations are making life better for the majority of people. While the industry-wide shift of employment will be painful to some, over time the economy will adjust, as it always has, and other employment opportunities will fill the gaps created.<br/> Plus, it's not like Amazon has a lock on retail efficiency. After all, Costco\u2014the star quarterback of the big-box store movement\u2014generates over $975,000 in sales per employee. Yes, it seems like even Amazon could still learn a few things.<br/> As for the question of whether more efficient companies\u2014which employ software and even robots (as Amazon does in its warehouses increasingly every year) to save on labor\u2014destroy more jobs than they create\u2026 it's not as simple as it might seem at first. Innovation ultimately benefits society, so we must be careful not to hamper it for fear of the unknown future it will bring.<br/>While technology jobs pose a conundrum for politicians, companies like Amazon will continue to grow their market share and make handsome profits for investors.

The jump puts Amazon's lobbying efforts in the same league as other tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 and reflects how the company's expanding business interests have raised the stakes of its relationship with the government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">------------</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The issues were wide-ranging from some obvious ones such as online sales taxes and drones. But it also pressed Washington on other matters including computer cloud services, cybersecurity and welfare benefits.</p><p> ------------</p><p> The increased lobbying spending is just one sign of Amazon's interest in courting the nation's capital. In the fall of 2014, the company moved its Washington policy shop to a much larger office space. Last spring, Amazon picked up Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"Like a lot of businesses, Amazon has a presence in Washington and we focus on issues that matter to us,\" said Carney, now Amazon senior vice president for global corporate affairs.</p><p> ------------</p><p>Amazon has long lobbied for the creation of a national standard for collecting state sales tax for online purchases, a change that would simplify their business practices.</p><p> ------------</p><p> In a recent town hall meeting with Washington Post employees, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos \u2014 who also owns The Post \u2014 cited state sales taxes as the lobbying issue he has been personally most engaged on. But so far, legislation at the heart of that change has been unsuccessful \u2014 much to Bezos' chagrin.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"It's even a bipartisan issue that both side agree on and we still can't get it done,\" he said. \"It's very puzzling to me as an outsider, I don't know how you guys live here, honestly.\"</p><p> ------------</p><p> But Amazon's fastest growing sector, Amazon Web Services, is far from an outsider in Washington. While most people probably know Amazon as an online retailer, its cloud computing segment is fast becoming a key pillar of its business. The subsidiary \u2014 which lets customers use Amazon's Web-based servers for their computing needs \u2014 has deals with big tech firms such as Netflix and Airbnb, as well as some parts of the federal government.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"They are the primary cloud infrastructure provider to government,\" said Lydia Leong, a distinguished analyst and vice president focused on information technologies at research firm Gartner.</p><p> ------------</p><p> The company's cloud segment has done business with an alphabet soup of agencies including NASA, HHS, and DOJ. Even then, the full scope of Amazon's business relationship with the government is hard to track because there are more than a dozen resellers that agencies can also use to purchase its services. But one government agreement stands out: In 2013, Amazon was awarded a contract worth up to $600 million by the CIA to build and maintain a cloud system for America's intelligence agencies \u2014 over the objections of IBM, which had offered to do the job for a lower price.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"The fact that AWS has had some success in its business with the public sector, and obviously with the CIA, speaks to the quality of what AWS has and offers,\" said Carney.</p><p> ------------</p><p> It's unclear how significant government contracting is to AWS's overall growth: The cloud services division had 70 percent year on year sales growth for a total operating income of $1.86 billion in 2015, according to the company's latest SEC filing. The cloud segment also has much thicker margins than other parts of the business, and could soon eclipse profits from North American retail operations if it keeps growing at the same rate.</p><p> ------------</p><p> But the recent SEC filing did warn that the company faces risks related to \"government contracts and related procurement regulations.\" And last year, the company also retained the lobbying services of Richard Beutel, who previously served a senior staffer for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and was the original author of the last major law reforming federal IT policy. Beutel left the government in January of 2015. By April, his new firm was registered to lobbying on behalf of Amazon Web Services \u2014 engaging \"with policymakers regarding cloud acquisition and deployment,\" according to one disclosure.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Bringing in people who have deep ties to the government contracting process like Beutel shows that Amazon's efforts to woo the government are maturing. But Leong said they're still playing catch up with their major competition in the cloud IT space, Microsoft, who has a longer history in government contracting.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"They do not have as many relationships \u2014 and we know that government contracting involves a lot of relationships. Microsoft, for instance, has very deep relationships on the federal and state level \u2014 they understand how this works,\" said Leong. \"Amazon is really having to learn how to navigate all these things,\" she said.</p><p> ------------</p><p> The lobbying disclosures do not break down how much Amazon spent on each of the issues listed on the forms. And the company did not elaborate on which issues primarily drove the increase. But on some matters, such as drones, Amazon has made its interests clear.</p><p> ------------</p><p>Amazon dreams of delivering packages to customers doorsteps via unmanned aircraft, even though the proposed rules by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial drone use wouldn't allow for the type of flights the company hopes to make.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"The FAA has a tough job \u2014 so I think we can acknowledge that right away,\" Bezos said when asked about his experience working with the agency at the town hall. \"What's happening with drones is going to cause a lot of new rules to be written, and they're going to have to be done very carefully.\"</p><p> ------------</p><p> While Bezos said the agency has \"very good intentions,\" he also argued their approach perhaps may be a little \"backward.\"</p><p> ------------</p><p> The FAA is \"a little strangely hamstrung because they have very little control over hobbyist drones and complete control over commercial drones,\" Bezos said. A company like Amazon, he argued, can bring a higher \"level of care and rigor\" to its drone projects than most hobbyists.</p><p> ------------</p><p> The FAA has been slower than some of the other jurisdictions where Amazon is also experimenting, Bezos said, citing \"forward thinking\" approaches in Canada, the U.K. and the Netherlands.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \"There are a number of jurisdictions where I suspect we'll see parcel delivery by drone first,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYHLD-2719524db9837b44f5aad8b2d9e48da5722036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYHLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1T-VW11-F0NV-F0S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Daily Herald, Everett, WA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Herald (Everett, Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 5, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

(ticker: <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) reported second-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating revenue but whiffing on earnings per share (EPS) estimates.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-03-28/amazon-com-inc-amzn-stock\">AMZN stock</url> slipped in after-hours trading, falling 2.5%. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The iconic online shopping giant posted EPS of $5.22, lower than the $5.57 per share analysts expected. Revenue clocked in at $63.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Wall Street expected revenue of $62.48 billion in the quarter. </p><p>Heading into the release, the e-commerce leader was one of the top mega-cap tech performers of 2019. At the close of trading on Thursday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/bargain-buys-on-amazon-outlet\">Amazon</url> shares were up 33% year-to-date, bringing its market cap to $992 billion and making it the second-most valuable company on Earth. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AWS surges, but misses expectations.</emphasis>Revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS) came in at $8.38 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Although that's fantastic growth, it failed to match consensus expectations of $8.48 billion in revenue, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. </p><p>AWS is a heavily scrutinized key component of Amazon's business -- not merely because it's growing faster than the retail side, but because the cloud computing segment enjoys high margins. Those profits allow Amazon to finance other low-margin or money-losing endeavors and provide a level of service that most rivals can't compete with. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">10 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2019.</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One-day shipping.</emphasis>Amazon's retail prowess alone was enough to make AMZN stock an elite performer for many years, but the dual purpose of AWS -- profit engine and method for funding long-term competitive advantages -- has allowed the company to separate itself from the pack. </p><p>The company's obsessive focus on customer service is one way Amazon chooses to spend that extra dough. In June, it announced free one-day shipping for Prime members on more than 10 million products. </p><p>\"Consumers stand to benefit from Amazon doubling down on e-commerce initiatives including one-day shipping for Prime members and over $800 million in second quarter investment in delivery infrastructure,\" says Madhan Kanagavel, CEO and Founder at FileCloud, an Austin, Texas-headquartered enterprise file sharing company. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prime Day results.</emphasis>Lightning-fast delivery is just one way <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/fast-growing-brands-for-long-term-investors\">AMZN</url> is trying to grow the number of Amazon Prime members; the company's annual sales holiday, Prime Day, is another key method.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/articles/prime-day-alternatives-best-other-sales-to-shop\">Prime Day</url> (which now lasts two days), occurred on July 15 and 16, and the Q2 earnings report revealed that it was \"the largest shopping event in Amazon history.\" </p><p>More importantly, sales during that two-day promotion surpassed combined sales of both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And arguably most important, Amazon added more Prime memberships than any other two-day period in company history. </p><p>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-cheap-stocks-to-buy-under-10/\">10 of the Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10.</url>]</p><p>Though vague, these are good facts to know for investors; the promotion fell outside of Amazon's second quarter, so <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-prime-day\">Prime Day</url> will be reflected when Q3 AMZN earnings roll around. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antitrust concerns.</emphasis>The Trump administration is starting to clamp down on big tech, with the U.S. government announcing that it's looking into whether major technology firms are illegally crushing competitors. Facebook ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>) was just forced to pay a record $5 billion fine to the Federal Trade Commission in relation to privacy violations. And Amazon could end up in the crosshairs itself before very long. </p><p>\"The biggest potential valuation factor for Amazon moving forward is increased regulatory scrutiny and increased regulatory risk,\" says Robert Johnson, finance professor at Creighton University's Heider College of Business. \"Treasury Secretary (Steven) Mnuchin's comments that Amazon has 'limited competition' and has 'destroyed the retail industry across the United States' signals that the firm will come under increased regulatory scrutiny in the future.\" </p><p>This is the flip side of <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/7-tech-stocks-that-are-helping-us-live-longer\">Amazon's</url> wild success and customer obsession over the years -- once you reach a $1 trillion valuation, regulators start suspecting you might have some sort of unfair advantage. </p><p>For now though, the Q2 earnings miss isn't a game-changer for shareholders, and the company is chugging along as it should. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, Amazon stock fell 2.5% after the company reported second-quarter earnings., (Paul Sakuma, File/AP)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USNCOM-190725investing.amznq2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP1-SS81-F02J-81X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 U.S. News &amp;

(NASDAQ:AMZN) and SpaceX are leading the race to get into space. </p><p>This is in a bid to provide internet to some of the remotest places on earth. This 21st-century space race involves thousands of satellites.Satellite internet for remote areasA couple of tech companies have requested permission from US regulators to run satellite constellations[1] to offer internet. However, not all companies are focusing on connecting consumers, as some have huge global ambitions. For Amazon, according to their CEO Jeff Bezos, the goal is to get broadband everywhere. Almost half of the world's population is not connected to the internet, and this is a massive potential. Getting internet to people in remote areas[2] will be beneficial to the people in many ways. For instance, the lacks of the internet make it hard for people in remote areas to access healthcare as well as make job applications. This cuts this population from the taking part in growing the economy. However, the new race for space powered internet faces a myriad of challenges. For starters, it is costly to launch and complex technology-wise which could prove to be expensive for the people it is supposed to help.More companies in the raceCurrently, companies such as HughesNet and ViaSat Inc. (NASDAQ: VSAT) dominate satellite internet segment. However, the service these satellites offer is costly and limited, and it comes with lags and data caps. The entry of Amazon and SpaceX in the domain could change the space. Other companies in the race include OneWeb backed by Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson[3], Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Softbank Group (OTCMKTS: SFTBY) a Japanese conglomerate. This is an industry that is still growing and still some years away from mainstream commercial adoption. It is an industry that will be profitable in the next decade. However, these companies will need to develop antennas and dishes that are expensive and complicated relative top traditional dishes. For instance, SpaceX has sought permission to build earth stations to help in connecting users to the internet.

For many, it was not a cause for celebration: it was further evidence of the threat posed by the $863bn ((EURO)769bn) behemoth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that same \"Cyber Monday\", warehouse workers in San Bernardino, California, picketed for better conditions, where serious injuries run at four times the rate of the national average. In Brussels, regulators from the European Commission joined politicians for a firstof-its-kind \"Amazon symposium\", where union leaders called for its break-up.</p><p>The protests were more than the scattered cries of a few angry people. They represent something deeper: a sharp, fundamental shift in sentiment against the company. It is still loved by consumers, perhaps more than ever, but regulators and politicians have turned against Amazon like never before. And if a Democrat wins America's election next year - Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been vociferous critics - Amazon could face the fight of its life against a government intent on breaking it up.</p><p>Louis Hyman, economic historian at Cornell University in New York State, said: \"There's always one company that becomes the evil face of despotic capital. That's Amazon. There's this sense of its inevitable dominance of everything.\"</p><p>The question is whether Amazon is any different from Standard Oil, Walmart or the A&amp;P Tea company, which dominated US retail from the 1920s to the 1970s.</p><p>Jon Nordmark, founder of consultancy Iterate.ai, said Jeff Bezos's empire was different. In the past 12 months, he said, Amazon ploughed nearly $30bn into R&amp;D - twice as much as Apple, and almost triple Facebook's outlay. That investment has gobbled up nearly all its $28bn in earnings before interest and expenses.</p><p>The upshot is that Amazon pays little to no tax. Fair Tax Mark, an independent NGO, labelled it last week as the worst offender in Big Tech, claiming it had paid only $3.4bn in taxes in the past decade. That equates to just 12% of its already whittled-down profits. Nordmark said: \"They're using that $30bn basically to bankrupt all the people that don't do R&amp;D spending and pay their taxes.\"</p><p>To be clear, such tax breaks are designed to incentivise exactly what Amazon is doing - ploughing cash into new products. It is simply doing it on a scale that none of its rivals touches. And given the breadth of Bezos's ambition, there is no reason to think this will ever change. What the billionaire has built is less a company than an astonishing ecosystem, gathering data from one corner of your life to offer you services in another.</p><p>Amazon is the biggest provider of cloud computing services. It runs an airline, a film studio, operates 400 grocery stores and employs more than 500,000 warehouse workers. Last week it started to stream Premier League matches and it launched a medical transcription service that records and files conversations with your doctor as part of its assault on the $3 trillion healthcare market. The company has installed tens of millions of listening devices and surveillance cameras into people's homes, and has hundreds of partnerships with police departments for access to home video footage.</p><p>Amazon employs some 7,000 artificial intelligence researchers. It is the business equivalent of the Manhattan Project.</p><p>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that ahead of the presidential election, where the hollowing out of the middle class - and middle-class jobs - is a central issue, Amazon has become the bogeyman.</p><p>Hyman pointed to a 2017 JP Morgan study that found 30% of US middle-class families saw their monthly income fluctuate by up to 30%. In the bottom fifth, that proportion rose to 75%. \"Just imagine the anxiety when your income goes up or down by 30% every month. Amazon is not what's wrong in society. It's not why income is unequal or pay-cheques are volatile. That all existed before the rise of Amazon as a major force in retail.\"</p><p>But Amazon, with its army of warehouse robots and relentless quest for more automation, has become the totem of iniquities of the modern economy. Its undoing could be the breakneck expansion of its logistics business: its warehouses, contract delivery drivers and pilots that ensure your packages arrive swiftly and safely. In the past three years, its workforce has nearly tripled from 230,000 to 650,000 as Bezos has cut out third-party suppliers and built a fulfilment colossus.</p><p>David Michaels, who, until 2017, ran America's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the government body that polices workplace safety, saw a sharp rise in violations at Amazon warehouses, where workers often stand in one spot to stack products onto an endless parade of robots. He said: \"If the robot controls your speed, and if you could lose your job if you don't keep up, you will do everything to keep up.\"</p><p>The GMB union says ambulances were called to Amazon's warehouse in Rugeley, Staffordshire, 115 times in the past three years. Over the same period, a nearby Tesco warehouse made just eight calls. In America, it was found contract drivers, under pressure to deliver parcels, had been involved in a rash of accidents, some of them fatal.</p><p>Amazon could face a new threat: that people will stop and think about the unseen costs of having whatever they desire turn up on their doorstep in 24 hours. That could prove to be a powerful weapon for those wishing to bring it down. Nordmark said: \"Amazon is attacking Fedex. Disney. Walmart. Advertising companies. Warehouse companies. They have a lot of enemies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon, run by Jeff Bezos, is being seen as a bogeymanERIC BARADAT</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155479431</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP4-SSM1-DYTY-C037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CORNELL UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Keith Ellison (D-Minn)[4], who has 'concerns about the amount of money Amazon has made from the sale of literature and music published by entities identified as 'hate groups' by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).' Ellison seeks Amazon's sales data, specifically Kindle Direct Publishing[5] and CreateSpace[6], of 'SPLC-identified hate groups.' A business has no legal duty to provide sales data to a U.S. Congressman. For ill-informed liberals: The United States' economic system is capitalism, not socialism: a government-owned or controlled company. </p><p>If I received Ellison's letter, I would shred it and mail it back to him! SPLC's opinion of 'hate' The liberal Southern Poverty Law Center[7] attempts to define hate[8] for its HateWatch[9], Hate Map[10], and How Tech Supports Hate[11]. Also, in its Extremist Files[12], the SPLC profiles persons and groups in an attempt to delegitimize opposing views, particularly of conservatives who adhere to the traditional Judeo-Christian heritage, and critics of Islam. As reported by PJMedia[13]: 'In the words of SPLC former spokesman Mark Potok (who spent 20 years as a senior fellow at the SPLC and only retired this year [2017], according to LinkedIn[14]), the group does not exist to monitor hate groups. 'Sometimes the press will describe us as monitoring hate groups, I want to say plainly that our aim in life is to destroy these groups, completely destroy them,' Potok declared[15] at an event in Michigan in 2007.' The Southern Poverty Law Center in a settlement paid more than $3 million, and apologized[16], to the Quilliam Foundation and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, as reported by Fox News[17]. Also, the SPLC apologized[18] to other journalists, as reported by Fox News[19]. The Southern Poverty Law Center, and media which rely on the SPLC, are exposed to liability, according to a joint statement[20] by conservative persons and organizations, as reported by PJMedia here[21] and here[22]. 'Liberty Counsel filed a lawsuit[23] against the charity navigation organization GuideStar for defamation after GuideStar adopted the SPLC's 'hate group' list. That lawsuit is ongoing.' How does Amazon define hate? Amazon describes prohibition of 'Offensive and Controversial Material[24],' but arguably out-sources the controversial AmazonSmile[25] program, according to World News Daily[26]: 'When [Religious Freedom Coalition[27]] questioned Amazon about the decision [to exclude RFC], a lawyer, Ambika Kumar Doran, said there would be no explanation coming. 'Amazon relies on the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control [28]and the Southern Poverty Law Center to determine which registered charities fall into these groups,' the lawyer wrote.' Amazon, a publicly traded[29] company, reports to its shareholders, and may establish its policies and procedures, and terms of service. Amazon allegedly delivers hate, but how? 'Delivering Hate[30] [et al],' a report jointly written by two organizations: the Partnership for Working Families[31], and Acre Action Center on Race ...e Economy[32], cites two examples of groups which criticize Islam: Allegation: According to the report [p. 11]: 'Chick Publications, long identified as a hate group due to its 'militant, vitriolic propaganda war against anyone who doesn't adhere to its particular brand of Christianity.'' Rebuttal: Chick Publications[33] is known for its Christian tracts[34], including comics, since it's a format for easy understanding of the Gospel. Christians love everyone, and therefore address spiritual issues including criticism of Islam. This article's author has used these tracts for distribution including Halloween, school, and elsewhere. Allegation: According to the report [p. 15]: 'Among the content Amazon is helping to deliver via CloudFront is the website of Act for America, which the SPLC and The ADL identify as the largest anti-Muslim hate group in the United States.' Rebuttal: Act for America[35]'s mission[36]: 'is focused on educating, engaging, and mobilizing citizens and elected officials to impact legislative outcomes to keep America safe and secure. Through training and education ACT for America is empowering citizens to help prevent criminal activity and terrorism while preserving civil liberties protected by the US constitution.' Its founder, Brigitte Gabriel[37], 'is one of the leading terrorism experts in the world providing information and analysis on the rise of global Islamic terrorism.' Prosyletization and criticism are activities of all religions, including secular humanism[38]. The phrase, 'militant, vitriolic propaganda war against anyone who doesn't adhere' describes Islam's core doctrine[39]: Muhammad used the sword to 'persuade:' (a) convert to Islam; or (b) become a second-class citizen and pay Jiyza[40], a tax; or (c) die. Progressive groups' 'militant, vitriolic propaganda war' of liberalism is used 'against anyone who doesn't adhere to its particular brand of' liberalism. That describes the Southern Poverty Law Center and its useful idiots: any business, media or group which relies on SPLC's unscientific, opinion-driven, defamatory list of hate. The marketplace to determine neutrality or fair dealing The marketplace - voting with your wallet - should be the means to influence how an industry establishes policies, procedures, and self-regulation. However, when a business reaches a dominant market share, combined with its proprietary technology and substantial funds, there may be less incentive for neutrality or fair dealing. According to the American Conservative[41]: 'Google controls nearly 90 percent of search advertising, Facebook almost 80 percent of mobile social traffic, and Amazon about 75 percent of e-book sales. This spectacular success has created unprecedented wealth and established U.S. leadership in the technologies of the future. But recent misuse of their platforms to influence the 2016 U.S. elections and broader concerns over data privacy, control, and revenue sharing have led some to take a more critical view of these big tech companies.' 'Social media censorship and online restriction of conservatives and their organizations have reached a crisis level,' reports MRC Newsbusters[42]. 'Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's hearings on Capitol Hill only served to draw attention to how widespread this problem has become. Conservative leaders now have banded together to call for equal treatment on tech and social media Here are four key areas that social media companies must address to begin to rectify their credibility problem: 1) Provide Transparency: We need detailed information so everyone can see if liberal groups and users are being treated the same as those on the right. Social media companies operate in a black-box environment, only releasing anecdotes about reports on content and users when they think it necessary. This needs to change. The companies need to design open systems so that they can be held accountable, while giving weight to privacy concerns. 2) Provide Clarity on 'Hate Speech': 'Hate speech' is a common concern among social media companies, but no two firms define it the same way. Their definitions are vague and open to interpretation, and their interpretation often looks like an opportunity to silence thought. Today, hate speech means anything liberals don't like. Silencing those you disagree with is dangerous. If companies can't tell users clearly what it is, then they shouldn't try to regulate it. 3) Provide Equal Footing for Conservatives: Top social media firms, such as Google and YouTube, have chosen to work with dishonest groups that are actively opposed to the conservative movement, including the Southern Poverty Law Center. Those companies need to make equal room for conservative groups as advisers to offset this bias. That same attitude should be applied to employment diversity efforts. Tech companies need to embrace viewpoint diversity. 4) Mirror the First Amendment: Tech giants should afford their users nothing less than the free speech and free exercise of religion embodied in the First Amendment as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. That standard, the result of centuries of American jurisprudence, would enable the rightful blocking of content that threatens violence or spews obscenity, without trampling on free speech liberties that have long made the United States a beacon for freedom.' Treat online retailers and social media as monopolies According to the American Conservative[43]: 'The historical success of antitrust enforcement poses an important lesson for conservatives. The question should not be whether a particular course of action is taken by government or the private sector, but whether that action achieves constitutionally acceptable goals while preserving or even enhancing individual liberty and opportunity.' Yet, 'Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple have all operated on the 'too big to regulate' principle,' argues The New Republic[44]. 'They built popular products, scaled up quickly, then dared governments to do something about their blatant violations of numerous laws or their opportunistic use of outdated regulations.' The U.S. Congress' current legislative session concerns: (a) Honest Ads Act[45]; (b) Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act[46]; (c) Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act[47]; and (d) the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act[48]. Sue the tech giants Internet service providers, and online platforms for retailing, claim immunity based on 230 of the Communications Decency Act[49]. The immunity was intended as a defense to a claim of tort - injury, defamation, etc. - allegedly due to content on a website. The ISPs and online platforms defend that they simply provide a platform for, but are not publishers (editors) of, a website's content. However, Internet Service Providers, and online platforms for retailing, via censorship and discrimination, essentially violate the spirit of free speech. By so doing, they are publishers and therefore should not have immunity. No surprise, lawyers use mental gymnastics to make claims and defenses. Litigation is expensive. The U.S. Attorney General is empowered to defend federal statutes. In the Obama administration, the Attorney General (Holder and Lynch) ignored federal law, such as the Defense of Marriage Act. In a lawsuit brought by the American Freedom Defense Initiative[50] et al, Attorney General Lynch claimed her office was not responsible to enforce the Communications Decency Act. The case was dismissed[51] for lack of standing. In-other-words, the Obama administration did not want a judicial opinion whether the Communications Decency Act unconstitutionally enabled violations of free speech. Instead, Plaintiff should directly sue social media, a more expensive endeavor. Faced with a threatened lawsuit by Geller, Facebook and other social media reinstated Geller's accounts. You go, girl! Notwithstanding the above-described hurdles, lawsuits have been brought by victims who allege social media was responsible in part for the Islamic terrorist attack at the Pulse night club. Dismissal[52] was the result of a federal case in Detroit, Michigan; while a related case will have a renewed motion to dismiss a second amended Complaint[53] (added plaintiffs) in Orlando, Florida. Amazon, Congressman Ellison, and Sharia Law Amazon may provide sales data for all transactions of 'SPLC-identified hate groups.' Whether intentional or inadvertent, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn)[54] may receive sales data of his critics, such as Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer, and other conservatives. If so, would Congressman Ellison have ethics to not read the data, and immediately return the data to Amazon? Ellison was the first Muslim elected[55] to the U.S. Congress. As reported by JihadWatch[56]: 'Ellison has spoken[57] at a convention of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Yet ISNA has actually admitted its ties to Hamas, which styles itself the Palestinian arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Justice Department actually classified ISNA among entities 'who are and/or were members of the US Muslim Brotherhood.'' 'It gets worse. In 2008, Ellison accepted $13,350 from the Muslim American Society (MAS) to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Muslim American Society is a Muslim Brotherhood organization: 'In recent years, the U.S. Brotherhood operated under the name Muslim American Society, according to documents and interviews. One of the nation's major Islamic groups, it was incorporated in Illinois in 1993 after a contentious debate among Brotherhood members.' That's from the Chicago Tribune in 2004[58], in an article that is now carried on the Muslim Brotherhood's English-language website, Ikhwanweb[59].' 'Also, the Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) raised large amounts of [funds (sic)] for Ellison's first campaign, and he has spoken at numerous CAIR events. Yet CAIR is an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas terror funding case[60] \u2014 so named by the Justice Department. CAIR officials have repeatedly refused[61] to[62] denounce[63] Hamas and Hizballah as terrorist groups.' If Amazon prohibits access, either as a vendor or the AmazonSmile program, by every person and group listed on SPLC's HateWatch, then the result effectively will be Sharia's blasphemy law[64]: the prohibition of criticism of Islam and Muhammad, a self-identified murderer, thief and pedophile.

According to sources said to be close to the matter, that follows an agreement apparently reached between the FTC and the other government agency responsible for providing oversight, the Department of Justice (DOJ). The agreement would see investigations into two of the nation's largest tech companies -- Amazon and Google -- split between the agencies. Similarities between the companies may have left Amazon open to deeper scrutiny News that Amazon and Google may be next to be placed under deeper scrutiny for its business practices comes following earlier reports[2] that had already suggested that the DOJ would be taking a closer look at the search giant. Google has been no stranger to these types of investigations over the past year or more due mostly to activities and policies that violate antitrust stringent regulations in Europe. </p><p>As a result of those being labeled anticompetitive in the EU, the company has been forced to alter its policies and taken other steps to change things voluntarily. That's in addition to paying hefty fines. Scrutiny in the US has been laxer but Amazon and Google have been just a couple of big tech companies that have come under fire from legislative bodies in the region, looking for answers about public and corporate practices. That has chiefly stemmed from just how much influence those companies -- a group that has included Facebook and Twitter, among others -- have in the public sphere. Given Google's history with regulatory bodies in the EU, it isn't surprising that it may now face a closer look into its dealings in the US. The company holds a significant grip over the mobile industry in addition to advertising, web browsing, search, and has key interests in areas of AI and autonomous vehicle technologies too. Amazon has similarly led the way in terms of technology investments and has a strong foothold in the retail space both online and off. Amazon[3] is also one of a few companies that are reportedly considering entering into the mobile market by purchasing Boost Mobile if and when that MVNO's parent company Sprint merges with T-Mobile. Amazon has had recent missteps in managing how it both stores and accesses user data pooled from its Alexa AI and associated devices. Namely, it was discovered to not only be storing recorded input but also had employees listening to select clips, presumably for quality control purposes. The company has since taken steps to allow end users to delete their stored data but the discovery leaves plenty of questions left to be answered. None of that is obviously or immediately indicative of a breach in antitrust laws. But the similarities between Amazon's mistakes and some of Google's may have left just enough questions about exactly how wide its reach is and whether it is breaking any antitrust laws with its practices to spur a closer look. This isn't quite a full investigation ...yet Details of the purported agreement are still slim and neither of the agencies has, as of this writing, commented on the matter. For now, the sources claim that no full investigation is ongoing. Instead, the current iteration of the arrangement appears to center around splitting efforts to review the two companies between the agencies. Although either agency retains the option to take action based on any findings of the probe, it won't necessarily lead to any actions being taken either.

First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds. There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anti-corporate left and the good-government center. There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzzfeed wrote last week, that the online giants' \"golden age\" of political immunity is ending, and that it might be \"normal politics, normal regulation\" from here on out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second, one of these giants - Amazon - is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead.</p><p>The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which U.S. metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications. The New York Times' The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Ore.; Denver; Boston; and D.C. - and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living.</p><p>The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on the right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question: What if Amazon treated its headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture? What if it approached the decision as an opportunity to push back against trends driving populist suspicion of big business - educational and geographic polarization, coastal growth and heartland decay, the sense that the New Economy creates wealth but not jobs and that its tycoons are loyal to globalization rather than their country?</p><p>Amazon can't realistically spread its offices and jobs across America's most isolated and despairing counties. But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state - think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options - not Boston but Hartford, Conn., not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport, Connt. Or it could pick a big, battered, declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit.</p><p>A particularly compelling pick, according to my extremely nonscientific \"what's good for America\" metric, might be St. Louis - a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West.</p><p>Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense. The company is not a charity, and making itself the prisoner of a disastrous investment won't ultimately help anyone except its rivals.</p><p>But it's hard to know with any real certainty what the best long-term geographic investment for the company would be. The fact that tech companies tend to cluster doesn't mean that a uniquely rich and powerful company couldn't benefit from having a city of its own. The fact that bright young singletons gravitate toward coastal urbs right now doesn't mean that you couldn't attract talent - especially married-with-kids talent - to a heartland city whose Amazon District took advantage of sprawling housing stock left over from a prosperous past. Depending on which elements on Amazon's wish list you weight most heavily, you can make a great variety of cities score impressively - from Bridgeport to Provo, Utah; Detroit to Rochester, N.Y.</p><p>Ultimately, as Lyman Stone, a prolific Department of Agriculture cotton economist, points out in a piece on Amazon's decision, there is no city that comes close to meeting all of the company's requirements: \"No matter where Amazon goes, they will have to build their own fundamentals.\" And no matter where the company goes, what it builds will change that city radically - so a static analysis of any destination will only take you so far.</p><p>If Donald Trump were the deal-making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with Jeff Bezos right now, making a case along these very lines - while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business.</p><p>I don't have a strong view - yet - on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities. But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind of pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as if what's good for America is good for Amazon as well.</p><p>Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times.

Advertising and AWS are both seeing faster growth than Amazon's core retail business, Thill noted, and both are also higher margin businesses than e-commerce. Thill thinks Amazon's advertising business will see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% between 2018 and 2022, while AWS could see a CAGR of 30% in that period, versus the core e-commerce's rate of 13%. </p><p>While Thill thinks Amazon's Advertising, AWS and third-party seller retail businesses will comprise 44% of the company's total revenue by 2022, the fatter profit margins in those segments will cause them to contribute 66% of Amazon's overall valuation. \"We have high confidence these high recurring revenue/high-margin businesses warrant higher multiples than the core business and expect investors to recognize their embedded value,\" Thill said. </p><p>Amazon faces growing competition in e-commerce, and some analysts have recently tabbed  than Amazon for exposure to big tech, as Amazon faces greater anti-trust scrutiny than Netflix  .

If regulators find evidence that Amazon engaged in anti-competitive practices and file a federal complaint, the company could face enforcement actions ranging from new regulations to an order to split up assets. Any legal action is likely to take months if not years to resolve due to additional litigation and appeals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon could adapt to new regulations, but an order to separate business segments would be particularly problematic, said Franklin Turner, an attorney with McCarter &amp; English LLP, who represents companies ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses.</p><p>\"It could cause deleterious impacts to revenue streams and profit forecasts,\" Turner said in an interview. \"It could affect the company from top to bottom, everything from the attractiveness of the company to investors to all sorts of business endeavors.\"</p><p>Amazon did not respond to inquiries for this story. But antitrust experts say breakups are among the most severe   and rare   actions that regulators can take.</p><p>\"The investigation is only part one, the agencies then have to go to court to prove a case to a judge   if they bring one,\" Avery Gardiner, senior fellow for Competition, Data, and Power at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on digital rights policy, said in an interview.</p><p>U.S. Attorney General William Barr has prioritized probes of multinational digital companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.Source: The Associated Press</p><p>Political pressure</p><p>The FTC is under \"tremendous pressure\" to complete its probe in 2020, given that enforcers are looking at company behavior that occurred over the past 12 to 24 months, said Gardiner, a former U.S. Department of Justice lawyer. The U.S. election cycle will likely compound that pressure, she added.</p><p>\"I think as a general matter they might prefer to try to wrap things up with the administration they know,\" she said.</p><p>The FTC declined to comment for this story. The agency in 2019 began investigating Amazon's relationship with the company's third-party sellers, which account for more than half of Amazon's total unit sales online.</p><p>Separately, the DOJ announced in July 2019 that it was reviewing whether Amazon or leading digital platforms such as Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC engaged in anti-competitive practices.</p><p>Antitrust experts said regulators could bring a case against Amazon if they find proof that the company is favoring its private-label goods over those of third-party sellers.</p><p>Amazon officials told lawmakers in November 2019 that it uses \"aggregated data\" collected from sales on its platform to improve the shopping experience, adding that its private-label strategy is informed by a variety of factors, including \"the cost of the product and the price of similar, popular products offered in Amazon's store and by competitors.\" As of 2019, Amazon offered about 158,000 private brand products across 45 brands in its Amazon store.</p><p>Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson who has been following tech companies since the 1990s, said in an interview that a key question was whether Amazon used that data to make decisions about which private label products to offer.</p><p>\"Does Amazon see that there's a lot of this product selling on our platform, [and decide] now I'm going to create the Amazon private label version of it?\" he asked.</p><p>Forte said regulators may also be looking at whether Amazon is using data from its cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services Inc. to suppress competitors and promote private-label products.</p><p>If regulators find evidence to support that, they could ask the court to order a spinoff of AWS, which recorded $25.6 billion in revenue in 2018. However, such an action would be rare.</p><p>Big Tech acquisitions</p><p>Amazon and the other firms have grown through a mix of acquisitions and organic growth, but enforcers have been reluctant to make competitive concerns about deals the basis of a lawsuit, the experts said.</p><p>According to the independent nonprofit group American Antitrust Institute, regulators have only challenged one deal out of more than 700 acquisitions by big tech firms between 1987 and 2019.</p><p>Google accounted for 32% of the big tech total with 234 deals, followed by Microsoft Corp., with 221 acquisitions, or 31%. Amazon had an 11% share with 83 deals. Some of Amazon's biggest deals occurred in the last few years, including the purchase of Whole Foods Market Inc. in 2017 and online pharmacy PillPack in 2018.</p><p>U.S. enforcement agencies have an \"incredibly weak record of enforcement in digital technology,\" said Diana Moss, president of AAI, in an interview. Many regulators are concerned about stifling competition, she added.</p><p>\"The question is whether the agencies are going to break out of the historical mode, which is not to bring cases,\" Moss said.</p><p>Forte said regulators may be looking at Amazon's deal with Whole Foods, which enabled the company to jump into the grocery business and expand its physical footprint with stores across the U.S.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is running for president, said in early 2019 that under her administration, regulators would work to undo mergers deemed anti-competitive, pointing to Amazon's Whole Foods purchase, among other big tech acquisitions ripe for review.</p><p>Possible remedies</p><p>If a federal case is filed this year, the more likely legal remedy would be behavioral, antitrust experts said.</p><p>The court could, for example, require Amazon to give third-party retailers some period of notice before changing a policy or order the company to put up firewalls that prevent business units from communicating, Gardiner said. That may include requiring Amazon to restrict some employees' access to data on which products are trending online.</p><p>While the agencies could ask a court to order a breakup of assets, and a district court could agree to do so, Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University School of Law, said in an interview that \"absent evidence of extensive and egregious wrong-doing,\" a complete breakup of a tech company's assets seems \"very far-fetched.\"</p><p>The popularity of services such as Amazon's e-commerce platform also could undermine the case that big tech's growth can be explained primarily by anti-competitive conduct, he added.</p><p>\"They have grown because people like their products and services and use them,\" he said. \"You can t break up a company for success.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-56399662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-X3Y1-JDVW-N069-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

A partner at Bain .... argues banks can withstand pressure from Amazon if they focus on one key area.When the news hit that Amazon[1] was in talks with several banks to launch a \"checking account-like product[2],\" naturally everyone feared the worst. After all, this is a company that's taken multi-billion-dollar bites out of at least five major industries[3] in the past year, often with only minor announcements. Armed with a war chest of cash and an ever-expanding network of customers, Amazon isn't afraid to throw its weight around. </p><p>But the situation for banks may not be as dire as some seem to think \u2014 at least yet. That's according to Maureen Burns[4], a Boston-based partner at consulting firm Bain .... and a co-author of a recent report analyzing Amazon's foray[5] into financial services. She argues banks already have some inherent advantages, and could withstand pressure from Amazon if they focus on customer service. \"Banks are in a position where they can catch up, and do it quickly,\" Burns told Business Insider by phone. \"They need to identify where their customer experience lags, and find the right partners to get the experience to the level of a big tech provider.\" In particular, there seems to be some catching up to do when it comes to digital channels. In the Bain .... report, the firm found that only aroundhalf of US survey respondents strongly agreed that their primary bank's website lets them do everything they need. That percentage fell to 31% for primary bank apps. In contrast,US millennialslist Amazon as the app they can't live without.[6] But for now, banks still have a leg up when it comes to their massive balance sheets, which offer the type of liquidity necessary to run a checking account operation, says Burns. She also notes that whatever banking business Amazon does launch will need the regulatory clearance and backing that big banks currently have. With those two elements already working in their favor, Burns says it's up to banks to improve their outward-facing interactions with clients. In the end, her point is that while Amazon needs to rely on the cooperation of large financial institutions, all banks have to do is focus on themselves. \"It's not simple to change a banking relationship, so customers do it when they get really frustrated, or can't do what they want to do,\" said Burns. \"Banks need to get ahead of that.\" Easier said than done? Perhaps. But no one ever said fighting off Amazon would be easy.Navigating the 'trust gap'The topic of trust and how it impacts consumer behavior is something Burns touched upon frequently, whileBain's recent study[7]also discusses it in detail. And based on their findings, it's a factor that could very well decide how things unfold as Amazon pushes into banking. To hear Bain tell it, the company is off to a great start, with a trust ranking that puts its mega-cap technology peers to shame. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows consumers are far more likely to trust Amazon with their money than the likes of Apple[8], Google[9], Microsoft[10], or Facebook[11].You'll notice, however, the massive chasm that still exists between Amazon and primary banks. It suggests Amazon still has a ways to go \u2014 although Burns notes the difference used to be far more pronounced. \"The trust gap between banks and tech players wasn't as big as we would've thought, and it's getting smaller,\" said Burns. \"But client trust, and convincing people to put money with them, is still an enormous barrier.\" With that in mind, if big banks are truly going to withstand Amazon's last industry-disrupting push, they'll also have to combat chief executive officer Jeff Bezos' famous mantra: \"Your margin is my opportunity.\"[12] And that may be the toughest task of all \u2014 since they're nowhere near as diversified as Amazon, which makes them ill-equipped to deal with a margin squeeze. \"[Amazon's] model is about getting into a bunch of things, innovating, being willing to experiment, being willing to take risks, being willing to lose money \u2014 and then finding the really profitable places where they can play,\" said Burns. \"Banks absolutely need to be thinking about this. Amazon looks to be in it for the long game.\"NOW WATCH: The surprising reason why NASA hasn't sent humans to Mars yet[13]See Also: GOLDMAN SACHS WARNS: Risks are rising that bitcoin will fall through

Warren/APAmazon is expected to become the third largest digital advertiser, behind Facebook and Google, according to eMarketer researchers. But as the company's market share of the ad and retail business continues to expand, the company may run into the same kind of scrutiny that has dogged other large ad platforms, such as Google's. Some observers already see behavior that makes it difficult for smaller third-party manufacturers that sell through Amazon to compete. The retailer's ad business is growing at a time when regulators in the US and Europe are taking a hard look at the business practices of big retailers and tech giants.Researchers with eMarketer tell the Wall Street Journal[1] that Amazon could soon become the third largest US digital advertiser, behind Google and Facebook \u2014 an impressive benchmark considering ads are a side business for the web's biggest retailer. But as the Amazon continues to grow its ad business, it must prove that it can avoid the same regulatory scrutiny that has plagued other powerful ad platforms, such as Google search andFacebook's social network.[2]More specifically to Amazon's core retail business, CEO Jeff Bezos must be careful not to alienate customers with the glut of ads that are now far more prevalent at his web store. </p><p> \"There's an interesting debate right now, about whether the ads are customer-centric enough,\" saidAndrea Leigh, vice president of client services at Ideoclick, a Seattle-based ecommerce consultancy, in an interview with Business Insider. Amazon representatives were not immediately available for comment. Researchers from eMarketer on Wednesday estimated that Amazon willgenerate \"$4.6B in domestic ad revenue.\" The research firm said that Amazon's share of the overall market will reach approximately 4.2 percent. That's enough for the retailer to overtake Microsoft and Oath, the Verizon-owned media site, in digital advertising. The two largest players, Google and Facebook, hold a combined 58 percent of the market with $64 billion, eMarketer says. Amazon's $5 billion is tiny in comparison, but the retailer's ad business is growing faster [3]than either of the two frontrunners, according to analysts. Amazon appears ready to cut deeper into Google and Facebook's market share. Before that can happen, however, it has to avoid the same regulatory hurdles that has at times tripped up each of them. The news of Amazon's ad growth comes as lawmakers in the United States and Europe are looking at whether some of the business practices of big tech companies are anticompetitive.Google has been accused multiple times of tweaking search results to favor ads for its own products and services over rivals. Last year, the European Union hitGoogle with a $2.8 billion fine [4]after deciding the company had done exactly this. Google is appealing that ruling.Certainly, Google has a much larger share of search than Amazon has of retail and market share is always a factor in how regulators decide if a business is anticompetitive. But Amazon's share of the retail market continues to expandMore than half of all product searches occur on Amazon, Leigh said. Amazon is starting to attract the same sort of scrutiny in Europe that has dogged Google. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday[5] that the EU has begun a preliminary probe into how Amazon treats the merchants that sell via its platform. One doesn't have to look too deeply into Amazon's ad business to discover some eyebrow-raising behavior, say observers. Keying in a search term for any product on Amazon and the top part of the search-results page is typically stuffed with ads. The ads belong to companies that bid on and purchase the right to advertise in this all-important area of Amazon site's. During a presentation at theCode Commerce conference on Tuesday, Leigh told attendees that Amazon is sometimes \"predatory\" in its advertising practices, according to the HubSpot Marketing Blog[6]. She said Amazon will sometimes reserve the valuable real estate on its search-result pages for its own private-label products, Leigh said on stage, adding that sometimes Amazon will even display theads on a competing product's detail page. In an interview Wednesday with Business Insider, Leigh said: \"It used to be people would log on to Amazon and a good product with a good price could go viral. Now, it's all pay to play. It's hard for a brand, without some financial means, to compete.\" When asked whether this was legal, Leigh said she was not a lawyer or an expert at antitrust. She did, however, say Amazon's practices appear to be effective. She said that Facebook and Google and other players in the digital ad business \"should be afraid.\"  And as for the possibility that shoppers could be turned off by the addition of so many ads at Amazon, Leigh said that this is one of the big questions in the ad business. \"Amazon bases their ads on how relevant they are to customers,\" Leigh said. \"If ads are really relevant to you, do you mind? I think that the answer is you don't mind.\"NOW WATCH: Apple might introduce three new iPhones this year \u2014 here's what we know[7]See Also: 13 rules to help your business survive a game-changing

CNBC scoured Amazon's site and found numerous examples of products such as Doritos[3], beef jerky[4], and baby food[5], which had complaints from customers about the items they received being stale or out-of-date. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider that it has \"proactive processes in place to ensure customers receive products with sufficient shelf life.\" It's unclear how effective Amazon is at policing these rules. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[6] Amazon's sprawling and increasingly controversial third-party marketplace became the subject of a fresh investigation on Sunday. This time it came from CNBC[7], which shed light on dozens of reviews from angry customers who say they were sent expired food after ordering from third-party sellers on Amazon's site. CNBC scoured the site to find numerous examples of products such as Doritos[8], beef jerky[9], and baby food[10], which had complaints from customers about the item being stale, moldy, or out-of-date. In some cases, customers found that items had expired as much as a year before. In one review of Half ...lf creamers from 2017[11], a customer said that while the product was in date, it was due to expire within the next 47 days and given that there were 360 creamers, this seemed like an impossible task. \"I can't possibly use 360 in that period of time. This box had a red label hiding the expiration date and there was a line drawn by a marker pen under the label. I have bought boxes of the Carnation Half ...lf from Amazon many times that were not close to expiring. Usually I have almost 3 months to use them,\" the angry customer wrote[12]. In a statement emailed to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Amazon said it has \"proactive processes in place to ensure customers receive products with sufficient shelf life\"; these processes are listed online[13] but it's unclear how effective Amazon is at proactively policing these rules. Still, the spokesperson said that if Amazon does find a product that doesn't meet its guidelines, it is quickly removed. \"If customers have concerns about items they've purchased, we encourage them to contact our Customer Service directly to investigate and take appropriate action,\" he said. This isn't the first time Amazon has come under scrutiny for the items sold through its marketplace, its vast network of third-party sellers which sell and distribute items through the Amazon network. In September, a Wall Street Journal[14] report revealed that thousands of items sold on its site were not deemed safe by regulators. Most concerningly, these items included children's toys and medication for adults. Read more: Amazon was caught selling thousands of items that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies[15] CNBC put together its investigation with help from data analytics firm 3PM. 3PM's chief product officer Jon Derkits - who worked at Amazon until June managing the third-party consumer electronics division - told CNBC that Amazon was addressing these food expiry issues but that there were still \"big gaps\" in its inability to prevent customers from receiving out-of-date goods. \"They hadn't yet earned my trust, as either an Amazon employee or a customer, that I would be safe purchasing a consumable or expiration-dated product from a third-party seller,\" he told CNBC.Read the full report from CNBC here[16].

The company demonstrated a \u201cstrong continued interest\u201d in the sector, based on information uncovered in internal documents, and its decision to use the Deliveroo deal instead of re-entering the market on its own would trigger a competition issue.</p><p>In its response to the decision, Amazon said: \u201cA homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and \u00adsupporters.\u201d</p><p>Deliveroo, which generated sales just shy of \u00a3500m last year, said it was confident it would \u201cpersuade the CMA\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009 that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders and increasing choice for customers.\u201d </p><p>The CMA move comes as the watchdog attempts to crack down on the dominance of big tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, and as it weighs plans for a new regulator to police such companies. </p><p>\u201cThe regulator clearly feels it needs to show they leave no stone unturned when it comes to big tech,\u201d said one competition lawyer close to the deal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-851fbc581c0711ea91867348c2f183af</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPV-2D41-DXP9-9017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><timeReceived>11:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Remedy Principle</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFDNkU4MkVBMjhFNDdDNTk1MzNFRDA0REZDRjkwQkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENDNjZGMThDNzYwNDA3RjhERDREQUJENkIyQkM3Rjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

Amazon closed its own delivery company, Amazon Restaurants, in 2018.</p><p>The CMA also said that in the nascent field of grocery delivery, the two companies are rivals with \u201cmajor expansion plans\u201d, and that a tie-up could lessen competition. Deliveroo has been experimenting with rapid deliveries from Co-op and Sainsbury\u2019s convenience stores, while Amazon has a tie-up with Morrisons, the supermarket chain, for same-day online grocery deliveries in some UK cities.</p><p>Neither company was able to offer remedies for the CMA\u2019s concerns.</p><p>The in-depth probe signals a further six months of uncertainty for Deliveroo. The company last raised money, prior to the Amazon deal, in September 2017 and reported losses of almost \u00a3185m in 2018. </p><p>A spokesperson said Deliveroo had been working closely with the CMA and was confident it would persuade the regulator that the deal \u201cwill add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers.\u201d</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cA homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters.\u201d</p><p>The probe could affect Deliveroo\u2019s London-based rival Just Eat, whose shareholders are weighing rival final bids from Naspers and Takeaway.com. Takeaway.com\u2019s higher, all-share offer foresees less investment into Just Eat, and has the backing of 40 per cent of shareholders. </p><p>\u201cClearly, any reduction in Deliveroo\u2019s firepower could reduce the investment required in Just Eat\u2019s core UK market,\u201d analysts at Citigroup said in a note to clients earlier this month. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article has been amended to reflect the fact that the CMA is not responsible for setting up any new UK technology regulator</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-bed7c4d828c111ea9a4f963f0ec7e134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV8-WR91-JB77-K29M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><timeReceived>6:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

Around the world, we are proud of our strong safety and labor compliance record,\" Amazon said.</p><p>\"We pay a flat amount for every delivery block and also provide additional payments in some circumstances including reimbursement of tolls incurred whilst delivering for Amazon Flex.</p><p>\" When you take the overall payments into account for the services provided, our pricing structure meets or exceeds the minimum industry rates.\"</p><p>Nick McIntosh, national assistant secretary at the TWU, said claiming to \"meet or exceed regulatory requirements\" meant little in the gig economy, which has been purpose-built by big tech to avoid all regulation so it can pay below-average remuneration.</p><p>Because they're not employed by Amazon, Flex drivers won't be covered by usual employer provisions governing minimum pay and safe working conditions, he said.</p><p>The only way to ensure the safety and wellbeing of gig-economy drivers would be to reinstate something similar to the national Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was abolished by the Turnbull government in 2016, the TWU said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78zeq4dmxop1558sx2i1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2W-K9F1-JD34-V4FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Gazelle Sports, the running-shoe and apparel business he founded in downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 1985, had grown steadily for decades, adding locations in Grand Rapids and Detroit and swelling to some 170 employees. But then, in 2014, sales took a downward turn. From the outside, at least, it was hard to see why. Gazelle Sports was as beloved as ever by local runners. People continued to flock to its free clinics and community runs. And scores of enthusiastic reviews on Google and Yelp, along with an industry ranking as one of the best running-shoe retailers in the country, gave Gazelle Sports and its e-commerce website plenty of prominence in online searches.1</p><p>The problem wasn't so much that customers had made a conscious decision to buy their running gear elsewhere, Lampen-Crowell says. Rather, a number were doing more of their overall shopping on Amazon-and as the online giant became a pervasive, almost unconscious habit in their lives, they had started dropping into their Amazon shopping carts some of the items they used to buy from Gazelle Sports. Lampen-Crowell's initial response was to double down on marketing his company's own website. But while that helped, there were many potential customers who still had little chance of landing on it. That was because, by 2014, nearly 40 percent of people looking to buy something online were skipping search engines like Google altogether and instead starting their product searches directly on Amazon.2</p><p>By the fall of 2016, the share of online shoppers bypassing search engines and heading straight to Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13078526/amazon-online-shopping-product-search-engine\">had grown to 55 percent</url>. With sales flagging and staff reductions under way, Lampen-Crowell made what seemed like a necessary decision: Gazelle Sports would join Amazon Marketplace, becoming a third-party seller on the digital giant's platform. \"If the customer is on Amazon, as a small business you have to say, 'That is where I have to go,'\" Lampen-Crowell explains. \"Otherwise, we are going to close our doors.\"3</p><p>Gazelle Sports isn't alone. Faced with Amazon's overwhelming gravitational pull on the Internet's shopping traffic, thousands of Amazon's competitors-from small independent retailers to major chains and manufacturing brands-have felt compelled to join its orbit.4</p><p>Setting up shop on Amazon's platform has helped Gazelle Sports stabilize its sales. But it's also put the company on a treacherous footing. Amazon, which did not respond to an interview request, touts its platform as a place where entrepreneurs can \"pursue their dreams.\" Yet studies indicate that the relationship is often predatory. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=48334\">Harvard Business School researchers</url> found that when third-party sellers post new products, Amazon tracks the transactions and then starts selling many of their most popular items itself. And when it's not using the information that it gleans from sellers to compete against them, Amazon uses it to extract an ever larger cut of their revenue.5</p><p>To succeed, sellers need to \"win the buy-box\"-that is, be chosen by Amazon's algorithms as the default seller for a product. But according to ProPublica, \"about three-quarters of the time, Amazon placed its own products and those of companies that pay for its [warehousing and shipping] services in that position even when there were substantially cheaper offers available from others.\" As more third-party sellers have agreed to sign up for these services, Amazon has repeatedly raised its fees, with fulfillment fees rising this year by as much as 14 percent for standard-size items (and more for oversize goods), on top of similar increases in 2017.6</p><p>For now, Lampen-Crowell's primary suppliers have chosen not to sell directly to Amazon, giving Gazelle Sports and other independent retailers exclusive access to their products and, with it, a measure of insulation from Amazon's predatory tactics. That could change, however. In 2016, Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/birkenstock-quits-amazon-in-us-after-counterfeit-surge.html\">backed Birkenstock into a corner</url>, threatening to allow a deluge of counterfeit Birkenstocks onto its site-many from overseas sellers-unless the shoe company agreed to sell directly to Amazon the niche products it had previously reserved for specialty retailers. Birkenstock pushed back, but other companies, including Nike, appear to have caved to a similar demand.7</p><p>Lampen-Crowell tries not to spend time worrying about whether his suppliers will one day be pressured to do the same. An entrepreneur at heart, he keeps his focus on finding ways to succeed and doesn't let his attention stray too far into questions of Amazon's market power. \"Whether this is monopolization...\" he says, and then pauses. \"If you take this to the end, Amazon controls the rules.\"8</p><p>t's easy to mistake Amazon for a retailer. After all, the company, which was founded in 1995, sells more books and toys than any other retailer, and is projected soon to become the top seller of clothing and electronics. It now captures nearly $1 of every $2 that Americans spend online.9</p><p>To think of Amazon as a retailer, though, is to profoundly misjudge the scope of what its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has set out to do. It's not simply that Amazon does so much more than sell stuff-that it also produces hit television shows and movies; publishes books; designs digital devices; underwrites loans; delivers restaurant orders; sells a growing share of the Web's advertising; manages the data of US intelligence agencies; operates the world's largest streaming video-game platform; manufactures a growing array of products, from blouses to batteries; and is even venturing into health care.10</p><p>Instead, it's that Bezos has designed his company for a far more radical goal than merely dominating markets; he's built Amazon to replace them. His vision is for Amazon to become the underlying infrastructure that commerce runs on. Already, Amazon's website is the dominant platform for online retail sales, attracting half of all online US shopping traffic and hosting thousands of third-party sellers. Its Amazon Web Services division provides 34 percent of the world's cloud-computing capacity, handling the data of a long list of entities, from Netflix to Nordstrom, Comcast to Cond\u00e9 Nast to the CIA. Now, in a challenge to UPS and FedEx, Amazon is building out a vast shipping and delivery operation with the aim of handling both its own packages and those of other companies.11</p><p>By controlling these essential pieces of infrastructure, Amazon can privilege its own products and services as they move through these pipelines, siphoning off the most lucrative currents of consumer demand for itself. And it can set the terms by which other companies have access to these pipelines, while also levying, through the fees it charges, a tax on their trade. In other words, it's moving us away from a democratic political economy, in which commerce takes place in open markets governed by public rules, and toward a future in which the exchange of goods occurs in a private arena governed by Amazon. It's a setup that inevitably transfers wealth to the few-and with it, the power over such crucial questions as which books and ideas get published and promoted, who may ply a trade and on what terms, and whether given communities will succeed or fail.12</p><p>Amazon is \"something radically new in the history of American business,\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Yorker</emphasis> writer George Packer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/cheap-words\">has observed</url>. But it's not without antecedents. In the 19th century, men like Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller harnessed a disruptive new technology-the railroad-and used the control that it gave them over market access to weaken their industrial competitors and extort money from farmers and small businesses. Their actions sparked a broad movement against monopolies, which led, over the following decades, to the passage of a robust body of antitrust laws. The central purpose of these laws was to protect liberty and democracy from concentrated economic power, or what Franklin Roosevelt called \"industrial dictatorship.\"13</p><p>By the time Bezos set up his bookselling operation on the Internet, however, these laws were no longer being enforced in accordance with their original purpose. In the 1970s, an ideological revolution swept through the fields of law and economics. Led by the conservative legal scholar and former Nixon solicitor general Robert Bork, among others, this new school of thought dismissed concerns about the impact of monopolies on the rights of citizens and even on competition. Its proponents argued that antitrust law should be reduced to a single, narrow goal: maximizing efficiency. And efficiency, they insisted, was something that big, consolidated corporations could deliver better. These ideas were codified under Ronald Reagan, whose administration left the antitrust laws intact but altered the way that regulators interpreted and enforced them. These changes won support from an ascendant faction of liberals, who made efficiency more appealing by recasting it as the source of lower prices for consumers.14</p><p>\"Antitrust laws have been largely reduced to a technical tool to keep prices low,\" notes Lina Khan, director of legal policy at the Open Markets Institute. As a consequence, so long as Amazon has appeared to benefit consumers, it's been allowed to grow using tactics that would once have drawn antitrust scrutiny. Amazon has an extensive history, for example, of selling goods at a loss in order to wrest market share from competitors that lack the financial backing to sustain similar losses. Bezos, a former hedge-fund executive who has an unparalleled gift for selling his vision to Wall Street, has always been candid with investors about this strategy. In a letter to shareholders after the company went public in 1997, he wrote that he would prioritize \"long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability.\" Over the next six years, investors barely winced as Amazon lost $3 billion selling books and other items below cost. The investment paid off: Bookstores shut down in droves, and today nearly half of all books, both print and digital, are sold by Amazon.15</p><p>Amazon has also used below-cost selling to crush and absorb upstart competitors. In 2009, it acquired the popular shoe retailer Zappos after <url normalizedValue=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=t95iRvivDHIC&amp;pg=PT237&amp;lpg=PT237&amp;dq=Zappos++$150+million+Amazon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HAVwgYxCeo&amp;sig=V2oZly1Ntv6sXTFxEFEk9dGBUi8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx-KWPo5HXAhXJ54MKHYQbCQEQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Zappos%20%20%24150%20mil&amp;f=false\">reportedly losing $150 million</url> selling shoes below cost in order to force the rival company to the altar. Likewise, when Quidsi, the firm behind Diapers.com, emerged as a vigorous competitor,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Everything_Store.html?id=t95iRvivDHIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=quidsi&amp;f=false\">Amazon offered to buy it</url>; when Quidsi's founders refused, Amazon slashed its diaper prices below cost. Bleeding red ink, Quidsi eventually agreed to Amazon's offer. Over time, this behavior has had a restraining effect: Start-ups intent on challenging Amazon are unlikely to find investors and so never get off the ground. \"When you are small, someone else that is bigger can always come along and take away what you have,\" Bezos has said.16</p><p>Amazon's many tentacles provide it with novel ways to strong-arm suppliers. By leveraging the interplay between the different parts of its business-retail, e-commerce, manufacturing-it can amplify its market power over them. For instance, when Amazon began producing its own apparel two years ago, one aim was to erase the only real bargaining chip that fashion brands have: their ability to decline to sell to Amazon. Speaking at a fashion-industry event, Jeff Yurcisin, a vice president of Amazon Fashion, explained that uncooperative designers would now face knockoffs: \"When we see gaps, when certain brands have actually decided for their own reasons not to sell with us, our customer still wants a product like that.\"17</p><p>Amazon's dominance has been aided by Bezos's prescient grasp of how the seemingly wide-open Web could be turned into a winner-take-all environment. In 2005, Amazon launched Prime, a membership program that provides free two-day shipping and other perks for $99 a year. As a stand-alone service, Prime is a money-loser; Forrester Research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601889/how-amazon-loses-on-prime-and-still-wins/\">estimates that Amazon loses $1 billion a year on the shipping</url> alone. The point of getting people to fork over $99 has never been about the money, though-it's about the psychology. When people pay for Prime, they naturally want to maximize the value in free shipping they derive from it by doing more of their shopping on Amazon. Already, some 80 million Americans, accounting for more than half of the country's households, are Prime members. Studies show they are less likely to comparison-shop, and they spend almost twice as much with Amazon as non-Prime customers.18</p><p>With Alexa, Bezos has found a way to lure people even deeper into Amazon's ecosystem. Alexa is the voice assistant that powers the company's Echo speaker, and it makes buying from Amazon as effortless as a passing thought. \"The fact that it's always on, you never have to charge it, and it's there ready in your kitchen or your bedroom or wherever you put it, the fact that you can talk to it in a natural way-removes a lot of barriers, a lot of friction,\" Bezos has said of the speaker. One such friction is choice: If you ask Alexa for batteries, you won't get to choose Duracell or Energizer; Amazon's brand is the only option. With Alexa, Amazon will \"slowly but surely take control of your preferences,\" predicts Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University. The digital giant has already sold at least 20 million of these devices.19</p><p>Although Amazon continues to earn relatively meager profits compared with rivals like Walmart and Apple, its stock price has soared, almost doubling in value over the past 18 months and making Bezos the wealthiest person in the world. Investors see where this is heading. In 2016, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and owner of the Golden State Warriors, put a name to it: Amazon, he told an audience of fellow investors, \"is a multitrillion-dollar monopoly hiding in plain sight.\"20</p><p>What Amazon's giddy investors already understand, however, regulators have so far failed to grasp. Last June, Amazon announced its intention to buy Whole Foods. The deal gives Amazon a prominent foothold in the pivotal grocery industry and much else besides. With Whole Foods, Amazon gains new ways to cement its dominance online, including by extending its package-delivery infrastructure to 470 stores nestled among millions of urban consumers. And it allows the company to blur the distinction between online and offline retail, accelerating the spread of digitally driven commerce and, with it, Amazon's power. Yet, just two months after the deal was announced, the Federal Trade Commission gave it the green light, concluding that the merger did not warrant an in-depth review.21</p><p>s it grows, Amazon is exposing the deficiencies of the Reagan-era changes in how we think about corporate concentration. By collapsing antitrust enforcement to consider only prices, we have lost sight of what earlier generations knew about monopolies: that they can harm us as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">producers</emphasis> of value, not merely as consumers of it. And their control over our livelihoods and the fate of our communities is inherently political: It's a threat to liberty and democracy.22</p><p>Economists have recently begun to document a link between corporate concentration and rising inequality. Dominant companies, they're finding, are funneling the spoils to a small number of people at the top. And by reducing the number of their competitors, these companies are also making it harder for workers to get a fair wage and for producers to get a fair price. A particularly troubling data point in this research is the loss of a long-standing pathway to a middle-class life: starting a business. The number of new firms launched each year has <url normalizedValue=\"http://eig.org/dynamism\">fallen by nearly two-thirds since 1980</url>, and many economists believe that corporate power is to blame. This lack of start-ups is fueling a broader decline in the ranks of small business: Between 2005 and 2015, the number of small retailers fell by 85,000, a drop of 21 percent relative to population.23</p><p>In this story of concentrated power and wealth, Amazon is a central character. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://indiebizadvocates.org/2016/02/10/2016-independent-business-survey/\">a 2016 survey</url>, independent retailers ranked competition from Internet retailers like Amazon as the biggest threat to their businesses, more worrisome than big-box stores or rising health-insurance costs. And their decline is having ripple effects up the supply chain. As more of the market shifts to a single gatekeeper, manufacturers say they are having a harder time introducing new products. Local businesses \"are in a much better position as small retailers to do that boot-strapping,\" says Michael Levins, the founder of Innovative Kids, a book and puzzle producer that's been in business for 29 years.24</p><p>At the same time that many communities are seeing local businesses disappear, they're also losing retail jobs. This past year, more people lost jobs in general-merchandise stores than the total number of workers in the coal industry. Even as Amazon expands its network of warehouses, it isn't creating enough jobs to make up for the losses it's causing. The basic math of what's under way is startling: Retail accounts for about one in 10 American jobs, and Amazon needs only half as many workers to distribute the same volume of goods as traditional stores require. Plus it's likely to need even fewer workers in the future: Since 2015, Amazon has invited elite engineering teams to compete in an annual robotics challenge. Their mission is to design a robot that can select and grasp assorted items, a task that, for now, only humans can do.25</p><p>This kind of wholesale upending of an industry happens periodically, and, as a rule, we don't run out of jobs. But today, in the absence of a flush of new businesses creating new opportunities, work for many people has become increasingly precarious-and, in the case of Amazon workers, punishing. People who work inside the company's warehouses <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/amazon-warehouses-poor-cities/552020/\">describe the pace as grueling</url>, with \"unit-per-hour\" rates set so high that failure and exhaustion are routine. Amazon's approach to work is at once futuristic and a throwback to labor's distant past. Robots zip around, laden with products, while many of the people they interface with are temporary employees. Amazon calls these workers \"seasonal,\" but, in fact, it relies on them year-round.26</p><p>As it moves into package delivery, Amazon is bringing its labor model along, relying in part on Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own vehicles, take directions from an app, and are paid a piece rate for each batch of boxes they deliver. The impacts are already being felt at the US Postal Service and UPS, whose hundreds of thousands of unionized employees constitute one of the last surviving corners of the working middle class. A few months ago, over the objections of the Teamsters union, UPS began placing ads for drivers who will use their own vehicles.27</p><p>As a result of the economic shifts that Amazon is helping to propel, the country is being divided into a starkly unequal geography. Only a handful of metro areas are gaining significant numbers of good jobs from Big Tech. And as the formation of new businesses declines, they're also being consolidated into fewer places: <url normalizedValue=\"http://eig.org/dynamism\">In contrast with previous recoveries</url>, when new firms were widely dispersed, half of all businesses started between 2010 and 2014 were located in just five metro areas. Even winning cities are marked by disparity: In Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, the median home value now exceeds $700,000, while the unsheltered homeless population doubled over 10 years. It's not hard to imagine a future in which Amazon's cashier-less supermarkets and nondescript bookstores populate better-off neighborhoods, while other communities become increasingly barren of commercial activity.28</p><p>In the left-behind towns and neighborhoods, the despair that has set in stems from more than just economic hardship. There is a pervasive sense of powerlessness that is toxic to democracy. In 1946, the sociologist C. Wright Mills and the economist Melville J. Ulmer <url normalizedValue=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435001259803;view=1up;seq=10\">published a detailed study</url> of several matched pairs of cities. The cities in each pair were similar in all respects except for one main difference: One city's economy was composed of many locally owned firms, while the other's was largely controlled by absentee corporations. The cities that possessed a degree of local economic power had a bigger middle class and a greater variety of jobs, Mills and Ulmer found. But their most important findings had to do with civic health. The cities with a robust local economy invested more in public infrastructure and services, and their residents were involved in community affairs in greater numbers.29</p><p>Today, using large-scale statistical techniques, sociologists have confirmed Mills and Ulmer's broad conclusions, finding, for example, that communities that possess more local economic power are better able to solve problems. But these ideas are no longer reflected in policy. Now, instead of actively seeking to disperse economic power, policy-makers encourage its concentration. Many elected officials are as enthralled with Bezos as his investors are, and they've been equally willing to fund Amazon's growth. Congress has repeatedly declined to pass legislation that would allow states to require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes. This allowed Amazon to largely avoid collecting sales taxes for nearly two decades, giving it a price advantage <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2422403\">that research shows helped drive shoppers to its site</url>. Then, as Amazon's warehouse expansion began to compel its compliance with sales taxes, the company started angling for local development incentives. It's raked in more than $1.1 billion through these deals,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/amazon-tracker\">according to Good Jobs First</url>, and more than half of the warehouses that Amazon built between 2005 and 2015 received public subsidies.30</p><p>Then, last fall, Amazon set off a frenzied bidding war to land its second headquarters. In the ensuing months, as the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-says-238-cities-are-competing-for-hq2-2017-10\">leaders of more than 200 cities</url> groveled to attract the company's eye, they sent a clear message to their constituents: Amazon's widening reach is something to be wished for fervently. For Amazon, this public-relations windfall-coming at the very moment when some are beginning to question its power, and propelled, in many cases, by leading progressive mayors-may prove even more valuable than the subsidies that elected officials are offering. And those offers have been astonishingly large: Maryland is dangling $5 billion, along with close proximity to Congress. In New Jersey, meanwhile, Senator Cory Booker, former governor Chris Christie, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka put together an offer worth $7 billion. That's $2 billion more than Amazon says its new headquarters will cost.31</p><p>n June of 2016, Senator Elizabeth Warren gave <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">a headline-grabbing speech</url> calling for action to check monopoly power. She singled out several dominant companies, including Amazon, noting that \"the platform can become a tool to snuff out competition.\" And she argued that we should use antitrust policy to break up concentrations of power and broaden opportunity, presenting a progressive economic vision that has more to offer people than simply an enhanced social safety net.32</p><p>In recent months, a growing number of political leaders have started to make the case for restoring antitrust policy to its former strength and purpose. The US House of Representatives now hosts the newly formed Antitrust Caucus. Its founders include Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), who, interestingly, hails from Silicon Valley, and who urged antitrust enforcers last summer to undertake a much more thorough review of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger than they did. Another member is Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), who's been outspoken about the destructive power of dominant tech platforms to manipulate consumers and impede start-ups. The caucus's first piece of legislation, which would require the antitrust agencies to retrospectively review the effects of mergers they have approved, has been introduced by Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN), who believes that \"massive monopolies are threatening our democracy.\"33</p><p>Democrats aren't the only ones pushing for a more muscular approach to monopolies. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican and candidate for the US Senate, has launched an antitrust investigation of Google.34</p><p>How might we use the tools of antitrust law to check Amazon's power? One approach would break the company into two pieces by spinning off its e-commerce platform from its retail operation, thereby eliminating the conflict inherent in controlling market access for one's competitors. We could then designate the resulting platform company as a common carrier, obligating it to offer all sellers access on equal terms, just as we did with the railroads. Alongside this, we need to once again police predatory pricing, the practice of selling goods below cost to drive out competition. Antitrust enforcers and the courts dismissed predatory pricing as a concern in the 1980s on the grounds that the tactic rarely succeeds. Amazon has shown otherwise.35</p><p>Amazon will undoubtedly respond to any effort to rein it in by making its dominance seem like the inevitable outcome of technological progress. When Bezos was asked several years ago about his company's effect on publishers and booksellers, he responded: \"Amazon is not happening to bookselling; the future is happening to bookselling.\" Bezos would like us to believe that we shouldn't expect to enjoy the benefits of the digital revolution without surrendering our markets to Amazon's control. But history tells a different story: Federal antitrust cases against AT&amp;T, IBM, and Microsoft all produced a surge of innovation and start-up activity in their wake.36</p><p>Back in Michigan, Lampen-Crowell is eager to compete. He's added a series of injury-prevention workshops to the calendar, along with a schedule of weekly runs with various goals, from improving speed to helping residents stay active during the state's long winters. The question now is whether we as citizens will insist that this business, and many others like it, have a fair chance to succeed.37</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-272558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-BBD1-DXR3-23T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Gazelle Sports, the running-shoe and apparel business he founded in downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 1985, had grown steadily for decades, adding locations in Grand Rapids and Detroit and swelling to some 170 employees. But then, in 2014, sales took a downward turn. From the outside, at least, it was hard to see why. Gazelle Sports was as beloved as ever by local runners. People continued to flock to its free clinics and community runs. And scores of enthusiastic reviews on Google and Yelp, along with an industry ranking as one of the best running-shoe retailers in the country, gave Gazelle Sports and its e-commerce website plenty of prominence in online searches.1 Ad Policy[2] The problem wasn't so much that customers had made a conscious decision to buy their running gear elsewhere, Lampen-Crowell says. Rather, a number were doing more of their overall shopping on Amazon\u2014and as the online giant became a pervasive, almost unconscious habit in their lives, they had started dropping into their Amazon shopping carts some of the items they used to buy from Gazelle Sports. Lampen-Crowell's initial response was to double down on marketing his company's own website. But while that helped, there were many potential customers who still had little chance of landing on it. That was because, by 2014, nearly 40 percent of people looking to buy something online were skipping search engines like Google altogether and instead starting their product searches directly on Amazon.2 By the fall of 2016, the share of online shoppers bypassing search engines and heading straight to Amazon had grown to 55 percent. With sales flagging and staff reductions under way, Lampen-Crowell made what seemed like a necessary decision: Gazelle Sports would join Amazon Marketplace, becoming a third-party seller on the digital giant's platform. 'If the customer is on Amazon, as a small business you have to say, 'That is where I have to go,'' Lampen-Crowell explains. 'Otherwise, we are going to close our doors.'3 Gazelle Sports isn't alone. Faced with Amazon's overwhelming gravitational pull on the Internet's shopping traffic, thousands of Amazon's competitors\u2014from small independent retailers to major chains and manufacturing brands\u2014have felt compelled to join its orbit.4 Setting up shop on Amazon's platform has helped Gazelle Sports stabilize its sales. But it's also put the company on a treacherous footing. Amazon, which did not respond to an interview request, touts its platform as a place where entrepreneurs can 'pursue their dreams.' Yet studies indicate that the relationship is often predatory. Harvard Business School researchers found that when third-party sellers post new products, Amazon tracks the transactions and then starts selling many of their most popular items itself. And when it's not using the information that it gleans from sellers to compete against them, Amazon uses it to extract an ever larger cut of their revenue.5 To succeed, sellers need to 'win the buy-box'\u2014that is, be chosen by Amazon's algorithms as the default seller for a product. But according to ProPublica, 'about three-quarters of the time, Amazon placed its own products and those of companies that pay for its [warehousing and shipping] services in that position even when there were substantially cheaper offers available from others.' As more third-party sellers have agreed to sign up for these services, Amazon has repeatedly raised its fees, with fulfillment fees rising this year by as much as 14 percent for standard-size items (and more for oversize goods), on top of similar increases in 2017.6For now, Lampen-Crowell's primary suppliers have chosen not to sell directly to Amazon, giving Gazelle Sports and other independent retailers exclusive access to their products and, with it, a measure of insulation from Amazon's predatory tactics. That could change, however. In 2016, Amazon backed Birkenstock into a corner, threatening to allow a deluge of counterfeit Birkenstocks onto its site\u2014many from overseas sellers\u2014unless the shoe company agreed to sell directly to Amazon the niche products it had previously reserved for specialty retailers. Birkenstock pushed back, but other companies, including Nike, appear to have caved to a similar demand.7Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/march-5-2018-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/march-5-2018-issue/</url> Lampen-Crowell tries not to spend time worrying about whether his suppliers will one day be pressured to do the same. An entrepreneur at heart, he keeps his focus on finding ways to succeed and doesn't let his attention stray too far into questions of Amazon's market power. 'Whether this is monopolization' he says, and then pauses. 'If you take this to the end, Amazon controls the rules.'8 It's easy to mistake Amazon for a retailer. After all, the company, which was founded in 1995, sells more books and toys than any other retailer, and is projected soon to become the top seller of clothing and electronics. It now captures nearly $1 of every $2 that Americans spend online.9 To think of Amazon as a retailer, though, is to profoundly misjudge the scope of what its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has set out to do. It's not simply that Amazon does so much more than sell stuff\u2014that it also produces hit television shows and movies; publishes books; designs digital devices; underwrites loans; delivers restaurant orders; sells a growing share of the Web's advertising; manages the data of US intelligence agencies; operates the world's largest streaming video-game platform; manufactures a growing array of products, from blouses to batteries; and is even venturing into health care.10 Instead, it's that Bezos has designed his company for a far more radical goal than merely dominating markets; he's built Amazon to replace them. His vision is for Amazon to become the underlying infrastructure that commerce runs on. Already, Amazon's website is the dominant platform for online retail sales, attracting half of all online US shopping traffic and hosting thousands of third-party sellers. Its Amazon Web Services division provides 34 percent of the world's cloud-computing capacity, handling the data of a long list of entities, from Netflix to Nordstrom, Comcast to Cond Nast to the CIA. Now, in a challenge to UPS and FedEx, Amazon is building out a vast shipping and delivery operation with the aim of handling both its own packages and those of other companies.11 By controlling these essential pieces of infrastructure, Amazon can privilege its own products and services as they move through these pipelines, siphoning off the most lucrative currents of consumer demand for itself. And it can set the terms by which other companies have access to these pipelines, while also levying, through the fees it charges, a tax on their trade. In other words, it's moving us away from a democratic political economy, in which commerce takes place in open markets governed by public rules, and toward a future in which the exchange of goods occurs in a private arena governed by Amazon. It's a setup that inevitably transfers wealth to the few\u2014and with it, the power over such crucial questions as which books and ideas get published and promoted, who may ply a trade and on what terms, and whether given communities will succeed or fail.12 Amazon is 'something radically new in the history of American business,' New Yorker writer George Packer has observed. But it's not without antecedents. In the 19th century, men like Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller harnessed a disruptive new technology\u2014the railroad\u2014and used the control that it gave them over market access to weaken their industrial competitors and extort money from farmers and small businesses. Their actions sparked a broad movement against monopolies, which led, over the following decades, to the passage of a robust body of antitrust laws. The central purpose of these laws was to protect liberty and democracy from concentrated economic power, or what Franklin Roosevelt called 'industrial dictatorship.'13      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bezos_god_img.jpgThe\">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bezos_god_img.jpgThe</url> God of All Things: Major Amazon acquisitions and investments By the time Bezos set up his bookselling operation on the Internet, however, these laws were no longer being enforced in accordance with their original purpose. In the 1970s, an ideological revolution swept through the fields of law and economics. Led by the conservative legal scholar and former Nixon solicitor general Robert Bork, among others, this new school of thought dismissed concerns about the impact of monopolies on the rights of citizens and even on competition. Its proponents argued that antitrust law should be reduced to a single, narrow goal: maximizing efficiency. And efficiency, they insisted, was something that big, consolidated corporations could deliver better. These ideas were codified under Ronald Reagan, whose administration left the antitrust laws intact but altered the way that regulators interpreted and enforced them. These changes won support from an ascendant faction of liberals, who made efficiency more appealing by recasting it as the source of lower prices for consumers.14 'Antitrust laws have been largely reduced to a technical tool to keep prices low,' notes Lina Khan, director of legal policy at the Open Markets Institute. As a consequence, so long as Amazon has appeared to benefit consumers, it's been allowed to grow using tactics that would once have drawn antitrust scrutiny. Amazon has an extensive history, for example, of selling goods at a loss in order to wrest market share from competitors that lack the financial backing to sustain similar losses. Bezos, a former hedge-fund executive who has an unparalleled gift for selling his vision to Wall Street, has always been candid with investors about this strategy. In a letter to shareholders after the company went public in 1997, he wrote that he would prioritize 'long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability.' Over the next six years, investors barely winced as Amazon lost $3 billion selling books and other items below cost. The investment paid off: Bookstores shut down in droves, and today nearly half of all books, both print and digital, are sold by Amazon.15      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amazon-dominance_img.jpgAmazon\">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amazon-dominance_img.jpgAmazon</url> has also used below-cost selling to crush and absorb upstart competitors. In 2009, it acquired the popular shoe retailer Zappos after reportedly losing $150 million selling shoes below cost in order to force the rival company to the altar. Likewise, when Quidsi, the firm behind Diapers.com, emerged as a vigorous competitor, Amazon offered to buy it; when Quidsi's founders refused, Amazon slashed its diaper prices below cost. Bleeding red ink, Quidsi eventually agreed to Amazon's offer. Over time, this behavior has had a restraining effect: Start-ups intent on challenging Amazon are unlikely to find investors and so never get off the ground. 'When you are small, someone else that is bigger can always come along and take away what you have,' Bezos has said.16 Amazon's many tentacles provide it with novel ways to strong-arm suppliers. By leveraging the interplay between the different parts of its business\u2014retail, e-commerce, manufacturing\u2014it can amplify its market power over them. For instance, when Amazon began producing its own apparel two years ago, one aim was to erase the only real bargaining chip that fashion brands have: their ability to decline to sell to Amazon. Speaking at a fashion-industry event, Jeff Yurcisin, a vice president of Amazon Fashion, explained that uncooperative designers would now face knockoffs: 'When we see gaps, when certain brands have actually decided for their own reasons not to sell with us, our customer still wants a product like that.'17      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-cornering_img.jpgCornering\">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-cornering_img.jpgCornering</url> the Market: A comparative look at Amazon's market value Amazon's dominance has been aided by Bezos's prescient grasp of how the seemingly wide-open Web could be turned into a winner-take-all environment. In 2005, Amazon launched Prime, a membership program that provides free two-day shipping and other perks for $99 a year. As a stand-alone service, Prime is a money-loser; Forrester Research estimates that Amazon loses $1 billion a year on the shipping alone. The point of getting people to fork over $99 has never been about the money, though\u2014it's about the psychology. When people pay for Prime, they naturally want to maximize the value in free shipping they derive from it by doing more of their shopping on Amazon. Already, some 80 million Americans, accounting for more than half of the country's households, are Prime members. Studies show they are less likely to comparison-shop, and they spend almost twice as much with Amazon as non-Prime customers.18 With Alexa, Bezos has found a way to lure people even deeper into Amazon's ecosystem. Alexa is the voice assistant that powers the company's Echo speaker, and it makes buying from Amazon as effortless as a passing thought. 'The fact that it's always on, you never have to charge it, and it's there ready in your kitchen or your bedroom or wherever you put it, the fact that you can talk to it in a natural way\u2014removes a lot of barriers, a lot of friction,' Bezos has said of the speaker. One such friction is choice: If you ask Alexa for batteries, you won't get to choose Duracell or Energizer; Amazon's brand is the only option. With Alexa, Amazon will 'slowly but surely take control of your preferences,' predicts Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University. The digital giant has already sold at least 20 million of these devices.19 Although Amazon continues to earn relatively meager profits compared with rivals like Walmart and Apple, its stock price has soared, almost doubling in value over the past 18 months and making Bezos the wealthiest person in the world. Investors see where this is heading. In 2016, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and owner of the Golden State Warriors, put a name to it: Amazon, he told an audience of fellow investors, 'is a multitrillion-dollar monopoly hiding in plain sight.'20 What Amazon's giddy investors already understand, however, regulators have so far failed to grasp. Last June, Amazon announced its intention to buy Whole Foods. The deal gives Amazon a prominent foothold in the pivotal grocery industry and much else besides. With Whole Foods, Amazon gains new ways to cement its dominance online, including by extending its package-delivery infrastructure to 470 stores nestled among millions of urban consumers. And it allows the company to blur the distinction between online and offline retail, accelerating the spread of digitally driven commerce and, with it, Amazon's power. Yet, just two months after the deal was announced, the Federal Trade Commission gave it the green light, concluding that the merger did not warrant an in-depth review.21 As it grows, Amazon is exposing the deficiencies of the Reagan-era changes in how we think about corporate concentration. By collapsing antitrust enforcement to consider only prices, we have lost sight of what earlier generations knew about monopolies: that they can harm us as producers of value, not merely as consumers of it. And their control over our livelihoods and the fate of our communities is inherently political: It's a threat to liberty and democracy.22 Economists have recently begun to document a link between corporate concentration and rising inequality. Dominant companies, they're finding, are funneling the spoils to a small number of people at the top. And by reducing the number of their competitors, these companies are also making it harder for workers to get a fair wage and for producers to get a fair price. A particularly troubling data point in this research is the loss of a long-standing pathway to a middle-class life: starting a business. The number of new firms launched each year has fallen by nearly two-thirds since 1980, and many economists believe that corporate power is to blame. This lack of start-ups is fueling a broader decline in the ranks of small business: Between 2005 and 2015, the number of small retailers fell by 85,000, a drop of 21 percent relative to population.23 In this story of concentrated power and wealth, Amazon is a central character. In a 2016 survey, independent retailers ranked competition from Internet retailers like Amazon as the biggest threat to their businesses, more worrisome than big-box stores or rising health-insurance costs. And their decline is having ripple effects up the supply chain. As more of the market shifts to a single gatekeeper, manufacturers say they are having a harder time introducing new products. Local businesses 'are in a much better position as small retailers to do that boot-strapping,' says Michael Levins, the founder of Innovative Kids, a book and puzzle producer that's been in business for 29 years.24 At the same time that many communities are seeing local businesses disappear, they're also losing retail jobs. This past year, more people lost jobs in general-merchandise stores than the total number of workers in the coal industry. Even as Amazon expands its network of warehouses, it isn't creating enough jobs to make up for the losses it's causing. The basic math of what's under way is startling: Retail accounts for about one in 10 American jobs, and Amazon needs only half as many workers to distribute the same volume of goods as traditional stores require. Plus it's likely to need even fewer workers in the future: Since 2015, Amazon has invited elite engineering teams to compete in an annual robotics challenge. Their mission is to design a robot that can select and grasp assorted items, a task that, for now, only humans can do.25      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-sales_infographic_img.jpgOnward\">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-sales_infographic_img.jpgOnward</url>, Upward: Amazon's share of online retail sales in the United States This kind of wholesale upending of an industry happens periodically, and, as a rule, we don't run out of jobs. But today, in the absence of a flush of new businesses creating new opportunities, work for many people has become increasingly precarious\u2014and, in the case of Amazon workers, punishing. People who work inside the company's warehouses describe the pace as grueling, with 'unit-per-hour' rates set so high that failure and exhaustion are routine. Amazon's approach to work is at once futuristic and a throwback to labor's distant past. Robots zip around, laden with products, while many of the people they interface with are temporary employees. Amazon calls these workers 'seasonal,' but, in fact, it relies on them year-round.26 As it moves into package delivery, Amazon is bringing its labor model along, relying in part on Amazon Flex drivers, who use their own vehicles, take directions from an app, and are paid a piece rate for each batch of boxes they deliver. The impacts are already being felt at the US Postal Service and UPS, whose hundreds of thousands of unionized employees constitute one of the last surviving corners of the working middle class. A few months ago, over the objections of the Teamsters union, UPS began placing ads for drivers who will use their own vehicles.27 As a result of the economic shifts that Amazon is helping to propel, the country is being divided into a starkly unequal geography. Only a handful of metro areas are gaining significant numbers of good jobs from Big Tech. And as the formation of new businesses declines, they're also being consolidated into fewer places: In contrast with previous recoveries, when new firms were widely dispersed, half of all businesses started between 2010 and 2014 were located in just five metro areas. Even winning cities are marked by disparity: In Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, the median home value now exceeds $700,000, while the unsheltered homeless population doubled over 10 years. It's not hard to imagine a future in which Amazon's cashier-less supermarkets and nondescript bookstores populate better-off neighborhoods, while other communities become increasingly barren of commercial activity.28 In the left-behind towns and neighborhoods, the despair that has set in stems from more than just economic hardship. There is a pervasive sense of powerlessness that is toxic to democracy. In 1946, the sociologist C. Wright Mills and the economist Melville J. Ulmer published a detailed study of several matched pairs of cities. The cities in each pair were similar in all respects except for one main difference: One city's economy was composed of many locally owned firms, while the other's was largely controlled by absentee corporations. The cities that possessed a degree of local economic power had a bigger middle class and a greater variety of jobs, Mills and Ulmer found. But their most important findings had to do with civic health. The cities with a robust local economy invested more in public infrastructure and services, and their residents were involved in community affairs in greater numbers.29      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-Everything_img.jpgThe\">https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Amazon-Everything_img.jpgThe</url> Everything Store: The growing share of online shoppers who start their search on Amazon Today, using large-scale statistical techniques, sociologists have confirmed Mills and Ulmer's broad conclusions, finding, for example, that communities that possess more local economic power are better able to solve problems. But these ideas are no longer reflected in policy. Now, instead of actively seeking to disperse economic power, policy-makers encourage its concentration. Many elected officials are as enthralled with Bezos as his investors are, and they've been equally willing to fund Amazon's growth. Congress has repeatedly declined to pass legislation that would allow states to require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes. This allowed Amazon to largely avoid collecting sales taxes for nearly two decades, giving it a price advantage that research shows helped drive shoppers to its site. Then, as Amazon's warehouse expansion began to compel its compliance with sales taxes, the company started angling for local development incentives. It's raked in more than $1.1 billion through these deals, according to Good Jobs First, and more than half of the warehouses that Amazon built between 2005 and 2015 received public subsidies.30 Then, last fall, Amazon set off a frenzied bidding war to land its second headquarters. In the ensuing months, as the leaders of more than 200 cities groveled to attract the company's eye, they sent a clear message to their constituents: Amazon's widening reach is something to be wished for fervently. For Amazon, this public-relations windfall\u2014coming at the very moment when some are beginning to question its power, and propelled, in many cases, by leading progressive mayors\u2014may prove even more valuable than the subsidies that elected officials are offering. And those offers have been astonishingly large: Maryland is dangling $5 billion, along with close proximity to Congress. In New Jersey, meanwhile, Senator Cory Booker, former governor Chris Christie, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka put together an offer worth $7 billion. That's $2 billion more than Amazon says its new headquarters will cost.31 In June of 2016, Senator Elizabeth Warren gave a headline-grabbing speech calling for action to check monopoly power. She singled out several dominant companies, including Amazon, noting that 'the platform can become a tool to snuff out competition.' And she argued that we should use antitrust policy to break up concentrations of power and broaden opportunity, presenting a progressive economic vision that has more to offer people than simply an enhanced social safety net.32 In recent months, a growing number of political leaders have started to make the case for restoring antitrust policy to its former strength and purpose. The US House of Representatives now hosts the newly formed Antitrust Caucus. Its founders include Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), who, interestingly, hails from Silicon Valley, and who urged antitrust enforcers last summer to undertake a much more thorough review of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger than they did. Another member is Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), who's been outspoken about the destructive power of dominant tech platforms to manipulate consumers and impede start-ups. The caucus's first piece of legislation, which would require the antitrust agencies to retrospectively review the effects of mergers they have approved, has been introduced by Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN), who believes that 'massive monopolies are threatening our democracy.'33 Democrats aren't the only ones pushing for a more muscular approach to monopolies. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican and candidate for the US Senate, has launched an antitrust investigation of Google.34Monopoly's New Rules How might we use the tools of antitrust law to check Amazon's power? One approach would break the company into two pieces by spinning off its e-commerce platform from its retail operation, thereby eliminating the conflict inherent in controlling market access for one's competitors. We could then designate the resulting platform company as a common carrier, obligating it to offer all sellers access on equal terms, just as we did with the railroads. Alongside this, we need to once again police predatory pricing, the practice of selling goods below cost to drive out competition. Antitrust enforcers and the courts dismissed predatory pricing as a concern in the 1980s on the grounds that the tactic rarely succeeds. Amazon has shown otherwise.35 Amazon will undoubtedly respond to any effort to rein it in by making its dominance seem like the inevitable outcome of technological progress. When Bezos was asked several years ago about his company's effect on publishers and booksellers, he responded: 'Amazon is not happening to bookselling; the future is happening to bookselling.' Bezos would like us to believe that we shouldn't expect to enjoy the benefits of the digital revolution without surrendering our markets to Amazon's control. But history tells a different story: Federal antitrust cases against AT...IBM, and Microsoft all produced a surge of innovation and start-up activity in their wake.36 Back in Michigan, Lampen-Crowell is eager to compete. He's added a series of injury-prevention workshops to the calendar, along with a schedule of weekly runs with various goals, from improving speed to helping residents stay active during the state's long winters. The question now is whether we as citizens will insist that this business, and many others like it, have a fair chance to succeed.37 [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue\">https://www.thenation.com/issue</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy\">http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TNTN1032201518700710194251762100176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RN8-G4T1-JCMN-Y0WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4647\"/><timeReceived>1:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The full scope of Amazon's business relationship with the government is hard to track because there are more than a dozen resellers that agencies can also use to purchase its services.

Beutel left the government in January 2015. By April, his new firm was registered to lobby on behalf of Amazon Web Services - engaging \"with policymakers regarding cloud acquisition and deployment,\" according to one disclosure.</p><p>Bringing in people such as Beutel who have deep ties to the federal contracting process shows that Amazon's efforts to woo the government are maturing. But Leong said the company is still playing catch-up with its major competitor in the cloud IT space, Microsoft, which has a longer history in government contracting.</p><p>\"They do not have as many relationships, and we know that government contracting involves a lot of relationships. Microsoft, for instance, has very deep relationships on the federal and state level - they understand how this works,\" Leong said. \"Amazon is really having to learn how to navigate all these things.\"</p><p>The lobbying disclosures do not break down how much Amazon spent on each of the issues listed on the forms. And the company did not elaborate on which issues primarily drove the spending increase. But on some matters, such as drones, Amazon has made its interests clear.</p><p>It dreams of delivering packages to customers' doorsteps via unmanned aircraft, even though proposed Federal Aviation Administration rules for commercial drone use wouldn't allow for the type of flights the company hopes to make.</p><p>\"The FAA has a tough job - so I think we can acknowledge that right away,\" Bezos said when asked at the town hall about his experience working with the agency. \"What's happening with drones is going to cause a lot of new rules to be written, and they're going to have to be done very carefully.\"</p><p>While Bezos said that the agency has \"very good intentions,\" he also argued that its approach may be a little \"backward.\"</p><p>The FAA is \"a little strangely hamstrung because they have very little control over hobbyist drones and complete control over commercial drones,\" Bezos said. A company like Amazon, he argued, can bring a higher \"level of care and rigor\" to its drone projects than most hobbyists can.</p><p>The FAA has been slower than authorities in some of the other countries where Amazon is experimenting, Bezos said, citing \"forward thinking\" approaches in Canada, Britain and the Netherlands.</p><p>\"There are a number of jurisdictions where I suspect we'll see parcel delivery by drone first,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrea.peterson@washpost.com\">andrea.peterson@washpost.com</email></p><p>Alice Crites and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-f682f724cc3911e5ae1157b6aeab993f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1K-1SS1-JCDY-T43R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><timeReceived>3:52 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 6, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The jump puts Amazon in the same lobbying league as other tech giants such as Microsoft and Facebook - and reflects how the company's expanding business interests have raised the stakes of its relationship with the government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issues were wide-ranging and included some obvious ones such as online sales taxes and drones. But Amazon also pressed Washington on cloud services, cybersecurity and welfare benefits, among other matters.</p><p>The increased lobbying spending is just one sign of Amazon's interest in courting the nation's capital. In the fall of 2014, the company moved its Washington policy shop to a much larger office space. Last spring, Amazon picked up Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary.</p><p>\"Like a lot of businesses, Amazon has a presence in Washington, and we focus on issues that matter to us,\" said Carney, now Amazon's senior vice president for global corporate affairs.</p><p>Amazon has long lobbied for a national standard for collecting state sales taxes on online purchases, a change that would simplify its business practices.</p><p>In a recent town hall meeting with Washington Post employees, Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos - who also owns The Post - cited state sales taxes as the lobbying issue on which he has been personally most engaged. But so far, legislation at the heart of that change has been unsuccessful, much to Bezos's chagrin.</p><p>\"It's even a bipartisan issue that both sides agree on, and we still can't get it done,\" he said. \"It's very puzzling to me as an outsider. I don't know how you guys live here, honestly.\"</p><p>But Amazon's fastest-growing sector, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is far from an outsider in Washington. While most people probably know Amazon as an online retailer, its cloud-computing segment is quickly becoming a key pillar of its business. The subsidiary - which lets customers use Amazon's Web-based servers for their computing needs - has deals with big tech firms such as Netflix and Airbnb, as well as some parts of the federal government.</p><p>\"They are the primary cloud-infrastructure provider to government,\" said Lydia Leong, an analyst and vice president focused on information technologies at the research firm Gartner.</p><p>The company's cloud segment has done business with federal agencies including NASA, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Justice Department. The full scope of Amazon's business relationship with the government is hard to track because there are more than a dozen resellers that agencies can also use to purchase its services. But one agreement stands out: In 2013, the CIA awarded Amazon a contract worth up to $600 million to build and maintain a cloud system for U.S. intelligence agencies - over the objections of IBM, which had offered to do the job for a lower price.</p><p>\"The fact that AWS has had some success in its business with the public sector, and obviously with the CIA, speaks to the quality of what AWS has and offers,\" Carney said.</p><p>It's unclear how significant government contracting is to AWS's overall growth: The division had 70 percent year-on-year sales growth for total operating income of $1.86 billion in 2015, according to the company's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The cloud segment also has much thicker margins than other parts of the business and could soon eclipse profits from North American retail operations if it keeps growing at the same rate.</p><p>But the recent SEC filing warned that the company faces risks related to \"government contracts and related procurement regulations.\" And last year, Amazon retained the lobbying services of Richard Beutel, who previously served a senior staffer for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and was the original author of the last major law reforming federal IT policy. Beutel left the government in January 2015. By April, his new firm was registered to lobby on behalf of Amazon Web Services - engaging \"with policymakers regarding cloud acquisition and deployment,\" according to one disclosure.</p><p>Bringing in people such as Beutel who have deep ties to the federal contracting process shows that Amazon's efforts to woo the government are maturing. But Leong said the company is still playing catch-up with its major competitor in the cloud IT space, Microsoft, which has a longer history in government contracting.</p><p>\"They do not have as many relationships, and we know that government contracting involves a lot of relationships. Microsoft, for instance, has very deep relationships on the federal and state level - they understand how this works,\" Leong said. \"Amazon is really having to learn how to navigate all these things.\"</p><p>The lobbying disclosures do not break down how much Amazon spent on each of the issues listed on the forms.

But it also pressed Washington on other matters including computer cloud services, cybersecurity and welfare benefits.</p><p>The increased lobbying spending is just one sign of Amazon's interest in courting the nation's capital. In the fall of 2014, the company moved its Washington policy shop to a much larger office space. Last spring, Amazon picked up Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary.</p><p>\"Like a lot of businesses, Amazon has a presence in Washington and we focus on issues that matter to us,\" said Carney, now Amazon senior vice president for global corporate affairs.</p><p>Amazon has long lobbied for the creation of a national standard for collecting state sales tax for online purchases, a change that would simplify its business practices.</p><p>In a recent town hall meeting with Washington Post employees, Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos -- who also owns The Post -- cited state sales taxes as the lobbying issue he has been personally most engaged on. But so far, legislation at the heart of that change has been unsuccessful -- much to Bezos' chagrin.</p><p>\"It's even a bipartisan issue that both sides agree on and we still can't get it done,\" he said. \"It's very puzzling to me as an outsider. I don't know how you guys live here, honestly.\"</p><p>But Amazon's fastest-growing sector, Amazon Web Services, is far from an outsider in Washington. While most people probably know Amazon as an online retailer, its cloud computing segment is fast becoming a key pillar of its business. The subsidiary -- which lets customers use Amazon's Web-based servers for their computing needs -- has deals with big tech firms such as Netflix and Airbnb, as well as some parts of the federal government.</p><p>\"They are the primary cloud infrastructure provider to government,\" said Lydia Leong, a distinguished analyst and vice president focused on information technologies at research firm Gartner.</p><p>The company's cloud segment has done business with an alphabet soup of agencies including NASA, HHS, and DOJ. Even then, the full scope of Amazon's business relationship with the government is hard to track because there are more than a dozen resellers that agencies can also use to purchase its services. But one government agreement stands out: In 2013, Amazon was awarded a contract worth up to $600 million by the CIA to build and maintain a cloud system for America's intelligence agencies -- over the objections of IBM, which had offered to do the job for a lower price.</p><p>\"The fact that AWS has had some success in its business with the public sector, and obviously with the CIA, speaks to the quality of what AWS has and offers,\" said Carney.</p><p>It's unclear how significant government contracting is to AWS's overall growth: The cloud services division had 70 percent year on year sales growth for a total operating income of $1.86 billion in 2015, according to the company's latest SEC filing. The cloud segment also has much thicker margins than other parts of the business and could soon eclipse profits from North American retail operations if it keeps growing at the same rate.</p><p>But the recent SEC filing did warn that the company faces risks related to \"government contracts and related procurement regulations.\" And last year, the company also retained the lobbying services of Richard Beutel, who previously served a senior staffer for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and was the original author of the last major law reforming federal IT policy. Beutel left the government in January 2015. By April, his new firm was registered to lobbying on behalf of Amazon Web Services -- engaging \"with policymakers regarding cloud acquisition and deployment,\" according to one disclosure.</p><p>Bringing in people who have deep ties to the government contracting process like Beutel shows that Amazon's efforts to woo the government are maturing. But Leong said they're still playing catchup with their major competition in the cloud IT space, Microsoft, which has a longer history in government contracting.</p><p>\"They do not have as many relationships -- and we know that government contracting involves a lot of relationships. Microsoft, for instance, has very deep relationships on the federal and state level -- they understand how this works,\" said Leong. \"Amazon is really having to learn how to navigate all these things,\" she said.</p><p>The lobbying disclosures do not break down how much Amazon spent on each of the issues listed on the forms. And the company did not elaborate on which issues primarily drove the increase. But on some matters, such as drones, Amazon has made its interests clear.</p><p>Amazon dreams of delivering packages to customers doorsteps via unmanned aircraft, even though the proposed rules by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial drone use wouldn't allow for the type of flights the company hopes to make.</p><p>\"The FAA has a tough job -- so I think we can acknowledge that right away,\" Bezos said when asked about his experience working with the agency at the town hall. \"What's happening with drones is going to cause a lot of new rules to be written, and they're going to have to be done very carefully.\"</p><p>While Bezos said the agency has \"very good intentions,\" he also argued their approach perhaps may be a little \"backward.\"</p><p>The FAA is \"a little strangely hamstrung because they have very little control over hobbyist drones and complete control over commercial drones,\" Bezos said. A company like Amazon, he argued, can bring a higher \"level of care and rigor\" to its drone projects than most hobbyists.</p><p>The FAA has been slower than some of the other jurisdictions where Amazon is also experimenting, Bezos said, citing \"forward thinking\" approaches in Canada, the U.K. and the Netherlands.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-160205232882964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1D-SFD1-JC8C-24CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Sun-Sentinel Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</publicationName><edition>Palm Beach Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 6, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Enough to bolster sales at Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This spring, Amazon announced plans to make one-day shipping standard for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/technology/amazon-earnings-one-day-prime-shipping.html\">Amazon Prime</url> customers, a major logistics investment it said would cost $800 million in the second quarter alone. The growth of Amazon\u2019s core retail sales had been slowing, so investors hoped that offering millions more items available faster would get customers to spend more on its site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, the company said it had $63.4 billion in sales in its latest quarter, up 20 percent from the same period last year. Profit for the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 4 percent. Amazon beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for sales, but it fell short on earnings, as costs rose and Amazon\u2019s cloud computing business grew more slowly than in the past. Shares fell as much as 2 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said the costs for the rapid delivery were higher than he had anticipated. Productivity was \u201ca bit off\u201d in Amazon\u2019s vast fulfillment network as the company expanded its ability to ship more products in a day.</p><p>\u201cMillions more one-day packages went out this quarter than last,\u201d he said. \u201cCustomers are responding, and they like it.\u201d</p><p>[Get the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/TU\">Bits newsletter</url> for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]</p><p>Why was retail sales growth slowing?</p><p>People with a Prime membership, which costs $119 a year, are the company\u2019s biggest customers. They spend more than twice as much as non-Prime shoppers.</p><p>But with more than 100 million estimated Prime members in the United States, the growth is \u201creaching its limit,\u201d according to a June <url normalizedValue=\"https://files.constantcontact.com/150f9af2201/3c3f9cc6-84af-4ed7-a0fb-6055b43c85d3.pdf\">report</url> by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And as the rise in Prime memberships has slowed, so has Amazon\u2019s sales growth.</p><p>There are signs that delivery times could help juice sales. About a third of Prime members say they have abandoned purchases in their online shopping carts because an item would not arrive fast enough, according to research from John Blackledge, who covers Amazon for the investment bank Cowen.</p><p>Mr. Olsavsky said that as one-day shipping becomes available on more products, Amazon competes more on things people want quickly. \u201cIt strengthens your need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product,\u201d he said.</p><p>In the quarter that ended in March, the number of units sold on Amazon was up just 10 percent, compared with 22 percent growth during the same period a year earlier. This quarter, unit sales picked back up, growing 18 percent, far more than Wall Street had expected. Mr. Olsavksy said the company was still trying to understand how purchasing behavior was changing, noting that a lot of the new purchase growth came from lower-price items.</p><p>\u201cChanging Prime to one-day delivery is an epic move,\u201d Mr. Blackledge said.</p><p>The cloud keeps growing, but at a slower pace.</p><p>Amazon has several businesses that have begun to provide consistently large profits. The biggest component is Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider. It has continued to grow even as sales reached almost $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter, and it is more profitable than the much larger retail business.</p><p>But the annual growth for the cloud division did dip below 40 percent for the first time, and operating margin was down to 24 percent, versus 84 percent this time last year. Mr. Olsavksy attributed the smaller profit margin to spending heavily on sales and marketing. He said Amazon\u2019s tech work force is growing about twice as fast as the company\u2019s overall head count, which is up 13 percent.</p><p>Sales on the website are increasingly from third-party merchants, who pay Amazon fees for listing and shipping their items. That business as a fee collector is also more profitable for Amazon than when it sells items directly from its inventory.</p><p>Finally, Amazon\u2019s high-margin ad business reaches more than an estimated $10 billion a year in sales, as it has become almost a necessity for people selling on the website. Amazon has also been building out tools to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html\">use consumers\u2019 shopping behavior</url> to target them for ads across the web. Amazon\u2019s \u201cOther\u201d business segment, which it says is largely ads, had $3 billion in sales in the last quarter.</p><p>Those profit machines let Amazon spend heavily on the infrastructure for fast delivery or other major pushes that don\u2019t yet produce major revenue, like the Alexa voice assistant. \u201cThey have cover with this ad business scaling and A.W.S. as the incredible business it is,\u201d said Mr. Blackledge.</p><p>Has the scrutiny in Washington hurt the business?</p><p>The pressure in Washington has been ramping up, as lawmakers and regulators focus on antitrust concerns. Amazon had to testify before Congress last week, where an executive <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html\">was peppered with questions</url> about whether it misuses customer and seller data for its own benefit, and the Justice Department       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/technology/justice-department-tech-antitrust.html\">announced</url> this week that it was opening a sweeping antitrust review into big tech companies.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission had begun a formal antitrust investigation into the social network. The F.T.C. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html\">also has taken the lead</url> for antitrust oversight for Amazon.</p><p>Investors, so far, aren\u2019t worried. Michael Levine, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group, said the \u201crisk is remote\u201d that antitrust scrutiny will severely harm Amazon. In a research note, Wedbush Securities echoed that sentiment.</p><p>\u201cOn balance, we think that a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,\u201d the note read. \u201cIn order to change the laws, Congress would have to agree to change them, which we view as exceedingly unlikely.\u201d</p><p>In a call with reporters on Thursday, Mr. Olsavsky said the company did not comment on regulatory matters. He added that the company\u2019s expectations for the next quarter did \u201c not include any particular penalties or impact from regulations.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: An Amazon warehouse in Staten Island.

The company retains voice recordings indefinitely and, in some cases, holds onto their personal data even after users tried to delete it, according to the complaint.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those practices violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, said Josh Golin, executive director of the CCFC.</p><p>\"Given that Amazon has the money to pay the best corporate privacy attorneys that money can buy, it seems really strange that this was done in such a way that it does violate COPPA in so many ways,\" said Golin, who added that Amazon's system \"does feel like it was designed to confuse parents,\" rather than protect their children's privacy.</p><p>In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"FreeTime on Alexa and Echo Dot Kids Edition are compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.\" The company pointed customers to its Alexa website if they want more information.</p><p>U.S. Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who helped write COPPA, said in a letter to the FTC, joined by other senators, that the new findings raise \"serious concerns about the extent to which the Echo Dot Kids Edition complies\" with elements of the law.</p><p>The CCFC was among the groups critical of Amazon a year ago when the Seattle company first released a kid-focused variant of its popular Echo smart speaker line.</p><p>Encased in colourful rubber protectors, the hockey puck-sized devices come with Amazon's Alexa voice software and features like parental controls and advertising-free radio stations. Also included is a year of Amazon's FreeTime, a subscription service that offers a curated selection of kid-focused applications.</p><p>The devices, the CCFC contended last year, invaded kids' privacy and risked outsourcing elements of parenting to corporate-controlled software. Supported by a grant from the Rose Foundation, the Boston-based organization enlisted lawyers with Georgetown Law's Institute for Public Representation to probe Amazon's privacy practices.</p><p>To read more:Thousands of Amazon Workers Are Listening to What You Tell AlexaAmazon's Alexa Reviewers Can Access Customers' Home Addresses</p><p>The lawyers say they uncovered several potential violations of COPPA, which was passed two decades ago and restricts how companies can use data collected from kids younger than 13.</p><p>In the complaint, the groups say Amazon does not adequately verify that they have parental consent to begin collecting data and, afterward, provides inadequate disclosures on what personal information it collects and how Amazon and third parties use that data. Only 15% of the Alexa applications tailored for kids included a link to a privacy policy at all, the complaint says.</p><p>The advocates also argue that a privacy feature designed to let parents delete elements of kids' personal information did not seem to actually erase that knowledge from the software's memory.</p><p>Researchers tried deleting facts they'd previously asked Alexa to remember, as well as the software's entire history of voice recordings, only to find Alexa could still recite a child's phone number, address and other personal details on command. In their testing, the only way to actually erase all of the personal information scooped up about a specific child was to delete that child's profile entirely.</p><p>\"We tried multiple ways, multiple time periods, to delete things, but it comes back anyhow,\" said Angela Campbell, a professor of law and co-director of Georgetown Law's institute. \"There doesn't seem to be any way other than discontinuing the service to stop that.\"</p><p>Amazon says most kid-friendly skills, or Alexa applications, don't have privacy policies because they don't collect personal information. Skills associated with FreeTime, the company says, don't have access to or collect user's data.</p><p>The focus on Amazon is the latest effort by kids' advocacy groups to push the FTC to scrutinize the privacy behaviors of big technology firms. Similar complaints with the regulator in the last year targeted Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>The FTC, the main federal agency charged with enforcing privacy law, declined to comment on a complaint it hadn't received.</p><p>Musical.ly, the popular teen video app now known as TikTok, earlier this year agreed to pay $5.7 million to settle claims that it illegally collected children's personal information.</p><p>\"The FTC responds to pressure from Capitol Hill, and there is so much interest on Capitol Hill in regulating the big tech companies\" Golin said. \"We're hopeful that in this changed climate they will take these incredibly serious violations by Amazon seriously.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The data employees accessed reportedly allowed Amazon to single out which products had the best earning potential, how to price their private-label products, and what product features they should copy. Amazon has long insisted it doesn't use sellers' data, a claim it's reiterated[2] in testimony to Congress in response to multiple antitrust probes[3]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. Amazon employees say they have used data from third-party sellers to inform their production of competing products, bucking the company's long-standing claims to Congress and regulators that it doesn't. More than 20 former Amazon employees said they had collected and accessed individual sellers' information to figure out which products they should make under its private labels, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal[5]. One Amazon employee said it was \"standard operating procedure\" for workers to pull non-public data that could give the company insight on how to price items and which ones would give them the highest earning potential. These claims are in direct contrast with what Amazon has long insisted. </p><p>Amazon has consistently denied it engages in the practice of collecting data from third-party sellers, even in response to criticism from politicians[6] and investigations from antitrust regulators. In a hearing in front of Congress in July 2019, an Amazon executive denied[7] that the company used seller data to help favor its own products on the platform. In response to the story in the WSJ, Amazon told Business Insider the company has launched an internal investigation into the claims. \"We strictly prohibit our employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"While we don't believe these claims are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation.\" Amazon has responded to past criticism by emphasizing that its private-label brands make up only 1% of sales on the platform. However, former executives told the WSJ that they were told Amazon's private-label brands should make up 10% of retail sales by 2022. Amazon's private-label business includes more than 45 brands[8], including AmazonBasics, Amazon Collection, and Amazon Essentials. Currently, Amazon is fielding antitrust probes over its use of data not only from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission[9], but also from the European Union's competition commissioner[10]. Amazon dominates the e-commerce marketplace, and accounted for nearly 40% of online sales in the US in 2019, according to eMarketer[11].

(Nasdaq: RXT) were up almost 12 percent as of 11:56 a.m. EST Monday (Aug. 17) following a Reuters report indicating that Amazon (Nasdaq: AMAZ) may buy a stake in the company.   Rackspace sells customers access to its own cloud and also offers a service called RackConnect , which helps customers access clouds maintained by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, VMWare and Google Cloud.   Reuters reported that Amazon is considering buying a minority stake in Rackspace, but there is \u201cno certainty\u201d that a deal would be reached. Rackspace\u2019s majority owner is Apollo Global Management Inc.   Rackspace and Apollo declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.   In an SEC filing connected with its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this month, Rackspace listed net income of $102 million and revenue of $2.4 billion for the fiscal year that ended Dec. 31, 2019.   FinTech companies\u2019 growing interest is one of many factors driving demand for cloud computing, which is attracting new players such as Wasabi .   Cloud computing also has benefited significantly from the surge in employees working from home due to COVID-19.   Rackspace was founded in 1998 by three students from Trinity University and maintains its headquarters there. It claims to have 6,000 employees and customers in 120 countries.   Chief Executive Officer Kevin M. Jones joined Rackspace in April 2019, according to his official company biography.   In other Amazon news, it was reported on Monday (Aug. 17) that Amazon is being investigated by Germany\u2019s competition regulator for potential antitrust issues stemming from its relationship with third-party sellers.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS Live Roundtable: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 \u2013 12:00 PM (ET)     Card products are undergoing changes from form factor to digital-first spend controls to totally touchless capabilities and more. Big-spending demographics like Millennials and Gen-Z reward digital-first features that have demonstrable value, and research shows they will switch financial institutions to gain Big Tech connected economy experiences. Credit union innovation must stay one step ahead. PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster and expert guests debate the best ways to modernize card products and strategies for credit unions at a time of big economic resets and Big Tech incursions.

Data violations are drawing considerable financial penalties: In the U.S. for example, Facebook is reportedly negotiating a multibillion-dollar FTC fine related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In Europe, Alphabet was recently hit with a $57 million fine, the largest GDPR penalty since the regulation went into effect in 2018.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers are raising antitrust alarm bells. Recently, presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed a plan to break up Big Tech and  that made the companies so dominant. Warren has said that her proposal, which targets Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook and even Apple, would better protect consumers and restore competition in the marketplace. Meanwhile, state attorneys general are also banding together to take action on  .</p><p>Tech giants that operate marketplaces, including Amazon and Apple, are also increasingly held accountable for what critics say amounts to monopolistic behavior. Earlier in March, Spotify filed a lawsuit in Europe accusing Apple of  over competitors, such as Spotify. Apple is also facing a growing backlash to its App Store fees from major publishers like Netflix, and is involved in a class-action suit over the App Store that will be considered by the Supreme Court later this year.</p><p>Similarly, Amazon has been criticized for freezing out third-party merchants in its e-commerce marketplace. And suspicion towards the tech giant, which has its hands in cloud computing, groceries, health care, advertising, transportation and more -- came to the fore through its high-profile HQ2 search. Critics accused Amazon of fishing for billions in tax breaks, and it ultimately pulled out of New York City following the backlash.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

(FB) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) have about a 25% chance of facing some form of antitrust action in the next 12 to 18 months, by the estimates of Height Capital Markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We're at 25% and trending up,\" Height senior vice president of special situations Stefanie Miller said, suggesting that the Federal government or state Attorneys General are more likely to move than Congress.</p><p>While academics such as New York University Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway have called for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14717738/index.dl|breakup\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14717738/index.dl|breakup</url> of big tech, Miller and Height analyst Hunter Hammond suggested that behavioral fixes are more likely\u00a0 than breakups.</p><p>The government could impose data silos on Google and Facebook, they suggest. So, Google would not be able to share data between different platforms such as Google Adsense, Google Search, Waze, and YouTube to create comprehensive profiles that allow advertisers to target consumers with their digital ads. Google did not respond to a query.\u00a0 Facebook declined comment.</p><p>\"That's the step we'd look for,\" said Hammond.</p><p>\"Data siloing would be very negative for these companies that can build such a comprehensive profile on me,\" Miller said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon could have to provide more open access to its marketplace and web services to rivals. Amazon declined to comment on its antitrust outlook.</p><p>The \"hipster antitrust\" movement typified by scholars and regulators such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/|Lina\">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/|Lina</url> Khan, who joined the Federal Trade Commission this summer, could examine questions such as the value of data that consumers provide is worth more than the free services they receive from the social media networks.</p><p>\"The hipster point of view wants to look at competition more broadly or to reinvent how we define price and output,\" Hammond. Khan, for instance, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/amazons-antitrust-paradox|proposed\">https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/amazons-antitrust-paradox|proposed</url> treating Amazon akin to a telecom.\u00a0</p><p>Congress itself is less likely to act, Miller and Hammond suggest.  </p><p>Different constituencies have different concerns. Some focus on Russia's use of social networks and the impact on social networks, while for others\u00a0 data privacy or the sheers size of the tech companies. \"It's really hard for them to agree on what a policy should look like,\" Millers aid. Following Mark Zuckerberg's testimony on Capitol Hill in spring, she suggested, Wall Street doubts how much Congress grasps the issues at hand.</p><p>Zephyr Teachout's loss in the Democratic primary for New York Attorney General may auguer against a grass-roots groundswell of antitrust sentiment. Among other issues, the candidate had proposed a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/ny-metro-zephyr-teachout-monopoly-20180725-story.html|probe\">http://www.latimes.com/ny-metro-zephyr-teachout-monopoly-20180725-story.html|probe</url> of Facebook's and Google's power in digital advertising.</p><p>However, Miller noted a recent Pew Research <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/?source=techstories.org|survey\">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/?source=techstories.org|survey</url> that more Americans are deleting the Facebook app from their phones or at least taking a break from the social media network, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal over use of personal data by political campaigns.\u00a0</p><p>Upcoming events could provide signals about the intent of the Federal and state agencies.

The firms have submitted written evidence to a US government investigation into France's so-called digital services tax, in which they said the plans are \"unjustifiable.\" Donald Trump has warned France that if it proceeds with the tax reforms, he could hit back with his own measures \u2014 namely taxing the country's wine. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. America's biggest tech firms, including Amazon, Facebook, and Google, have come out swinging against sweeping tax reforms in France and the rest of Europe. </p><p>The French government last month passed plans to clobber tech companies with a 3% levy on their revenue, in addition to the more traditional method of taxing profit. The so-called digital services tax set alarm bells ringing at the US government, which almost immediately launched an investigation into the plans[2], known as a Section 301 investigation. President Donald Trump's administration was concerned that France was \"unfairly targeting the tax\" on US companies. The probe could culminate in retaliatory tariffs, which might open up a new trade war.

Some have submitted written statements in advance of the hearing[4], in which they bristle at the French proposals. Amazon, Facebook, and Google were among those to suggest that the tax was unfair. They said they would prefer to be subject to international reforms currently being considered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Here's what they said:Amazon[5]Peter Hiltz, Amazon's director of international tax policy and planning, said the digital services tax (DST) was \"discriminatory\" in that it will apply to a \"small number of almost entirely non-French companies\" because it only captures firms with revenues of \u20ac750 million ($840 million) or more. \"The DST is also particularly harmful because it is a tax on gross revenue and not profit, which will result in double taxation,\" he said, adding that it would have to pass on extra costs to French third-party sellers on its platform. \"The imposition of the French DST will result in a substantial expense that Amazon cannot absorb if we are to continue making the significant investments in the tools and infrastructure that help fuel our selling partners' success.\"Facebook[6]Facebook's head of global tax policy Alan Lee said the firm \"strongly\" supports the US government's decision to investigate the plans in France. He complained that it will be complicated for Facebook to comply with the new laws. \"This will impose a significant burden on Facebook, as there is little guidance on calculating this new type of tax, and our current systems would require a reengineering of our internal systems to capture this data in a way that fully complies with the law as written,\" he said.Google[7]\"The DST is likely to harm a wide range of American and other global businesses that use digital services and ads to reach French consumers,\" said Nicholas Bramble, Google's trade policy counsel. He noted that France is not alone in proposing a tech tax, with similar plans currently being put into law in the UK, while other countries \u2014 including Spain and New Zealand \u2014 consider following suit. \"A series of cascading unilateral measures would have dangerous repercussions for the OECD's multilateral process and for a wide range of US export sectors,\" Bramble explained. \"This is a concern for international trade and the wider economy if countries follow the DST model and select specific sectors and groups of foreign companies for targeted tax policies.\"Airbnb, Expedia, Microsoft, Salesforce, Stripe, and Twitter[8]These six firms, as well as Amazon, Facebook, and Google, banded together to submit joint testimony to Lighthizer's investigation. \"The French tax is unjustifiable in that it infringes international agreements, and unreasonable in that it is discriminatory, retroactive and inconsistent with international tax policy principles,\" the tech firms said. \"If the French DST goes unchallenged, it will provide political cover for a dozen or so countries considering similar measures.\"Trump has warned France that if it proceeds with the tax reforms, he could hit back with his own measures \u2014 namely taxing the country's wine. \"They shouldn't have done this,\" Trump told reporters last month[9]. \"I told them, I said, 'Don't do it because if you do it, I'm going to tax your wine.'\" France's finance minister, Bruno le Maire, has said the tax is about \"justice.\" He explained: \"These digital giants use our personal data, make huge profits out of these data then transfer the money somewhere else without paying their fair amount of taxes.\"NOW WATCH: I cleaned my entire apartment with 4 of Amazon's highest-rated cleaning

The Phoenix-based owner of a shoe-and-leather store wrote in a local newspaper he was \"amazed and a little dumbfounded\" by regulators' campaign to \"change how digital platforms operate.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The current system is working for small businesses, and as the old saying goes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" he wrote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Espinoza's words, published in September by the Arizona Capitol Times, weren't entirely his own. They were written on his behalf by an advocacy group that's backed by Google and other tech behemoths, reflecting Silicon Valley's stealthy new attempts to shape and weaponize public perception in response to heightened antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Under the withering microscope of government watchdogs, tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google have funded a bevy of political groups that have helped push positive polling and engaged in other fingerprint-free tactics designed to deter regulators who are seeking to break up or penalize the industry. The approach reflects the growing threats they now face from the Justice Department and the country's top attorneys general, who have been investigating them on antitrust grounds.</p><p>The Connected Commerce Council, for example, is a Washington-based nonprofit that bills itself as a voice for small businesses. But it counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as \"partners,\" and in recent months the group known as 3C has put its muscle to work arguing that Silicon Valley giants do not threaten competition, stifle smaller rivals and harm consumers in the process.</p><p>Espinoza, a bootmaker by profession, said he was approached by 3C last year after he participated in a Google seminar meant to help small businesses better use digital tools. The advocacy group then wrote the opinion piece largely on his behalf, which appeared online just days after state attorneys general announced their antitrust probe of the company. The opinion piece did not indicate that 3C largely penned it.</p><p>Espinoza said he still supported Google, whose technology, including its ad tools now under government investigation, has helped his company reach new customers across the country. But he also said he didn't know about Google's relationship with 3C, a group of which he is a member, before being contacted by The Post this week.</p><p>\"I'm not surprised,\" Espinoza said. Google is \"a big company ... and they have the finances to extend themselves as much as they can.\"</p><p>Jake Ward, the president of 3C, said his organization represents thousands of small businesses, not Silicon Valley's largest players. The organization often seeks to encourage corporate founders to share their views publicly, he added.</p><p>\"It is our responsibility, on behalf of our small-business members, to protect the existing model and promote the market, which is working exceedingly well,\" Ward said, later adding: \"We are not, and will not work for, Big Tech.\"</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Julie Tarallo McAlister, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement that the company supports \"a range of organizations like the Connected Commerce Council that are working to help small businesses grow and prosper online.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley tech giants - and companies across a range of industries - often back a wide array of advocacy groups to boost their political fortunes. They aren't required to disclose how much they spend on these organizations and exactly how involved they are in their day-to-day decisions, but ethics watchdogs say their participation alone is important.</p><p>\"It is an example of industry spending money and exerting influence, but doing it in a way that is meant to give the impression that it is not coming from industry,\" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group.</p><p>Bookbinder added: \"They wouldn't be members if they didn't agree with the thrust of what these organizations are pushing for.\"</p><p>The tech industry's attempts to shore up its public image in recent months reflect the seriousness of the U.S. government's new antitrust scrutiny. After years of threats, state and federal leaders have embarked on the kind of inquiries that could result in dramatic changes to the way Amazon, Facebook and Google operate, including punishments that could break apart those companies.</p><p>With Amazon, regulators are concerned that the e-commerce giant improperly gleans data from third-party sellers in an attempt to give its own products and services an advantage. In looking at Facebook, government officials have probed complaints it has gobbled up its digital rivals, leaving few viable competitors in social networking. And watchdogs have probed Google's search, advertising and smartphone businesses to determine whether they've stifled competition, following in the footsteps of European regulators who have already penalized the company.</p><p>All three tech giants deny they have violated state and federal antitrust rules. Still, Justice Department officials are expected to file a lawsuit against Google alleging it violated federal competition laws as soon as this month. Nearly every state's attorney general, meanwhile, could follow with their own complaint in July, The Post previously reported. The antitrust lawsuits come roughly seven years after U.S. officials first probed Google for violating competition law but ultimately decided against bringing a case in court.</p><p>With legal action imminent - and President Trump recently taking fresh, aggressive aim at Silicon Valley - the industry's largest companies have shelled out sizable sums to lobby in Washington. Amazon, Facebook and Google have spent more than $11 million combined over the first three months of 2020 to influence federal action on a range of issues, including antitrust, according to ethics disclosures filed with Congress. The amount is slightly higher than the same period in 2019.</p><p>But those figures do not reflect the hard-to-track sums spent by the industry to shape public opinion beyond the Beltway. Many in the tech industry privately say they've adopted such tactics because they face an onslaught of criticism from a wide array of new opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Accountability,  a nonprofit that has produced research critical of tech companies including Amazon and Google.</p><p>The group does not list its current backers, and it declined to detail them fully Tuesday. In the past it has courted Google's critics, including Oracle, though the campaign maintains it is not taking corporate contributions.</p><p>Facebook, for example, already has invested in a forthcoming advocacy group known as American Edge. The organization shares a similar structure to organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which blitzes airwaves with ads and doesn't have to disclose its donors.</p><p>The new tech group has sought to enlist support from other tech companies, including Amazon and Google, according to two people familiar with the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. It is not clear whether either company intends to join. The Post first reported last month on the group's imminent plans for launch.</p><p>The tech industry also has sought to funnel dollars to a wide array of conservative groups in recent years, hoping to earn more favor among Republicans in power at the White House and in Congress. That includes the National Taxpayers Union, a right-leaning outfit that typically targets government spending it sees as wasteful.</p><p>Last month, the NTU tapped a firm that previously polled for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to gauge voter sentiment about big tech. They focused their efforts on Arizona, Texas and other states that are actively investigating Google and other companies, and their findings concluded that voters would rather see their attorneys general focusing on other issues, including the opioid epidemic.</p><p>The survey explicitly asked if states should punish companies including Amazon and Google, which publicly have acknowledged their past financial support of the NTU. Pete Sepp, the president of the organization, declined to discuss the NTU's donors or the exact reasons it commissioned the poll, though he stressed that he and his organization have worked on competition-related issues for decades.</p><p>\"We have a huge historical footprint in the antitrust issue space that transcends any tech firm and goes well before their founding,\" he said.</p><p>Such research - seeking to channel public sentiment - is a battle-tested tactic in antitrust probes, former regulators say. It's meant to \"press upon public officials, and indirectly upon agencies, that [companies] enjoy broad public support for what they're doing,\" said William Kovacic, a top professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the Federal Trade Commission. \"To tamper with them in a significant way is to anger the broader public.\"</p><p>Two years ago, the Connected Commerce Council launched as a voice for small businesses, and Ward, its leader, has grown the organization into an operation that represents more than 10,000 entrepreneurs. The group provides technical support, helping owners and employees use tech tools to place ads, manage their checkbooks and reach new customers online, he said.</p><p>The goal was to connect these smaller operators to larger companies, according to Ward, who found that \"policy and politics collided pretty quickly on what I was trying to do.\" In the end, he has found himself defending Amazon, Facebook and Google because it's better for the start-ups 3C represents, he said.</p><p>By September 2018, 3C members had sounded off in support of major tech companies during a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Trade Commission. 3C also helped produce opinion pieces, including the one published by Espinoza in 2019. Ward said the work is critical because regulators and readers otherwise never would hear from small businesses.</p><p>In more recent months, 3C has amped up its letter-writing campaigns, dispatching missives targeting Texas and other states now investigating large technology companies. Its letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in May, signed by 200 members, even said the state should not penalize Big Tech amid the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>\"During a pandemic, when many storefronts are shuttered and businesses that are still running are operating entirely online, it is the wrong time to demand changes in digital technology operations and business models,\" they said.</p><p>In doing so, however, Ward has stressed his organization's independence. \"We don't lobby on their behalf,\" he said. \"And we're not advocates for their larger positions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8bbbb6fc8a264eba9ea819bcbfae7bc2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603M-B571-DXKP-J36R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1793\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The approach reflects the growing threats they now face from the Justice Department and the country's top attorneys general, who have been investigating them on antitrust grounds. The Connected Commerce Council, for example, is a Washington-based nonprofit that bills itself as a voice for small businesses. But it counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as \"partners,\" and in recent months the group known as 3C has put its muscle to work arguing that Silicon Valley giants do not threaten competition, stifle smaller rivals and harm consumers in the process. Espinoza, a boot-maker by profession, said he was approached by 3C last year after he participated in a Google seminar meant to help small businesses better use digital tools. The advocacy group then wrote the opinion piece largely on his behalf, which appeared online just days after state attorneys general announced their antitrust probe of the company. The opinion piece did not indicate that 3C largely penned it. Espinoza said he still supported Google, whose technology, including its ad tools now under government investigation, have helped his company reach new customers across the country. But he also said he didn't know about Google's relationship with 3C, a group of which he is a member, before being contacted by The Post this week. \"I'm not surprised,\" Espinoza said. Google is \"a big company ... and they have the finances to extend themselves as much as they can.\" Jake Ward, the president of 3C, said his organization represents thousands of small businesses, not Silicon Valley's largest players. The organization often seeks to encourage corporate founders to share their views publicly, he added. \"It is our responsibility, on behalf of our small business members, to protect the existing model and promote the market, which is working exceedingly well,\" Ward said, later adding: \"We are not, and will not work for, Big Tech.\" Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Julie Tarallo McAlister, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement that the company supports \"a range of organizations like the Connected Commerce Council that are working to help small businesses grow and prosper online.\" Silicon Valley tech giants \u2014 and companies across a range of industries \u2014 often back a wide array of advocacy groups to boost their political fortunes. They aren't required to disclose how much they spend on these organizations and exactly how involved they are in their day-to-day decisions, but ethics watchdogs say their participation alone is important. \"It is an example of industry spending money and exerting influence, but doing it in a way that is meant to give the impression that it is not coming from industry,\" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. Bookbinder added: \"They wouldn't be members if they didn't agree with the thrust of what these organizations are pushing for.\" The tech industry's attempts to shore up its public image in recent months reflects the seriousness of the U.S. government's new antitrust scrutiny. After years of threats, state and federal leaders have embarked on the kind of inquiries that could result in dramatic changes to the way Amazon, Facebook and Google operate, including punishments that could break apart those companies. With Amazon, regulators are concerned that the e-commerce giant improperly gleans data from third-party sellers in an attempt to give its own products and services an advantage. In looking at Facebook, government officials have probed complaints it has gobbled up its digital rivals, leaving few viable competitors in social networking. And watchdogs have probed Google's search, advertising and smartphone businesses to determine whether they've stifled competition, following in the footsteps of European regulators who have already penalized the company. All three tech giants deny they have violated state and federal antitrust rules. Still, Justice Department officials are expected to file a lawsuit against Google alleging it violated federal competition laws as soon as this month. Nearly every state's attorney general, meanwhile, could follow with their own complaint in July, The Post previously reported. The antitrust lawsuits come roughly seven years after U.S. officials first probed Google for violating competition law but ultimately decided against bringing a case in court. With legal action imminent \u2014 and President Donald Trump recently taking fresh, aggressive aim at Silicon Valley \u2014 the industry's largest companies have shelled out sizable sums to lobby in Washington. Amazon, Facebook and Google have spent more than $11 million combined over the first three months of 2020 to influence federal action on a range of issues, including antitrust, according to ethics disclosures filed with Congress. The amount is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. But those figures do not reflect the hard-to-track sums spent by the industry to shape public opinion beyond the Beltway. Many in the tech industry privately say they've adopted such tactics because they face an onslaught of criticism from a wide array of new opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit that has produced research critical of tech companies including Amazon and Google. The group does not list its current backers, and it declined to detail them fully Tuesday. In the past it has courted Google's critics, including Oracle, though the campaign maintains it is not taking corporate contributions. Facebook, for example, already has invested in a forthcoming advocacy group known as American Edge. The organization shares a similar structure to organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which blitzes airwaves with ads and doesn't have to disclose its donors. The new tech group has sought to enlist support from other tech companies including Amazon and Google, according to two people familiar with the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. It is not clear whether either company intends to join. The Post first reported last month on the group's imminent plans for launch. The tech industry also has sought to funnel dollars to a wide array of conservative groups in recent years, hoping to earn more favor among Republicans in power at the White House and in Congress. That includes the National Taxpayers Union, a right-leaning outfit that typically targets government spending it sees as wasteful. Last month, the NTU tapped a firm that previously polled for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to gauge voter sentiment about big tech. They focused their efforts on Arizona, Texas and other states that are actively investigating Google and other companies, and their findings concluded that voters would rather see their attorneys general focusing on other issues, including the opioid epidemic. The survey explicitly asked if states should punish companies including Amazon and Google, which publicly have acknowledged their past financial support of the NTU. Pete Sepp, the president of the organization, declined to discuss the NTU's donors or the exact reasons it commissioned the poll, though he stressed that he and his organization have worked on competition-related issues for decades. \"We have huge historical footprint in the antitrust issue space that transcends any tech firm and goes well before their founding,\" he said. Such research \u2014 seeking to channel public sentiment \u2014 is a battle-tested tactic in antitrust probes, former regulators say. It's meant to \"press upon public officials, and indirectly upon agencies, that [companies] enjoy broad public support for what they're doing,\" said William Kovacic, a top professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the Federal Trade Commission. \"To tamper with them in a significant way is to anger the broader public.\" Two years ago, the Connected Commerce Council launched as a voice for small businesses, and Ward, its leader, has grown the organization into an operation that represents more than 10,000 entrepreneurs. The group provides technical support, helping owners and employees use tech tools to place ads, manage their checkbooks and reach new customers online, he said. The goal was to connect these smaller operators to larger companies, according to Ward, who found that \"policy and politics collided pretty quickly on what I was trying to do.\" In the end, he has found himself defending Amazon, Facebook and Google because it's better for the start-ups 3C represents, he said. By September 2018, 3C members had sounded off in support of major tech companies during a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Trade Commission. 3C also helped produce opinion pieces, including the one published by Espinoza in 2019. Ward said the work is critical because regulators and readers otherwise never would hear from small businesses. In more recent months, 3C has amped up its letter-writing campaigns, dispatching missives targeting Texas and other states now investigating large technology companies. Its letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in May, signed by 200 members, even said the state should not penalize Big Tech amid the coronavirus crisis. \"During a pandemic, when many storefronts are shuttered and businesses that are still running are operating entirely online, it is the wrong time to demand changes in digital technology operations and business models,\" they said. In doing so, however, Ward has stressed his organization's independence. \"We don't lobby on their behalf,\" he said. \"And we're not advocates for their larger positions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS This photo combo of images shows the Amazon, Google and Facebook logos.

Google is the gateway to the internet and owns the most widely used operating system in mobile; Facebook is the conglomerate by which much of the world's inhabitants receive or share information, and Apple controls about a quarter of the smartphone market and a tenth of the computers.<br/>This will be the most important audience for the tech sector since the U.S. government tried to chop Microsoft for its dominant position two decades ago and brings the echoes of when in the 1990s the big tobacco companies sat down to answer about tobacco addiction and the industry was reformed forever.<br/>m{933665}<br/>Congressmen's questions could focus not only on free competition, but also on labor practices, privacy, electoral influence and misinformation, national security and international trade.<br/>U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning this morning, especially in the realm of social media, by ordering the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the telecoms regulator, to clarify \"whether social media platforms can editorialize user expression.\"<br/>Commerce asked the FCC to examine whether content \"healing\" is done in \"good faith\" and called for transparency in moderation practices.<br/>m{933663}\"The president will continue to fight against online censorship of unjust, anti-American and politically biased Americans,\" the White House said.<br/>Trump has declared war on social media, especially Twitter, since twitter, marking some of his tweets with warnings for disclosing false information about the election, something that violates the rules of use of the platform.<br/>Facebook has been more cautious in curbing content disclosed by Trump on its platform that could violate its rules of use.<br/>The sword Trump hangs over the heads of digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter or Youtube is section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which states that a social network cannot be treated as an \"editor.\"<br/>m{933668}<br/>In any case, the audience, in addition to being complex, promises to be unpredictable and complicated for congressmen who in the past have shown difficulties in understanding the technical background of some of the services provided by \"Big Tech\" and that have before them the best connected people and who invest more money in influencing Washington.<br/>?

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices.</p><p>They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.</p><p>The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.

Fending off accusat...</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple answered for their companies' practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.   Fending off accusations of stifling competition, four Big Tech CEOs - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple - are answering for their companies' practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.  The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers on Wednesday.  The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices.  They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.  The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.  Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.  Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.  Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.  \"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"  Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.  But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.  Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.  As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.  In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.  \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.  Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.  Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.  The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.  Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.  In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.  A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.  Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.  Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \"these giants stand to profit\" and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.  The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs.

We are trying to make sure that we get the full picture.\"<br/>Seattle-based Amazon declined to comment. Half of all items sold on its site globally come from small- and medium-sized businesses. Last year, third party sellers in Britain sold more than 2.3 billion pounds ($3.03 billion) worth of products outside the country while in Germany, they sold 2.1 billion euros ($2.45 billion) outside Germany.<br/>  Vestager has the power to fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules.<br/>  This probe is the latest move by the European Union to subject big tech companies to increasing scrutiny, amid worries that they are becoming too dominant.<br/>Amazon has been the target of previous EU investigations. Last year, officials ordered it to pay $295 million in back taxes to Luxembourg after finding that the company profited from a tax avoidance deal with the tiny European country. EU officials also investigated Amazon's e-book business, which was resolved last year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10669326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9H-20N1-JBYT-H34X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 20, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Investigators plan to look at whether Amazon's sway over third-party sellers prevents them from offering products on competing marketplaces, among other issues.  It comes as Amazon faces antitrust probes in the U.S. and in Europe.   Canada's Competition Bureau announced Friday it is launching an investigation into whether  Amazon 's conduct on its marketplace has hurt consumers and companies that do business in the country.    The antitrust watchdog said its investigation is ongoing and \"there is no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time.\" The bureau encouraged sellers and businesses to share information with investigators who are zeroing in on whether Amazon Canada is abusing its dominance in the market.   An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We are cooperating with the Competition Bureau's review and continue to work hard to support small and medium sized businesses who sell in our Canadian store \u2014 and help them grow.\"   The bureau said it would examine any Amazon policies that may impact third-party sellers' willingness to sell their products on competing online marketplaces or their own websites, as well as whether merchants can operate a successful business on the marketplace without using Amazon's fulfillment or advertising services.It will also look at any ways in which Amazon may influence consumer shopping habits over third-party sellers who sell competing products.   Many of the issues being looked at by the bureau are also top of mind for regulators in the U.S. and in Europe. Amazon reportedly faces an antitrust probe by attorneys general in New York and California, as well as an FTC investigation into its business practices in retail and cloud computing.   The Department of Justice and the House Judiciary Committee have both opened broad antitrust reviews of Big Tech, with the House Judiciary Committee expected to produce a report on its yearlong investigation into Amazon and other tech giants in the coming months.   The European Union's antitrust watchdog is also reportedly planning to file charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party sellers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42838336210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KM-HH51-JCSC-J464-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;
