Then, as if to say \"yes, we agree with this assessment\", Facebook quietly dropped another public relations bombshell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In what looked like an attempt to bury bad news late on a Friday afternoon in the US, Facebook said it was suing South Korean app developer Rankware over mishandling of user data. It hasn't said how many users might have been affected by this apparent privacy breach.</p><p>But Facebook doesn't get the benefit of the doubt any more, and comparisons to the Cambridge Analytica debacle of 2018, which affected tens of millions of users, are already being made.</p><p>Chris Hughes, who made a fortune from his involvement in Facebook, earlier in the week used an opinion piece in The New York Times to call for the company he helped found be forced to divest its holdings of photo sharing site Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp.</p><p>Zuckerberg spent vast sums of money buying Instagram ($US1 billion in 2012) and WhatsApp ($US19 billion in 2014) before either was generating revenue, let alone profit. Perception of the merits of those deals has changed over time: first they were viewed as extremely risky moves taken by a young CEO; then, as Facebook's share price continued its meteoric rise and its rivals withered, they were seen as acts of corporate genius.</p><p>Increasingly, though, they are viewed as deeply problematic deals that eliminated potential competitors to Facebook and cemented its dominance in social communications to the detriment of broader society.</p><p>In its December report into digital platforms, the Australian competition regulator described Instagram as \"the closest substitute to Facebook in both functionality and the size of its network\" and questioned whether Facebook should have been allowed to buy it.</p><p>\"With the benefit of hindsight, a view could be taken that this acquisition should not have been cleared or should have been subject to closer scrutiny,\" it said.</p><p>Last year, many users who attempted to quit Facebook in the aftermath of its myriad scandals, migrated straight across to Instagram without realising Facebook owns that platform, too. If not, (and as some users drift from public social networks to private messaging groups) there's a strong chance they use WhatsApp instead.</p><p>\"In the end people did not leave the company's platforms en masse,\" Hughes laments in his op-ed, referencing the utter failure of the #DeleteFacebook movement that sprung up last year, \"After all, where would they go?\"</p><p>The case for breaking up Facebook may be strong, but actually making it happen is far easier said than done.</p><p>Hughes has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook to be dismantled. They include US senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are both candidates for the Democratic Party's nomination in next year's presidential elections.</p><p>The ACCC wants powers to scrutinise future strategic acquisitions by Facebook (and Google). But, while this proposal has a lot of merit, it wouldn't do anything to force Facebook to divest Instagram or WhatsApp.</p><p>And the horse may have already bolted: there may not be any future acquisitions for the ACCC to review. For instance, Facebook did not need to buy Snapchat to ape its \"stories\" video format, which has become a highly popular feature of both the main blue app and Instagram. US competition laws view corporate activity through the narrow lens of the impact on consumers, as measured through prices.</p><p>Instagram and WhatsApp are free services, so from the perspective of US regulators at the time, there was nothing to see here. Warren's plan relies on employing tougher regulators, but also the passage of new legislation that would reclassify big tech companies as \"platform utilities\", which would not allow them to own competing services.</p><p>There are signs of support among Republicans for more regulation of tech companies, but getting new laws through America's bitterly dividend and at times completely insane Congress is no easy feat these days. And that's before the inevitable court challenges that will follow any break-up attempts that are even considered. Any attempt to get Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp will require a lot of political resolve, and global co-ordination - two qualities that are not in abundance.</p><p>As users will attest, breaking up with Facebook is hard, but not impossible. Regulators and lawmakers might find dismantling Facebook is a similar challenge.</p><p>The revelation that Foxtel had to rely on a $300 million loan from its biggest shareholder News Corp to cover debts maturing in April is a worrying sign for the pay TV platform.</p><p>The fact that Telstra, 35 per cent shareholder in Foxtel, did not tip any money in, is also highly significant.</p><p>News and Telstra have long clashed over Foxtel and it is clear the telco wants out. The problem is, Foxtel's apparent inability to raise debt on the open market suggests it is not in any position to be sold.</p><p>Foxtel's new streaming service KayoSports is growing solidly. But long-term questions about the product remain: can it grow big enough to offset the declines in Foxtel's traditional (and much more expensive) pay TV products? And if so, how quickly?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc75be7e3scva18u0kul2m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3D-8751-JD34-V019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

The chiefs of Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and Google faced an array of silly questions at a Washington, D.C. hearing on Wednesday, but also encountered pointed examples of their firms throwing their weight around and squashing competitors. Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai have some self-examination to do.   Forcing tech bosses to answer questions about their market power before the House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, albeit remotely, was bound to be political theater. Republicans spent most of their time accusing Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google of censorship of conservative views. One congressman wanted to know why his campaign emails were ending up in his parents\u2019 Gmail spam filters.   But there were questions that made the tech moguls squirm. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler cited emails where Zuckerberg describes how buying new competitors, like the purchase of Instagram in 2012, buys Facebook time. In a 2012 note posted by the Verge, the social network\u2019s founder said \u201cInstagram can hurt us.\u201d Instagram executives were worried that if they didn\u2019t sell, Facebook would go into \u201cdestroy mode.\u201d   Bezos also faced uncomfortable questions about Amazon\u2019s 2010 acquisition of Quidsi, which ran Diapers.com. A congresswoman referred to documents that showed Amazon was willing to lose $200 million a month before the acquisition by undercutting prices on Diapers.com, which it saw as a threat in that product category. The committee has been investigating Big Tech for a year; it looks like the time hasn\u2019t been wasted.   Regulators gave these acquisitions a free pass at the time, but they might not do so again. Each of the four that appeared in front of Congress is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department. Demands could range from behavioral curbs to, at worst, a breakup.

At times, the tech chiefs seemed caught by surprise by the questions they faced on Wednesday. Bezos claimed at one point that he couldn\u2019t recall particulars over the Diapers.com saga.

The chiefs of Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and Google faced an array of silly questions at a Washington, D.C. hearing on Wednesday, but also encountered pointed examples of their firms throwing their weight around and squashing competitors. Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai have some self-examination to do.   Forcing tech bosses to answer questions about their market power before the House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, albeit remotely, was bound to be political theater. Republicans spent most of their time accusing Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google of censorship of conservative views. One congressman wanted to know why his campaign emails were ending up in his parents\u2019 Gmail spam filters.   But there were questions that made the tech moguls squirm. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler cited emails where Zuckerberg describes how buying new competitors, like the purchase of Instagram in 2012, buys Facebook time. In a 2012 note posted by the Verge, the social network\u2019s founder said \u201cInstagram can hurt us.\u201d Instagram executives were worried that if they didn\u2019t sell, Facebook would go into \u201cdestroy mode.\u201d   Bezos also faced uncomfortable questions about Amazon\u2019s 2010 acquisition of Quidsi, which ran Diapers.com. A congresswoman referred to documents that showed Amazon was willing to lose $200 million a month before the acquisition by undercutting prices on Diapers.com, which it saw as a threat in that product category. The committee has been investigating Big Tech for a year; it looks like the time hasn\u2019t been wasted.   Regulators gave these acquisitions a free pass at the time, but they might not do so again. Each of the four that appeared in front of Congress is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department. Demands could range from behavioral curbs to, at worst, a breakup. There are also several bills in Congress to strengthen antitrust laws, and the subcommittee will eventually produce a report on the evidence it has collected.   At times, the tech chiefs seemed caught by surprise by the questions they faced on Wednesday. Bezos claimed at one point that he couldn\u2019t recall particulars over the Diapers.com saga. That suggests it\u2019s time the foursome took a walk down memory lane before the next phase of the tech backlash begins.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716144607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-11X1-F07F-80JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000CUVE</classCode><className>QUIDSI INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The chiefs of Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and Google faced an array of silly questions at a Washington, D.C. hearing on Wednesday, but also encountered pointed examples of their firms throwing their weight around and squashing competitors. Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai have some self-examination to do.   Forcing tech bosses to answer questions about their market power before the House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, albeit remotely, was bound to be political theater. Republicans spent most of their time accusing Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google of censorship of conservative views. One congressman wanted to know why his campaign emails were ending up in his parents\u2019 Gmail spam filters.   But there were questions that made the tech moguls squirm. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler cited emails where Zuckerberg describes how buying new competitors, like the purchase of Instagram in 2012, buys Facebook time. In a 2012 note posted by the Verge, the social network\u2019s founder said \u201cInstagram can hurt us.\u201d Instagram executives were worried that if they didn\u2019t sell, Facebook would go into \u201cdestroy mode.\u201d   Bezos also faced uncomfortable questions about Amazon\u2019s 2010 acquisition of Quidsi, which ran Diapers.com. A congresswoman referred to documents that showed Amazon was willing to lose $200 million a month before the acquisition by undercutting prices on Diapers.com, which it saw as a threat in that product category. The committee has been investigating Big Tech for a year; it looks like the time hasn\u2019t been wasted.   Regulators gave these acquisitions a free pass at the time, but they might not do so again. Each of the four that appeared in front of Congress is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department. Demands could range from behavioral curbs to, at worst, a breakup. There are also several bills in Congress to strengthen antitrust laws, and the subcommittee will eventually produce a report on the evidence it has collected.   At times, the tech chiefs seemed caught by surprise by the questions they faced on Wednesday. Bezos claimed at one point that he couldn\u2019t recall particulars over the Diapers.com saga. That suggests it\u2019s time the foursome took a walk down memory lane before the next phase of the tech backlash begins.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNGR-42716126914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G6-X9Y1-JCSC-J2F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters Deutschland</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - German</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Mittwoch 29.

That\u2019s the case for ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, which saw second-quarter revenue fall 29% from a year earlier, it said on Thursday. True, things won\u2019t be in this state for long \u2013 hopefully. Still Uber\u2019s prognosis is far from all clear after Covid.   The $60 billion company\u2019s flagship service, now called mobility, got walloped in the three-months ended June 30. Gross bookings fell 75% year-on-year to $3 billion. The delivery business, once known as Eats, fared much better. That may be the bottom of the top-line dip as people start to stir. But Uber still has some sharp turns to navigate.   One is that it\u2019s still Exhibit A for the gig economy. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has done a decent job cleaning up the toxic atmosphere and devil-may-care attitude of the fledging startup under co-founder Travis Kalanick. That hasn\u2019t stopped drivers from agitating for benefits. Many states, most notably California, are trying to force Uber, rival Lyft and other tech outfits that rely on contract workers to count them or at least treat them as employees. That could significantly push up Uber\u2019s costs and even upend its business model. Shares of the firm are down nearly 30% since its initial public offering in May of last year.   One bright spot for Uber is delivery, which outpaced rides by miles: gross bookings more than doubled to $7 billion, representing nearly 70% of all bookings. No wonder Khosrowshahi is shining a light on delivery in order to diversify and capitalize on consumers ordering in instead of going out to restaurants. No. 2 player Uber\u2019s deal to buy the No. 4 U.S. food-delivery service Postmates is a key step to make it profitable. It\u2019s so important that Uber committed bridge financing for the struggling target during the regulatory process.   The $2.7 billion deal, though small, will probably receive outsized attention from Washington and state watchdogs already leery of Uber and protective of small businesses like restaurants faced with potentially higher delivery costs. Khosrowshahi\u2019s big tech peers at Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple were grilled by Congress last week about anti-competitive behavior. Just because Khosrowshahi wasn\u2019t summoned to Capitol Hill doesn\u2019t mean he has escaped notice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNGR-42778885177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HX-NPX1-F07F-82HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters Deutschland</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - German</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Donnerstag 6.

That\u2019s the case for ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, which saw second-quarter revenue fall 29% from a year earlier, it said on Thursday. True, things won\u2019t be in this state for long \u2013 hopefully. Still Uber\u2019s prognosis is far from all clear after Covid.   The $60 billion company\u2019s flagship service, now called mobility, got walloped in the three-months ended June 30. Gross bookings fell 75% year-on-year to $3 billion. The delivery business, once known as Eats, fared much better. That may be the bottom of the top-line dip as people start to stir. But Uber still has some sharp turns to navigate.   One is that it\u2019s still Exhibit A for the gig economy. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has done a decent job cleaning up the toxic atmosphere and devil-may-care attitude of the fledging startup under co-founder Travis Kalanick. That hasn\u2019t stopped drivers from agitating for benefits. Many states, most notably California, are trying to force Uber, rival Lyft and other tech outfits that rely on contract workers to count them or at least treat them as employees. That could significantly push up Uber\u2019s costs and even upend its business model. Shares of the firm are down nearly 30% since its initial public offering in May of last year.   One bright spot for Uber is delivery, which outpaced rides by miles: gross bookings more than doubled to $7 billion, representing nearly 70% of all bookings. No wonder Khosrowshahi is shining a light on delivery in order to diversify and capitalize on consumers ordering in instead of going out to restaurants. No. 2 player Uber\u2019s deal to buy the No. 4 U.S. food-delivery service Postmates is a key step to make it profitable. It\u2019s so important that Uber committed bridge financing for the struggling target during the regulatory process.   The $2.7 billion deal, though small, will probably receive outsized attention from Washington and state watchdogs already leery of Uber and protective of small businesses like restaurants faced with potentially higher delivery costs. Khosrowshahi\u2019s big tech peers at Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple were grilled by Congress last week about anti-competitive behavior. Just because Khosrowshahi wasn\u2019t summoned to Capitol Hill doesn\u2019t mean he has escaped notice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNGR-42779254764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HX-NPX1-F07F-82NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters Deutschland</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - German</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Donnerstag 6.

That\u2019s the case for ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, which saw second-quarter revenue fall 29% from a year earlier, it said on Thursday. True, things won\u2019t be in this state for long \u2013 hopefully. Still Uber\u2019s prognosis is far from all clear after Covid.   The $60 billion company\u2019s flagship service, now called mobility, got walloped in the three-months ended June 30. Gross bookings fell 75% year-on-year to $3 billion. The delivery business, once known as Eats, fared much better. That may be the bottom of the top-line dip as people start to stir. But Uber still has some sharp turns to navigate.   One is that it\u2019s still Exhibit A for the gig economy. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has done a decent job cleaning up the toxic atmosphere and devil-may-care attitude of the fledging startup under co-founder Travis Kalanick. That hasn\u2019t stopped drivers from agitating for benefits. Many states, most notably California, are trying to force Uber, rival Lyft and other tech outfits that rely on contract workers to count them or at least treat them as employees. That could significantly push up Uber\u2019s costs and even upend its business model. Shares of the firm are down nearly 30% since its initial public offering in May of last year.   One bright spot for Uber is delivery, which outpaced rides by miles: gross bookings more than doubled to $7 billion, representing nearly 70% of all bookings. No wonder Khosrowshahi is shining a light on delivery in order to diversify and capitalize on consumers ordering in instead of going out to restaurants. No. 2 player Uber\u2019s deal to buy the No. 4 U.S. food-delivery service Postmates is a key step to make it profitable. It\u2019s so important that Uber committed bridge financing for the struggling target during the regulatory process.   The $2.7 billion deal, though small, will probably receive outsized attention from Washington and state watchdogs already leery of Uber and protective of small businesses like restaurants faced with potentially higher delivery costs. Khosrowshahi\u2019s big tech peers at Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple were grilled by Congress last week about anti-competitive behavior. Just because Khosrowshahi wasn\u2019t summoned to Capitol Hill doesn\u2019t mean he has escaped notice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He frequently asserts, without evidence, that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.  'without evidence'.

Within hours, my Facebook feed included an ad from iFLY inviting me to imitate Peter Pan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Long ago, I gave up complaining about such an intrusion. The marketing sharpies really can't hurt me, and I don't have any great secrets anyway. Plus, I hold a defeatist attitude: There's no reason to fight the machine.</p><p>Thank goodness others aren't so timid. It's long overdue, but key lawmakers and influencers are waking up to the negative effects of tech giants Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. After years of looking the other way, Congress is holding hearings studying their impact. Among the more unabashed critics is conservative Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, whose June essay \"Overthrow the Prince of Facebook\" noted \"everybody knows they're too powerful, too arrogant, loom too large in public life.\"</p><p>Noonan's solution: \"Break them up. Break them in two, in three; regulate them. Declare them to be what they've so successfully become: once a pleasure, now a utility.\"</p><p>My annoyance about the iFLY ad is trivial except when considering the chain of events: An entrepreneurial entertainment company builds a website that almost assuredly relies on a tech giant to help grab personal information. I could reject the tracking software, maybe, but that would make my fact-checking either difficult or impossible.</p><p>iFLY then pays Facebook to target an unwanted ad at me. It's a more efficient advertising buy than for iFLY to spend money for my local newspaper's print or online editions - or maybe even certain magazines that circulate around North Carolina.</p><p>The result is the collapse of the publishing industry's business model, a condition so severe that it was a key subject in last month's congressional hearings. Google and Facebook now grab about 60% of U.S. digital advertising revenue, which is expected to exceed TV ad spending this year for the first time.</p><p>Arrogance and short-sightedness by print moguls exacerbated the industry's decline. But can anyone argue that Google or Facebook execs care more about Gastonia's future than the Gaston Gazette's leadership, much less any other community across our state? Current trends suggest there soon won't be a Gaston Gazette, or other newspapers like it.</p><p>Beyond my iFLY annoyance, I agree with Noonan that there's an increasing agreement about Big Tech's negative impacts: Mostly unchecked misuse of social media has helped erode democracies across the world; anti-competitive behavior such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram reduces choice and innovation; Amazon abuses competition by serving as both an online shopping platform and a seller of its own products that receive favorable treatment.</p><p>Big Tech \"may be more socially powerful than the trusts of the Roosevelt era, and yet they still operate like a black box,\" Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri who wrote a biography of Teddy Roosevelt, told The New York Times.</p><p>To be sure, the odds that Congress will rein in Big Tech are about as good as my ability to fly outside the Concord wind tunnel.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put her habit of mincing no words in policy discussions on display a few weeks ago when she released a proposal to \"break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was a courageous move on several levels. First, the big tech companies long have been assumed to be natural allies of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, the presidential nomination of which Warren has been seeking. Nevertheless, she brought her plan to the SXSW Conference, an annual high-tech hoedown in Austin, Texas, showing that she wasn't afraid of fielding fastballs from those who might be most directly affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren outlined her proposal in terms that customers of the named companies are likely to understand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" she wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>She's right; if anything, her proposal is too narrow. It should be applied not merely to tech platform companies with revenues of $25 billion of more, as she proposes, but to other monopolizing corporations that have consistently eroded freedom of choice and privacy protections, such as internet service providers.</p><p>The three companies she named -- and some she did not -- have grown too big and too quickly for U.S. government regulators to get their hands around their consequences for competition and innovation.</p><p>European regulators, who work with a different set of antitrust rules, don't seem to have the same problems. Last week, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for using its dominance in online search to force third-party websites to restrict ads for Google competitors. The action brought the total EU fines imposed on Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., to about $9.3 billion since 2017.</p><p>Thanks to their ownership structures, Facebook, Amazon and Google have been almost impervious to outside scrutiny in the U.S. Facebook's co-founder and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg controls 60% of shareholder votes thanks to a two-class share structure; Amazon.com founder and Chairman Jeff Bezos owns only 16.3% of its shares, but he's so closely identified with its success that it's almost inconceivable that the company would follow any course with which he disagreed.</p><p>That means that imposing regulatory discipline from outside is imperative to keep these companies from flouting the public interest.</p><p>Warren proposes to do so in two main ways. First, she would use existing antitrust authority to unwind mergers that the big companies have used to stifle competition. Among those she mentions are acquisitions by Amazon of the grocery chain Whole Foods, by Facebook of the social media firms Instagram and WhatsApp, and by Google of the advertising platform DoubleClick, the home appliance company Nest, and the traffic app Waze.</p><p>Warren's argument is that these takeovers gave the parent companies too much power to advantage their own products and services over competitors' offerings. They could do so thanks to their control of their \"platforms,\" through which they attract consumers to their websites and extract personal data they can sell or otherwise exploit, typically without the full awareness of their users. These platforms include Amazon's online marketplace, Google search and Facebook's social network.</p><p>That leads to the second part of her plan, which is to designate the big platforms \"platform utilities\" and prohibit any company to own both a platform utility and a service using that platform. Amazon could own either its merchandise distribution platform or its online store, but not both; Google would have to spin off its search service and its advertising exchange.</p><p>The platforms, which are free to users but funded from ad sales or commissions from commercial transactions, could still carry advertising or charge transaction fees, Warren says; they would just have to do so in arm's-length arrangements.</p><p>Warren's plan quickly attracted a backlash from conservatives and pro-business pundits. \"Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of users and consumers,\" declared Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review.</p><p>Lowry and other critics wrung their hands over how Warren's proposal would reduce the big companies' ability to drive innovation.</p><p>The truth is, however, that most innovation in Silicon Valley and the broader high-tech world comes from small start-ups, exactly the kinds of companies that struggle to reach the marketplace, in part because the big companies stand in their way to protect their own products and services.</p><p>That's also true of the activities of big internet service providers that have been permitted to acquire content companies, resulting in the Comcast-NBCUniversal and AT&amp;T-Time Warner mergers. Signs that providers unaffiliated with ISPs face higher costs and other disadvantages reaching the public have proliferated.</p><p>On CNBC, New York Times business columnist James Stewart asserted that \"there is nothing illegal about becoming a monopolist because you're so good at what you do that others can not compete with you.\" That's true, but Warren's point is that these companies have become monopolists by using their heft to disadvantage others that might have better ideas but can't reach the public with them.</p><p>Nor is there anything particularly novel about the principles Warren is expressing. \"From Standard Oil to the railroads to AT&amp;T, America has a long history of breaking up big conglomerates,\" she told me by email. \"Back then, we recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest. My plan follows that same tradition.\"</p><p>Government-mandated breakups of large corporations aren't panaceas for what has ailed capitalism, but it's incorrect to dismiss them out of hand, as Stewart did.</p><p>The 1934 breakup of United Aircraft &amp; Transport into United Airlines, Boeing and United Technologies arguably liberated the aircraft manufacturing and airline industries from anti-competitive conflicts of interest. The 1948 court order requiring the movie studios to divest their theater chain broadened the availability of films to the moviegoing public.</p><p>The best example is the court-ordered 1982 breakup of the AT&amp;T monopoly into seven \"Baby Bells,\" which launched a period of unparalleled innovation and price-cutting in telecommunications. Before then, AT&amp;T had the power to control the design and distribution of telephones, to stifle the development of data networks such as the internet, and to profiteer from local and long-distance calls.</p><p>After the breakup, we got new phone technologies, cheaper phones, less-expensive calling plans, and vastly expanded data communications.</p><p>Stewart scoffed that the Baby Bells have just coalesced back together, so the effort was just a waste of time and money, but his take was both incorrect and irrelevant.</p><p>The spinoffs have reunited into not one but two companies, Verizon and the rechristened AT&amp;T (formerly Southwestern Bell or SBC). In any case, that development is the result of lax antitrust enforcement after 1982, not of any flaws in the original breakup, the virtues of which long have been manifest. As it happens, Warren in her proposal points directly to the drawbacks of \"weak antitrust enforcement,\" and she pledges to turn that around if she's elected.</p><p>The anti-competitive ills that Warren talks about are hardly mythical. In 2014, Amazon interfered for months with sales of books from Hachette Book Group, the owner of Little, Brown and other imprints, in a dispute over Amazon's pricing of online sales of Hachette books. In 2010, Amazon pulled books from Macmillan -- the owner of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, St. Martin's Press and other publishers -- in a dispute over e-book prices.</p><p>Facebook, for its part, managed to prove Warren's point about the excessive power of the big platforms by removing several ads her campaign had placed promoting her proposal.</p><p>\"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" she promptly tweeted. \"Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power.\"</p><p>Facebook restored the ads after its action was made public.</p><p>--</p><p>Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

It was the first time CES has ever hosted a session on the topic, event organizers confirmed - a milestone that shows that concerns about the companies' power and size are forcing an internal reckoning for the industry. </p><p>- The landmark discussion arrived as regulators and lawmakers in Washington and dozens of state enforcement leaders grapple with those same antitrust considerations and weigh next steps as part of a series of high-profile investigations. </p><p>- The session itself - titled \"Should Big Tech be Broken Up?\" - featured heavy skepticism from a largely industry-friendly panel. Asked the question at the heart of the discussion, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation President Robert Atkinson replied, \"The answer is no.\" </p><p>- Atkinson said any antitrust case should focus on a company's conduct, not size. \"The simple fact that the companies are big is not a problem in and of itself,\" he said. Zach Graves, the head of policy at Lincoln Network, a right-of-center tech advocacy group, later decried the breakup proposals as an example of the \"sledgehammer-style policy solutions\" Washington officials float. </p><p>- But worries did not go unmentioned. Charlotte Slaiman, policy counsel for the consumer group Public Knowledge, said she was \"very concerned about the power of big tech.\" But she also suggested that regulators and lawmakers could take other actions to address those concerns, including enacting federal privacy legislation and creating a new federal regulator dedicated to oversight of the industry.</p><p>AI BIAS FINDINGS ALARM DHS OFFICIAL - Andre Hentz, the acting deputy undersecretary for science and technology, told us he's unsettled by a recent federal study that found pervasive racial biases in facial recognition software systems. And he said the findings are \"not lost\" on the agency, which is working to address the issue. A sweeping analysis by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found facial recognition systems more frequently misidentified people of color than white people, in some systems up to 100 times more often. </p><p>- \"That's a data point that now we're concerned about,\" Hentz told Cristiano after speaking at a session on artificial intelligence, privacy and security. He added, \"We are actively trying to understand what we can do to affect it in a positive way.\"</p><p>- Hentz said part of the problem is figuring out what's driving the misidentifications from a technical standpoint - \"whether it's a tonal thing or what is the underpinning science.\" And there lies a possible remedy, he said, adding, \"We're going to need to create that science.\"</p><p>BUT HOLD OFF ON THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION MORATORIUM - Michael Hermus, who served as DHS' chief technology officer from 2015 to 2018, pushed back strongly on calls by some House lawmakers for Congress to place a moratorium on federal use of facial recognition software. \"While it's absolutely critical that we act responsibly and we take all these issues of privacy and security [with] utmost seriousness ... if we were to put a moratorium on the use of AI we would fall even further behind in this arms race that we're talking about for AI supremacy globally,\" he said while speaking onstage with Hentz and other panelists. </p><p>- And it's not just a tech issue, he said. \"My view is it's a national security imperative that we are able to make progress, rapid progress on artificial intelligence going forward. If we don't it'll be to our own great detriment. I think a moratorium is a terrible idea.\" </p><p>GET YOUR GOVERNMENT INTO MY BLOCKCHAIN: It's fair to say there's no deep hunger among the CES crowd for getting government more greatly enmeshed in the inner workings of tech. As former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn put it while moderating earlier in the week, \"The one word everybody in this room hates to hear is the 'R' word: regulator.\" But one real exception emerged today in Vegas: blockchain in general, and cryptocurrency in particular. </p><p>- Blockchain's a bit different from other tech, in part because of its ties to finance, an industry in which governments have traditionally played a big role. What's more, the thinking goes, government can help it enter the mainstream, something the panelists said countries like Singapore, Switzerland and the U.K. have done. </p><p>- \"No [blockchain] entrepreneur in their right mind thinks of the U.S. first if they have other choices,\" said Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, on a panel today - pointing to what she called the United States' confusingly patchwork approach to distributed digital ledgers. \"And the problem is, we've now got a global landscape where we have other choices,\" said Ro, adding, \"The U.S. has to get its act together.\"</p><p>- \"When you have the reputation of a global financial center, you have to maintain that,\" said Ed Vaizey, a former British MP who, as Prime Minister David Cameron's digital economy minister, helped push out a landmark 2016 government report meant to put the U.K. government on the tech's cutting edge.</p><p>- Why hasn't the U.S. figured out some coherent way of thinking about blockchain? The lone American legislator on the panel, New York State Assemblymember Clyde Vanel (D-Queens), attributed it to everything from the lack of tech sophistication among the elected to the raging \"techlash.\" Said Vanel, \"We have to figure this out soon because we will keep falling behind the rest of the world.\"</p><p>THE CUTTING EDGE OF 'PORK' TECH - Plant-based meat has been a big winner at CES, anchored by Impossible Foods' high-profile rollout of its plant-based pork. An Impossible spring roll was the first course at CTA's glitzy Leaders in Technology dinner Wednesday night at the Wynn, and the vegetarian entr\u00e9e was an Impossible steak. After opening with a winding joke about feeding Christians to lions in ancient Rome, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took up the topic while introducing Impossible's CEO, Stanford biochemistry professor Pat Brown.</p><p>- \"The meat lobby is now blocking calling his product 'meat,'\" said Ross. \"So I suggest calling his product 'taem,' which is meat spelled backwards. You could even use as a slogan, 'Whichever way you spell it, it tastes the same.'\" </p><p>- CTA CEO and President Gary Shapiro followed up with a joke about getting President Donald Trump to try a plant-based hamburger. </p><p>GIMME THAT GOOGLE GOODNESS - The hot ticket at the convention center? Google's two-story gumball machine, a promotional device for the company's voice-activated Google Assistant. Attendees insert a plate-sized coin into the machine and are rewarded with a giant \"gumball\" - a cantaloupe-sized canister containing one of about 30 different prizes, from a Google-branded beanie cap to a Nest home thermostat, which retails at around $250. </p><p>- At mid-afternoon Thursday, the wait to get a chance at a Google gumball was two hours long. </p><p>Protocol's David Pierce and Janko Roettgers have called it: 5G is the buzzword of CES. People are talking about it on panels, in hallways and at poker tables. The most popular product here: \"a thing you already own, but 5G!\"</p><p>Beyond fast Netflix downloads, what will 5G offer? AT&amp;T's Chris Penrose gave David one of the best answers yet: \"remote control of everything.\" Anything usually done in person - driving heavy machinery, multiplayer gaming, surgery, anything - could soon be done from thousands of miles away.</p><p>But it will initially do more for businesses than consumers. \"5G is absolutely critical for us,\" Pandora's Chris Phillips told Janko, citing lower latency and better ad-insertion as reasons he's excited. And the technology came up repeatedly in talks about the future of cities. </p><p>And it won't usurp 4G completely in 2020. Most companies don't know what to do with 5G, Penrose said: So many have approached AT&amp;T looking for advice that it started a 5G consulting practice on the side.</p><p>Still, at least one CES attendee is already thinking forward. When 5G was mentioned during a privacy panel, he rolled his eyes and flashed a 10G pin on his lapel.</p><p>Elsewhere at CES: Wednesday night was party night, and musical guests were out in force. Snoop Dogg spinning at Twitter's shindig; Stevie Nicks at JBL's soiree; Drake at the Wynn into the early hours.

So many of us use a similar set of Internet services every day to text, search, or shop, among other online activities.</p><p>Today, a handful of actors play a significant role in our increasingly connected societies. Besides the Silicon Valley firms, Tencent and Alibaba are also growing their dominance, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and across multiple dimensions including payment services.</p><p>The debate on the influence of these companies has typically focused on the economics, namely how they could buy out potential competitors and use their dominance to move into other lines of business. Other arguments include worsening income inequality, weakening workers\u2019 bargaining power, and slowing innovation. But, this is not just about big tech; it is also about the Internet.</p><p>As the markets concentrate, it is time society ponders what it means for not only competition and consumer choice, but also the technical aspects of the Internet.</p><p>The technical implications for the Internet could be real and are too important to ignore. We should be clear-eyed about the possibility that a more centralized Internet could impede its resilience, openness, and diversity \u2014 properties that have made the Internet thrive.</p><p>These platforms run on what we call total service environments. They have evolved into providing a range of communications, entertainment, and productivity and lifestyle services and tools designed to be \u201cone-stop shops\u201d on the Internet. To keep users engaged and continue to grow revenues, they expand into new service and content areas. They also gain market share in their respective markets due to data control and network effects.</p><p>In fact, our continuous research into the area, spearheaded by our flagship Global Internet Report 2019 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://future.internetsociety.org/2019/\">https://future.internetsociety.org/2019/</url>), shows trends of consolidation are taking place not only in applications, but also in access provision, such as Internet Service Providers (ISP) and mobile network operators, and service infrastructure, such as naming and addressing management and hosting and distribution of content.</p><p>The effect is that the open, collaborative, and interoperable Internet is increasingly influenced by a small number of large companies, and organizational scale and market share play a significant role in the development and deployment of the open technical standards on which the Internet depends.</p><p>We observe the growing use of largely platform-driven application programming interfaces (API) puts more of the Internet\u2019s functionality and interoperability in the hands of powerful ecosystems, whose interests may not align with those of others.</p><p>Finally, future innovation, services, and applications may depend on the availability of a small set of proprietary platforms and services, rendering those applications less resilient, reliable, and capable of supporting further innovation.</p><p>There are clear benefits to operating at scale, including how platforms can greatly benefit the user by providing services that offer seamless experiences. However, it is unclear what the impact is on innovation, entrepreneurship and, importantly, competition.</p><p>We believe that the Internet and the important properties that make the Internet such a powerful platform empower users with certain abilities. These abilities underpin the social value that the Internet provides to people, and includes the ability to connect, speak, innovate, share, choose, and trust. Some of these are bound to be more susceptible to impact from consolidation if this trend continues unabated.</p><p>None of this comment is to urge policymakers to regulate, which in turn could lead to consumers potentially not being able to use the popular products they appreciate. It is important that we realize measures against consolidation could create unintended consequences both for markets and the Internet.</p><p>It is why before society decides if, or how, it should regulate big tech, we should further the understanding of how an increased consolidation may shape the technical future of the Internet \u2014 and what we need to do to preserve it.</p><p>RAJNESH SINGH is Regional Director of the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau at the Internet Society.</p><p>@RajneshSingh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWORLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWORLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB5-0YM1-JCBG-S0MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BusinessWorld Publishing Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BusinessWorld</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. Elizabeth's plan would help ensure tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.

Amid the increasing calls to break up big tech companies, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with CBS News[2], 'I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized.' Cook further added, 'I don't think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly.' Monopoly or not, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes the tech giant should have broken up years ago..@NorahODonnell[3]: 'Is Apple too big?'Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'No, I don't think so. But, with size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized. I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple is a monopoly.' </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/m8W4Yr7lkW\">https://t.co/m8W4Yr7lkW</url>[4] pic.twitter.com/hRpZnUfLUT[5]; \u2014 CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) June 5, 2019[6] Woz favors the 'break up big tech' callsSteve Wozniak left Apple in 1985, but the outspoken Apple co-founder often weighs in on the company's products, services, and strategy. He said in an interview with Bloomberg[7], 'I wish Apple on its own has split off a long time ago and spun off independent divisions to faraway place and let them work independently, like Hewlett-Packard did when I was there.' In the same interview, Wozniak said the new Apple Card[8] was 'beautiful.' He added that the Apple Watch had become 'my favorite piece of technology in the world right now.' In the past, he has also said that Apple was falling behind on the foldable smartphone technology. Samsung and Huawei have already launched[9] their foldable phones. Wozniak has a different reason for favoring the break up of Apple than politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He told Bloomberg that breaking up Apple would allow engineers to work more independently. Wozniak wants Apple to do something similar to what Hewlett-Packard did in 2015 when it split itself into two entities - one with PC and printer business, and another with data storage and enterprise business. 'I think big tech has gotten too big, it's too powerful a force in our life.' It's hard to escape big tech in the modern world. He also wants Google and Facebook to give users 'a choice to pay for almost no tracking.' Wozniak praised Apple for making money by selling products instead of tracking people. Wozniak is in favor of the 'break up big tech' campaign because the tech giants are using their dominance in one market to capture other markets. 'I am really against monopoly power being used in unfair antitrust manners,' said Woz. He believes the big tech companies are getting away with 'a lot of bad things.' The iPhone maker has been a vocal proponent of user privacy. But after whistle-blowers revealed[10] that it was secretly allowing its employees and third-party contractors to listen to your Siri recordings, Apple was forced to admit it. The contractors would listen to recordings of drug deals, medication information, and couples having sex. Woz criticized Apple, Google, and Amazon for using humans to listen to their voice assistant recordings.Will Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon be broken?Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have called for breaking up big tech companies. Warren had put up[11] a giant Break Up Big Tech billboard right in the heart of Silicon Valley. She has accused companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook of using their power to stifle competition. Facebook wanted to buy Snapchat. But when Snapchat founder refused to sell the company, Facebook responded by shamelessly copying[12] the most important features of Snapchat to Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook apps. Snapchat is now struggling to grow its user base. Tech giants like Facebook and Google are already facing antitrust investigations. Apple has also been accused of using its power unfairly. Music streaming service Spotify has accused[13] Apple of abusing the dominance of the App Store to take a hefty cut of the in-app purchases while also having its own music streaming app. According to the Wall Street Journal[14], the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal where the former would investigate Apple and Google while the FTC would look into Facebook and Amazon. It's too early to say whether regulators would break up any of these technology juggernauts. Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon each has market valuations of between $500 billion and $1 trillion. Breaking up these technology giants will not be as easy as it seems. Products and services in Apple's ecosystem offer a seamless experience to users because they are owned by a single company and are tightly integrated. The same goes for Amazon and Google. However, breaking them up could give consumers more choices. The post Break Up Big Tech: Wozniak Says Apple Should Have Split Up Years Ago[15] appeared first on ValueWalk[16].

Elizabeth Warren's approach to breaking up America's tech giants is a dangerous reaction to a real problem. America should be concerned about the monopolistic power of these tech giants. It is a power unseen since America's pre-depression era of industrial robber barons. Yet her focus on the platforms, stoking fears that Amazon is more dangerous than Walmart, is reviving industrial-age answers that are dangerously wrong for our modern economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elected officials' misunderstanding of the tech industry, as famously exhibited by Sen. Orrin Hatch's (R-Utah) questioning of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, leads to proposals like Warren's that seek to vertically fracture these giants. Senators like Warren, (D-Mass.) see Facebook acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus VR as separate verticals that can be broken back apart. This confusion misses the point that Facebook is a digital communications company, these acquisitions are communication methods, and the danger of modern tech is in regulating the data, not the platform. To test Warren's breakup theory, we should look at Facebook as a digital post office.</p><p>The U.S. Postal Service delivers postcards, small letters, large envelopes, and nearly any size package. Even with FedEx and UPS competing for package delivery, Amazon's reliance upon the USPS is an indicator of its dominance. If Warren were to propose a breakup of the USPS in the same vertical manner she is advocating for Facebook or the other tech giants, such a plan could break the USPS into one company for postcards, one for small letters, one for large envelopes, and one for packages. This approach to breaking up the post office would result in entities that are unable to effectively serve the consumer.</p><p>Ironically, the USPS already offers an example of what smart regulation could look like for the tech giants. While every customer enters the USPS through a single door to send \"physical communication,\" USPS does not control every layer of delivery. Once a package is received, it is physically shipped by contractors, subcontractors, and even by FedEx when going to some countries. To serve its customers better, USPS has voluntarily fractured its business horizontally to ensure effective physical communication.</p><p>USPS, FedEx, and UPS all seek to dominate the physical communication space by perfecting their brands and services. Monopolistic power is prevented because the real value of these businesses is in controlling the trucks, trains, and airplanes that transport these packages.</p><p>The monopolistic power of the tech sector is in controlling user data. Like the USPS in the physical communication space, Facebook is competing to dominate the portal through which people digitally communicate. Like the transportation methods contracted by the USPS, smart regulation must horizontally fracture Facebook's control of the data is uses.</p><p>Smart, horizontal regulation would break the tech giants into three layers: companies that collect data, companies that curate data, and companies that use data. No tech company should be able to do more than one of these functions. Just like the USPS, FedEx, and UPS, they would all have to compete in the free market for usable data. Facebook would be able to use data across all its apps and platforms, but it would have to buy that data from a company that curates it. And when Facebook wants to collect data, it must contract with another company for code that collects data. This smart, horizontal approach to data would ensure transparency about what is collected, validity to what data is real, and free-market discovery of data value.</p><p>Warren is right that big tech must be broken up. The power these tech giants wield is far too great. Yet it is irresponsible data practices that make big tech powerful, not the breadth of their applications.</p><p>It is time for the tech sector to advocate for a smart regulatory environment, like requiring horizontal fracturing of data-dependent companies, before people like Warren pursue a dangerously uninformed reaction that kills our innovation economy.</p><p>Chris Draper is Des Moines businessman and venture capital investor on the FrontierTech Deal Team with the VU Fund in San Francisco.

This time it's whether the social media giant has an obligation to take down a viral video doctored to make Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sound like she was drunk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just the week before, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and French president Emmanuel Macron led a group of countries to sign an international accord known as the \"Christchurch Call\" to put pressure on tech companies, such as Facebook, to eliminate terrorist and extremist content online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And all that came on the heels of Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes's explosive op-ed in The New York Times declaring: \"It is time to break up Facebook.\"</p><p>Here's the thing: Short of Facebook voluntarily selling off pieces of itself, like Instagram or WhatsApp, any breakup would probably take years. Meanwhile, users and society will pay the price for the company's domination \u2014 whether it's invading our privacy or selling our data.</p><p>While that shouldn't stop critics like Rhode Island congressman David Cicilline from pushing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook has violated antitrust laws, there is also plenty to push on the regulatory front.</p><p>Leading the charge in Congress has been Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. A former venture capitalist and Virginia governor, Warner has circulated a 23-page white paper providing a policy framework on how government might protect consumers as well as curb the anticompetitive power of tech titans. Among the ideas: empowering the FTC to make rules for the digital landscape; comprehensive data protection legislation similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); and data transparency related to how companies use consumers' personal information.</p><p>Out of this work has come at least one bipartisan piece of legislation: the Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction Act, or DETOUR. Cosponsored by Warner, a Democrat, and Senator Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, the bill aims to prohibit big online platforms from using deceptive images and interfaces, known as \"dark patterns,\" to trick consumers into handing over personal data. It's not a theoretical fear: Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have all been accused of using deceptive wording or interface design to nudge users to surrender private data.</p><p>The bill calls for, among other things, the creation of a professional-standards body that works closely with the FTC to set guidelines for dark patterns; a ban on user design intended to create compulsive usage among children under 13; and a prohibition against segmenting consumers to conduct behavioral or psychological experiments without consent. (Facebook once conducted an experiment on 700,000 unwitting users by manipulating the information on their News Feed and then studying their emotional reaction.)</p><p>\"We're at a real moment of possibility. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There is a bipartisan support to do something about what we colloquially call the Facebook problem,\" said Salome Viljoen, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard who studies privacy and cybersecurity issues. \"Every advantage that Facebook and Google get is because they are extracting data from users. The parts of this bill that speak to how data is gathered and under what conditions people agree to that collection gets at the heart of market drive and the incentives these companies are operating under.\"</p><p>States and attorneys general can also play a role reining in Big Tech. Some states in recent years have strengthened data privacy laws, while AGs have been able to use consumer protection statutes to investigate bad digital practices. That's how Maura Healey launched a probe in March 2018 into Facebook over violations of its own privacy policies when it allegedly shared and/or failed to protect access to millions of users' personal data by app-makers, including Cambridge Analytica, the British data-analysis outfit hired by the Trump campaign in 2016. The investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Meanwhile, state legislatures can also do their part to protect consumers from emerging technologies. California, for example, passed in 2018 the nation's first \"Blade Runner\" law, or anti-bot measure, which requires automated accounts \u2014 or bots \u2014 to be identified on social media sites in an effort to protect Internet users from the spread of false information.</p><p>Calling for the breakup of Facebook always attracts headlines, but passing new laws, locally and nationally, might be a faster way to protect consumers and limit the power of Big Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-72044524-83b6-11e9-9330-eac65922dc8a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-7X91-JC2G-C4HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He doesn't expect the big tech companies to regulate themselves. He wants leaders who can: \"...rein in the tech giants with regulation and, possibly, by using antitrust laws[1].' So far so good. Read Galloway's full commentary on the link. </p><p>He also points out that unlike leaders like Trump and Putin, the corporations will be part of human reality for a long time. This longer view is at least a departure from the usual knee jerk responses to swarms of tech issues, bots, hacking, Cambridge Analytica, Wikileaks, etc., etc. and frenzy of ineffective bleating we're used to from the 'thought leaders'. Galloway has raised the issue and got people to listen, to his credit. The question is how the hell anything is supposed to be able to happen. He's quite right, but this is a far from simple picture. Bring a tent and read on. The ProblemsThese obvious problems, however, are likely to change drastically in the long term. They could get a lot worse, and fast. The advent of AI, mega-media, and a very much changed social and economic landscape need to be factored in. The law has been absolutely pitiful in keeping up with even the current level of tech. The core issues are: \u2022 Privacy and personal security\u2022 Financial security\u2022 Operating systems which run the planet\u2022 All communications networks of all kinds\u2022 Government systems\u2022 Military systems\u2022 Health systemsCorporations are going to be on the receiving end of all problems, as much as delivering these systems. Their long view is likely to be clouded somewhat by a large amount of stuff hitting the fan all the time. The Legal Issues for 'Leadership'There's no real indication that the situation is likely to change in the current leadership dynamic. Particularly with the United States almost totally dysfunctional in terms of leadership and international credibility, and anti-science to boot. Nobody is likely to believe, for example that:1. The US will suddenly adopt a rational, viable and sustainable posture in regard to online risks of any kind. 2. China and the Russian Federation will suddenly stop exploiting the world's extremely vulnerable online media and their chronic round the clock espionage practices. 3. Online privacy laws can get through the supremely constipated US Congress, where a useful global precedent for online regulation might otherwise be set. 4. Organized crime is going to suddenly respect people's privacy or anything else. The organized crime input is crucial, because they're the enablers of a lot of the actual attacks and hacks. In a country like the US, where organized crime is a virtual sacred cow, not much can be expected except a few minor busts, no real hits on the billion ton gorilla itself. 5. The ridiculous, (and in my opinion from experience with some smug secure bastard in France, insane), online security industry. This mega-rich, ultra-ineffectual moron festival of an industry has been and will be no use at all. Under their babbling, perverse, guidance internet and other crime have simply grown exponentially, untroubled. It is impossible to believe that the required basic comprehension, let alone the political will, is there at any level to even come up with a rational response to these issues. Governments have been screwing up internet regulation for decades. They have a track record of 100% failure. Even the theory of regulation has so far barely scratched existing problems, let alone the mega-blast of future issues already in motion. The Tech Problems to ComeOK, inspired enough so far? The next level of BASIC tech to be regulated will include:1. Multiple AI entities operating damn near anything and everything. These entities could be huge, bigger than whole server networks, like AI super colonies of ants. Just think - Every byte a risk. 2. The idiotic, shambolic, truly 200% half-ass Internet of Things, the all-time obvious risk creation mechanism for the future. How to create global vulnerabilities without really trying. 3. Private AIs in their millions which can do whatever they've been taught to do. Imagine a criminal AI or hundreds of thousands of them. Sound like fun? A few trillion bots/hacks/DOS attacks a second? It's doable, and it will be done. That's just a few of the more obvious risks. The fine detail could include billions of regulatory issues in context with Galloway's ideas. Into the Valley of Dumb Go the Big TechsConsider for a second or two the position of the tech giants in this mess:Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, etc. are right in the middle of both the new tech and the problems. The hardware guys are in very much the same general position from their end. The need is to develop; the next need will be to fix whatever these new technologies cause in terms of problems. The corporations are in an unenviable position. They're developing the tech themselves. Check out Google AI[2] and some recent developments in military AI [3]to see what's already making impacts. That, sadly, doesn't mean they or anyone else can predict vulnerabilities and/or prevent them. The positives of the big tech companies are:Centralized control applied across entire networks consistently. (OK, whether these controls work or not is the other issue. The point is that they CAN respond to their own issues pretty effectively.)Big capital to develop better, safer, more manageable systems. That's not to be sneered at too much. Even allowing for the occasional Developers' Fantasylands, extravagance and misguided developments, the money has to be there to grow the working systems. A degree of interaction among the market leaders. Unavoidable, but also good for consistent security, privacy, etc. if they do it themselves. The collective practical response can outmuscle and out-finance the nutcases, developing better systems and safeguards. The self defense mechanisms of big tech companies. The Cambridge Analytica horror story[4] may have had at least one positive effect. It's ludicrous to think that Facebook was naturally prepared for such a truly oblique form of abuse. That said, the response so far has been pretty fast, and is trying to do a good job of shoring up the bulkheads against future exploitation - To the extent it can. That may be a lot better than nothing, but the imponderables remain. Proper attention to legal risks. It's an irony that the last people to understand legal risks seem to be lawmakers. The corporations do understand, and the expected levels of legal ferocity in future will have them planning very thoroughly for those risks. It's likely that all the big techs have taken due note of the risks as applied to themselves. With due respect to Prof. Galloway's proposal, I don't see how smaller, more vulnerable and less capital-heavy corporations could fight the incoming tide of future issues. They can't be strong enough in the markets, and they don't have the 'Do it our way' clout of the major leaguers. Galloway is right that the world's dribbling, minutiae-obsessed governments should be doing their jobs, of course. The question is whether these regulatory retards can be brought up to speed to do what needs doing. It's not impossible. It's just likely to be maddeningly slow, and anything but thorough, when what's needed is thoroughness and speed. So start toasting the marshmallows. Could be a long vigil before much happens.

Brendan Carr is an FCC Commissioner. He just wrote his own op-ed responding to Mark Zuckerberg and he joins us tonight. Brendan, thank you very much for coming on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRENDAN CARR, FCC COMMISSIONER</emphasis>:  Thanks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  So the big tech companies would like free speech regulated by government. What could go wrong?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  It's pretty remarkable actually. So if you think about it, Facebook has been under mounting scrutiny recently for a number of its practices -- how it protects your online data, how it shares that data, and most directly now, how it moderates online speech. Lawmakers and the public have been asking a lot of serious questions about what they let you say on the platform, and the posts they let you see on the platform.   </p><p>      In response to that pushback, Facebook has come up with a new idea that heads in a totally wrong direction. It wants the government to step in and start policing your online speech for it and look, outsourcing government censorship -- outsourcing censorship to the government isn't just a bad idea, it's a violation of the First Amendment, so I'm a no on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  So, and Amen. And I'm glad that finally someone at the FCC -- I know there are others, but not enough -- is taking that very sensible constitutional position. But what about the original deal with the internet where we give these companies an exemption? They're not news companies. They are platforms, Congress has said that. And their job is just to let people say what they want as long as it's not illegal, they're not selling drugs, right? Or guns or peddling kiddie porn? Why don't we go back to that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  That's right. We want an approach that's going to promote a robust exchange of views. And what Facebook is talking about here is not targeting illegal content. What it described was harmful content. So this is content that is fully protected by the First Amendment. It's invited regimes, not just the government here in the U.S., but abroad to step in and start shutting down ideas that it doesn't like under the rubric of it being harmful speech.   </p><p>      One example that Mark Zuckerberg gave was speech on immigration. He said that speech on a divisive political issue, and if you're online advocating an issue position on immigration, the government should start regulating that speech.   </p><p>      And look, Mark Zuckerberg has a very loud platform, a big platform to express his own views on immigration and hot button issues.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  Of course.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  So then to step in and call for everyday Americans when they are advocating for those issues online, for the government to step in and police that, I think that's a bad idea.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  But Mark Zuckerberg is one of the richest people in the world and he has paid to lobby for open borders, not just speak, but influence our lawmakers, but you aren't allowed to? I just wonder, taking three steps back, how did we get here? Zuckerberg grew up in the United States. Most of these people did. This is a constitutional republic. Number one in the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech. They seem totally unaware of that. Why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  What's interesting, I've been a regular at the FCC for a number of years, and I can tell you, when large corporations come in and start calling for greater government control, they're not doing it as an act of charity.   </p><p>Facebook right now is a company that's worth a half a trillion dollars. It's got a leading position in the market. It didn't find religion and regulation until it established that dominant position.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  Exactly.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  They have 30,000 people right now. They're doing content and security review. So calling for this heavy-handed government regulatory regime is going to wreck an economic moat that only makes it harder for startups to compete in this space.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  That's exactly right. This is the real protectionism right there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARR</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARLSON</emphasis>:  Thank you so much for that. Good to see you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW5-25Y1-JDPT-T21J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

According to its draft charter, the purpose of this body will be to determine how content should be governed and enforced on the platform. Brent you have been involved in the initial phases of the board could you tell us more about the strategy and why your company feels it must look beyond its internal structures to curate online content?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The goal of the board is to extend decision making beyond the company itself and beyond Silicon Valley and hear from a wide array of people, voices and experts who stand beyond those we usually talk to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last six months we've talked to over 650 people in workshops and roundtables around the world from over 88 countries, and we've heard from over 1,200 people via public submissions. The consequences are that they've spotted a lot of issues and given us a huge amount of feedback. The rationale behind involving these people is that it should result in an institution that's stronger than if we had launched it on our own.</p><p>The approach you've set out for the oversight board has drawn comparisons to those of governmental structures. Yet international norms such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights already deal with issues such as freedom of expression, opinion and hate speech. Aren't there risks of reinventing the wheel or undermining existing mechanisms?</p><p>The approach we've taken is one that's informed by a number of global international norms, international laws and human rights. Facebook itself is rooted in free expression and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.]</p><p>The exercise that we're engaged in as one that's fundamentally grounded in and informed by work that's been advancing over last century around these types of international norms. What we are trying to do now is understand how these norms apply in the context of Facebook, Instagram and the digital sphere as a whole.</p><p>How might the oversight board operate in countries with a value system at odds with the international norms and human rights you've referred to?</p><p>When we think about building out this board, the board can have no more power, can be delegated no more power, than Facebook holds, and Facebook's ability to operate is bound by the laws in place in the countries in which it operates.</p><p>The board is not and cannot be a substitute for local laws, it's a question of how you extend beyond it and how you interpret situations where laws do not yet apply.</p><p>In the last five years, Facebook's position with regards to the government regulation has shifted significantly in favour of more legislations. Looking beyond the oversight board, what would be an ideal regulatory environment for a company like Facebook to continue to be successful?</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg has called for regulation in four areas: one is in election protection, a second is in data portability, a third is in privacy and data protection issues, and then a fourth is to do with harmful content.</p><p>What we believe and this is embodied both in the oversight board and our call for regulation is that because we're a private company, we shouldn't hold the full responsibility for content decisions that extend to over two billion people around the world.</p><p>What we are calling for is greater accountability, greater oversight and greater transparency. It's also important that democratic institutions and civil society have a voice and perspective on these issues so we can make the digital sphere fairer and more just then it is today.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Co-Founder of Facebook Chris Hughes have called for Facebook to be broken up, along with other big tech companies. Do you think that Facebook's dominant market position is a threat to competition?</p><p>Firstly, the market feels very competitive for us, we're in the middle of trying to figure out how to run the business, and secondly, the ability to deal with the types of concerns that people have articulated are not made easier by breaking up companies.</p><p>If you look at the types of issues around content moderation, around privacy, these require substantial systems and investments and technical insights that don't get stronger if you then try to fracture parts of a company.</p><p>What about today's start-ups which have to compete in an environment dominated by a handful of large tech companies - what challenges do you think a similar organization to Facebook would face if it was starting from scratch in 2019?</p><p>It's a good question. I think one of the major challenges would be how they deal with some of the government regulation that will come into play, the heightened expectations it will bring, and whether they'll have the right infrastructure in place to deal with that.</p><p>At the 2019 Chatham House Cyber Conference in June, Damian Collins MP spoke about two types of citizens: the 'remote-controlled' and the 'empowered', where the former is consuming information predetermined by algorithms, and the latter is able to access and navigate information free of algorithmic curation. Can you imagine a situation in which government regulation improves Facebook's algorithms?</p><p>There is going to be more regulation on just about every topic associated with technology and I believe more work needs to be done on these issues. However, one concern I have is that governments aren't necessarily in the best position to design and understand products. Moreover, they're not always well-versed in some of the really technical issues.</p><p>In the case of the algorithms, they're designed to bring people the content and information that they most want to see and the reason that those algorithms are in place is that they actually help people navigate a wide and vast array of different content.</p><p>LinkedIn recently announced that they have made changes to their algorithm to rank content related to a user's work interests above clickbait and viral content. What actions are Facebook prepared to take to ameliorate its newsfeed algorithms?</p><p>We are doing a lot of work to figure out down-ranking. If you look at misinformation for example, when third-party fact checkers come forward to inform us that a piece of content is fake or false, we essentially apply a speed limit making it far more difficult for that content to be seen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123069183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKD-G671-DYTH-G4NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Then the fracking revolution came and the U.S. resumed its place as the world's top oil and natural gas producer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petro-despots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.</p><p> Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.</p><p> You don't have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.</p><p> Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to \"ban fracking everywhere.\" Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports and a \"total moratorium\" on new fossil-fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state revenue.</p><p> Native American tribes also got about $1 billion from those leases in 2018. Isn't the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?</p><p> Or take health care: It may be ethically defensible for Warren to argue that Medicare for All is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down. As a political matter, it isn't surprising that she has not been forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.</p><p> But what about the fact that Warren isn't merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs approximately 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health insurance companies, isn't it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work?</p><p> Then there's big tech, another industry Warren doesn't like and promises to \"break up\" by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilities. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has ... a 1,700-word plan.</p><p> One wonders what Warren thinks might happen when things don't work out. Industries aren't assemblages of Lego blocks that can be taken apart and reassembled according to a clever new design. They are complex and evolving ecosystems, organized around scores of institutions, hundreds of laws, thousands of personalities and millions of relationships.</p><p> What will happen to the real human beings whose lives and careers will be upended or derailed while the mandarins of a Warren administration try to figure it out? Will President Warren have contingency plans for her ever-proliferating plans when things don't go according to plan?</p><p> Of course she won't. She won't because she can't; she can't because the central flaw of every economic plan is the plan itself.</p><p> That's the lesson of the 20th century, and it's why Warren's critics aren't totally off the mark in accusing her of being a socialist, not in intent but in mentality. Those with plans for everything prove only that they can't be trusted to plan for anything.</p><p> Voters may not yet see this, which is why Warren has risen in the polls. But they will, eventually, especially when they notice what the senator's plans entails for them. It's one thing for a Democratic politician to promise, as Barack Obama once did, to \"spread the wealth around\" \u2013 but only when \"wealth\" and \"wealthy\" mean the same thing. The Warren standard is to spread your wealth around whether you're wealthy or not.</p><p> In a recent column, my colleague David Brooks posed a difficult and necessary question: If the choice is Trump or Warren, what then? David's answer is that one would have to choose Warren, for the sake of democracy. Maybe he's right. But voters tend to place their personal interests ahead of their political ideals. And, other than Bernie Sanders, no Democratic candidate would more richly tempt Americans to vote the former than Warren.</p><p> For the sake of democracy, let's hope Democrats give America a better choice.</p><p> Bret Stephens is a columnist for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCO-1c8fcee31b63911bf36d695cd783270fb9b6579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898CC30BD3377 NWBKCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDJ-3FW1-DXVP-V170-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Durango Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Friday, September 28th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  Time to vote.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to  vote this morning after the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his  accuser Christine Blasey Ford testified on Capitol Hill yesterday. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSER:  I have been accused of  acting out of partisan political motives.  I'm an independently person and  I am no one's pawn. </p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will not be intimidated into  withdrawing from this process.  You've tried hard.  You've given it your  all.  No one can question your efforts.  But your coordinated and well- funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive  me out. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will have more of the emotional testimony coming up this  morning.  As of now, we know that Senators Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham  have said that they will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh.  More trouble for  musk.  The Securities and Exchange Commission filing suit against the Tesla  CEO.  The commission looks to bar him from running a public company ever  again.  Tesla stock is getting plummeted in the premarket.  It is down 12- 1/2 percent right now. </p><p>Futures also showing a decline at the start of trading.  We're at the lows  of the morning.  Things have been worsening throughout the morning.  Dow  Industrials down 108 points right now almost one half of one percent.  S&amp;P  500 is down a third of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 36 point decline  down a half percent.  This after a pretty good day yesterday.  The major  indices higher across the board at the close yesterday.  NASDAQ best  performer up 51 points. </p><p>We're at the end of the third quarter.  This is the last trading day of the  third quarter.  The Dow is up almost nine percent for the quarter.  The  NASDAQ and the Standard &amp; Poor's are up seven percent in the prior three  months.  In Europe this morning, weakness across the board, FT 100 down  almost one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down one and a quarter percent and  the DAX Index in Germany at the low of the morning down 1-3/4 percent.   Asian markets also mixed overnight but mostly higher. </p><p>The Nikkei Average best performer in Japan up 1-1/3 percent.  Well, beware  the bear.  The Trump economy showing no signs of slowing down, solid  employment numbers and a booming market all signs that the U.S. economy is  doing well.  One economist though is warning that a recession is on the  horizon.  He's here.  Nouriel Roubini will join us.  Joining me to break it  all down right now is our own Dagen McDowell along with Kadena Group  President Gary B. Smith, and the Hill Columnist, Fox News Contributor, Liz  Peek. </p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning. </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  </p><p>GARY SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND PRESIDENT, KADENA GROUP:  Nice to be  here. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Good to be here.  </p><p>PERRY:  -- the market is trying to figure out what to focus on, right?   There are so much going on, right? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is. </p><p>PEEK:  Yes. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  -- right now marching to its own drummer to be honest with you.   All the news I think the markets held steady, you know, Maria knows I've  been bullish since the get-go.  I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've right.  You've been right, Gary. </p><p>SMITH:  I probably still am, yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got -- we got a market that has had a pretty good  quarter and a backdrop, Dagen, as we talk about every day.  That shows four  percent plus economic growth.  You have the GDP out yesterday 4.2 percent  and earnings for the quarter is going to be up 22 percent. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Maybe see -- we'll  see three percent growth, three percent plus growth this calendar year.   The first time that we will that will have happened and I keep saying it in  more than a decade because it did not happen in any year during the Obama  administration.  </p><p>PEEK:  And by the way we're the only major economy growing like that.  So I  mean it's sort of hard for investors to figure out where else to go. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One -- just one thing I want to call out yesterday.  There was a  lot to be appalled by coming from the Democrats.  But I think the height of  hypocrisy was Senator Richard Blumenthal lecturing Brett Kavanaugh about  credibility talking about the legal principle that jurors can rule a  witness to be completely untrue if they say one thing that is false.  This  is a man who lied about serving in Vietnam and then said yesterday that the  accuser Blasey Ford had witnesses who could corroborate her story. </p><p>That's a lie.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  Which we know isn't true.  They would have been -- they would  have been presented to us before by the media for sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does he get away with that just saying fallacies? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- I'm ashamed that I ever lived in Connecticut that that  state would elect him to the Senate.  I am appalled by that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we should forget that Jim Comey also had a thing or two  to say about the same actually.  He tweeted about it.  And then Kim  Strassel from the Journal tweeted out about him because no mention of the  fact that she said she was afraid of flying and then, Mitchell, the sex  crimes prosecutor came up with a list, a litany of places from Hawaii to  Indonesia that she's been which was also pretty hypocritical. </p><p>PEEK:  This is all about stalling.  They just want to stall this process,  you know, that's why -- repeated requests for an FBI investigation,  etcetera, etcetera.  It's so politically driven.  It's really sad I think. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  It sure is.  We'll get to all of that including  the third quarter and get Gary's thoughts on what happens in fourth quarter  coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning Fox News Contributor and  former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove is  joining us this morning.  Roubini Macro Associates CEO, Nouriel Roubini has  a few things to say about that strength in the economy right now and what  happens in the future, and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY's\" own, Stuart Varney will  weigh in as well. </p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big hour coming up.  And we kick it  off right here with this top story.  Emotion, anguish, and reliving the  past, dramatic testimony yesterday on Capitol Hill as Judge Brett Kavanaugh  and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford made their case before the Senate Judiciary  Committee.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FORD:  I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I would  like to.  But the details that about that night that bring me here today  are the ones I will never forget.  They have been seared into my memory and  it has haunted me episodically as an adult.  Indelible in the hippocampus  is the laughter.  The laugh -- the uproarious laughter between the two and  they're having fun at my expense.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe  Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you? </p><p>FORD:  One hundred percent.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One hundred percent?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Less than two weeks ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of  committing wrongdoing in an event more than 36 years ago when we were both  in high school.  I denied the allegation immediately, categorically, and  unequivocally.  This confirmation process has become a national disgrace.   The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation  process.  But you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. </p><p>This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political  hit fueled with apparent pent up anger about President Trump and the 2016  election.  Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record,  revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from  outside left-wing opposition groups.  This is a circus. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now for White House reaction is White House  Senior Adviser for the Strategic Communications, Mercedes Schlapp.   Mercedes, good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for being here.   Your reaction to what took place yesterday. </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  Look,  it was a very long day and for Brett Kavanaugh, he spoke with great power  very compelling, and very consistent in his story.  He felt it was his  moment to talk about where -- the facts and he did that.  He brought out  the facts.  He brought out detail in terms of what -- of what his  activities where the summer of 1982.  But most importantly, Maria, he  talked about how disgraceful this process has been with the Democrats. </p><p>I mean let's be real.  OK.  The Democrats from day one said they were going  to do everything they could to stop Brett Kavanaugh.  That was their goal.   That was their focus.  They called him evil.  They called him a liar.   They've even gone out to the fact that agreeing with a certain allegation  that he could possibly be a gang raper.  I mean it is a process that's  become out of control.  And with that, the Democrats had also mishandled  this process. </p><p>They knew about this allegation for over 60 days, did nothing with it,  waited until the last minute, and then started to drag Judge Kavanaugh's  name through the mud.  It has been something like I've never seen before in  terms of trying to destroy someone who has served our country honorably,  someone who has spent his -- most of his life in public service, who has  worked for a former President, who has worked on the -- in the judicial  system very successfully and like how he has mentioned, Maria, he's an  independent judge. </p><p>He wants to do a good job.  He's well qualified for this job, yet this has  become a smear campaign, a character assassination of somehow who I know  personally and someone who I think should be on the Supreme Court. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean throughout the hearing yesterday the testimony  yesterday I think little by little people started to see through some of  the games that were going on, on the left, and I wonder if you have heard  from more people in the Senate in terms of the votes because we've already  heard from Bob Corker who says he will vote yes toward Brett Kavanaugh.  We  know that Lindsey Graham will.  I'm going to get to Lindsey Graham in a  moment.  But do you know of any -- do you think that the Senate has the  votes for confirmation certainly from the committee standpoint? </p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know, I feel we're in good shape.  I think that we'll see  what the Senate Judiciary Committee votes today what the vote is, but I  feel like we're in very good shape.  Obviously, Judge Kavanaugh was very  transparent, very forthcoming, presented the facts, presented evidence  against this allegation.  With that being said, obviously, what Dr. Ford  has experienced in her life is very saddening.  But it's very clear that  Judge Kavanaugh is innocent of this charges and he was willing to come  forth day one when these accusations came out, day one, and yet, you know,  here we are. </p><p>The GOP senator said we'll give her time.  We even -- they even offered to  go travel over to California.  She said she wasn't even aware of that  request, so you've got these Democrat political operative lawyers, Senator  Feinstein who referred her to these layers and you're saying that this is  not, you know, and there's people out there saying that this is not a  political game -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much -- how normal is it for a ranking member of the -- of  a major committee a judiciary committee to help a witness with her lawyer?   I mean Senator Feinstein's office helped Blasey Ford obtain her lawyer. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.  I just never seen anything like this and this is why  yesterday what it showed when the Democrats were trying to questioning  Kavanaugh, it was very clear that they were going to do what they can to  stop this man.  It is their biggest nightmare that he is decided that he's  not going to be intimidated that he's moving forward with this nomination,  that he's not going to stand down for the past 10 days what that family has  gone through is horrific.  It should not be like this in America. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it shouldn't.  And you're right to say America because  that's what is at stake here.  I mean we basically through due process out  the window.  That's not America.  Senator Lindsey Graham said with a lot of  people were thinking.  He stood out on a Republican side giving this  impassioned speech about how he has enough of what he calls a charade.   Watch this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  What you want to do is destroy  this guy's life, hold the seat open, and hope you win in 2020.  You said  that.  When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that Lindsey said hello  because I voted for them.  I would never do to them what you've done to  this guy.  This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kim Strassel writes this morning in the Journal a vote no  if you vote no, you are legitimizing the most despicable thing I've seen in  my time in politics as Lindsey Graham said it.  A no vote now equals public  approval of every unhanded tactic deployed by the left in recent weeks, do  you think that outburst by Lindsey Graham helps Kavanaugh's confirmation or  does it hurt it? </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I think Lindsey Graham was so incredibly powerful and at  that moment, it was critical for Lindsey Graham to send a message to these  Democrats.  These Democrats who have tried to smear Kavanaugh's name and he  stood up the same way Kavanaugh stood up for himself.  They got tired.   They're tired of being pushed by the left.  They're tired by the lies of  the left.  They're tired of false media -- liberal media reporting where  they would take any single possible accusation and try to pin it on  Kavanaugh. </p><p>And so it was an incredibly important moment during the hearing for all of  us because it represents that the Democrats are willing to go so low to  destroy an incredibly reputable man and I find that to be disgusting.  We  should, Maria, we should not be at that point right now when it comes to  confirming a Supreme Court justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Liz Peek who's on the panel today pointed out the  New York Times headlined today, and you speak about media.  The New York  Times says high stakes dual of tears and furry unfold in Senate.  And  here's the line, Blasey prays for courage, Trump applauds Kavanaugh's  rebuttal. That's how the Times sums it up. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.  And as Kavanaugh has said, this is about fairness.  This  is about both sides being heard.  This is, you know, again, we look at Dr.  Ford and maybe what she went through is incredibly difficult and we want to  listen as Kavanaugh said, sexual harassment of any kind is horrific.  But  with that being said, when you go to the basics take out the emotion, look  at the facts, look at the evidence. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  As it was presented in a public hearing yesterday under oath.  It  was very clear that Kavanaugh had the facts that is very clear that you had  those witnesses that basically had refuted her account.  So, again, we got  to look at the facts, put the emotions aside, and realize that Judge  Kavanaugh is innocent and has been saying he's innocent from day one.  He's  got the facts to prove it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mercedes, thanks for joining us this morning. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank you so much. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Mercedes Schlapp is at the White House.   Coming up, trouble with Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk faces an SEC lawsuit over  his, \"Funding secured tweet.\"  He could lose his title as CEO and be barred  from running a public company again.  Then the Trump economy, we're firing  on all cylinders that does not seem to be signs of a slowdown, but Nouriel  Roubini is in the studio and he's warning of a recession on the horizon.   He's here later this hour. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A lot happening in markets this morning, Tesla  stock is down 12 percent after the Securities and Exchange Commission  charged Elon Musk with fraud.  Connell McShane is on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange.  Connell, good morning. </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Yes,  what a disaster for Tesla.  I don't know that the SEC involvement as this  came as a huge surprise to people.  But the timing of the lawsuit being  filed last night came a bit faster than some people thought it might come,  and securities fraud allegations against Elon Musk does have that stock  tumbling.  The allegation here is that he Musk did not have the funding  secured that he talked about to take the company private at $420 a share. </p><p>In fact, the SEC alleges that he never even discussed $420 with anybody  that was -- that might provide that funding never really had his act  together on it, and, you know, never discussed whether it was possible or  not.  But he did put a statement out last night.  Musk was saying he was  saddened and disappointed and talked about his integrity being his most  important value, and says the facts will show he never compromised in any  way. </p><p>Now, I will say this a couple of analyst comments that are of interest this  morning, Citigroup just downgraded the stock a little while ago here before  the open of trading.  And also J.P. Morgan analyst had an interesting  comment on Tesla shares, Maria, saying that this lawsuit could lead to a  world where Tesla is valued on its fundamentals alone which would not be a  good thing because as you know the stocks had been bid up over the years so  much on a bet on one person.  That person being Elon Musk. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Yes.  I mean earlier we were talking about, you  know, what happens to Apple with Steve Jobs gone.  But Connell, that's why  investors are reacting this morning and that's what you're seeing this  morning.  Gary B. Smith, your thoughts on this as the stock trades down, do  you worry that should Elon Musk be forced out then this stock continues to  plummet? </p><p>SMITH:  Well, not only the stock.  I see trouble on the horizon for the  company.  It's essentially been his vision like it has been with his  private companies, the boring company, the, you know, what he does with the  rockets and stuff like that, so I worry that the vision just like when  Steve Jobs temporarily left Apple, they kind of plummeted.  The whole  vision and, you know, reason for existence for Tesla goes away.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it came back and it's now a trillion-dollar company, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I guess, but guess what's going to what happen today?  If  Tesla shares decline more than 9.44 percent today or trade below $278.45,  the company's market value will fall behind that of General Motors -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's my point is again we priced this like it's a  technology company.  Gary, it's just an automobile manufacturer -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- very mercurial founder. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- electrical cars that haven't really resonated all that much  significantly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  -- is cash flow problems.  That's the issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big cash -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  Quick break and then the high stakes in historic  hearing on Capitol Hill.  We'll take a look at the fallout.  Then trade  turmoil, what the tariff clashes between China and the U.S. mean for the  global economy?  That is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The high-stakes hearing on Capitol Hill and the  race to secure votes.  Senator Bob Corker announcing last night he say yes,  but there are a few key undecides.  The Washington Post reports former  President George W. Bush making calls this morning ahead of the final  confirmation vote next week in support.  Bush reportedly rallying support  from Republican Senator Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski,  along with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.  Key votes to Kavanaugh's  confirmation.  Joining us now is Fox News Contributor, former Deputy Chief  of Staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.  Karl, good to see you  this morning. </p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts. </p><p>ROVE:  Well, we had, you know, an historic moment yesterday if you take  each one of the presentations separately, they were both powerful, and  emotional, and credible.  But you can't take them separately.  You have to  take them together and then you have to examine them, and I thought the  Wall Street Journal editorial this morning got it absolutely right.   There's no corroboration of Dr. Ford's explanation.  The four people that  she mentioned at times it's been varying amounts. </p><p>But the four people that she has identified being there denied including  Leland Keyser who was her best friend or one of her best friends at the  time said she never even met Brett Kavanaugh.  We don't know how she got to  wherever she was.  We don't know how she got home.  All we know is that  that's some distance from where she started her day and she didn't speak of  it for 30 years until 2012 and even then didn't use Brett Kavanaugh's name,  so -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROVE:  -- you know, we're in a country where the presumption of innocence  and you've got, you know, it's the burden is not on him to prove that he  wasn't there.  But I thought he did a pretty good job with his calendars of  disapproving a negative. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Dagen, the op-ed that Karl refers to is from Kim  Strassel and she writes to vote against Judge Kavanaugh now is to overthrow  due process. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's that, you know, and also the editorial written by the  editorial board that they go into -- they go into the same issues of a  rejection will bring dishonor to the Senate.  It will validate the ambush  and smear politics that Democrats are using, but it will also turn Supreme  Court nominations over to the justice of the social media mob and the  politics of accusation.  It's time for the Senate to stand up and vote him  on to the Supreme Court. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>PEEK:  Karl, good morning.  It's Liz Peek.  It seemed like a public  sentiment really shifted dramatically from being pretty much in the court  of the accuser in the morning and then standing by Kavanaugh in the  afternoon.  At the end of the day, is it -- is it really going to come down  to public opinion?  Are Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, and Jeff Flake  really going to be swung by opinion polls or are we hoping that they are  actually going to see this for what Kim Strassel rightly points out is just  a complete dissent into anarchy here? </p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  I don't think any of the three people that you mentioned are  going to make decision by wetting their finger and blowing -- holding it in  air and see which way the wind blows, I don't.  The -- this is a -- this --  Kim is right.  The editorial board is right.  This is an important moment  for our political process.  If Judge Kavanaugh is not confirmed then this  will be a green light to use this in the future against any other Supreme  Court nominee that either side does not like. </p><p>But I will tell you, there's been -- I believe he will be confirmed.  Brett  Kavanaugh deserves to be confirmed and will be confirmed.  But the damage  to our system has been done.  And it's not going away easily.  They have  undermined confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court, this institution that for  so long in the modern era has stood aside from politics.  The Democrats by  organized systemic deliberate effort of character assassination have  undermined like it or not even if Brett is confirmed as I believe he will  be. </p><p>They have undermined the credibility of this great institution and it's not  going to be easily recovered. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just the way they undermined the credibility of the FBI and the  Department of Justice for not showing the world accountability after a  cabal of individuals put their finger on the scale or tried to stop Donald  Trump during the 2016 election.  Got to get that out because that's  important.  We need to trust our FBI and our DOJ.  Gary, go ahead. </p><p>SMITH:  Karl, Gary Smith.  Nice to see you again. </p><p>ROVE:  Gary B., good morning. </p><p>SMITH:  Good morning.  Quick question for you, if the nomination gets  derailed, what do you think the White House does as next steps? </p><p>ROVE:  Well, if it were to be derailed and I don't think it will be at this  point then they would quickly send out a replacement appointment and the  Republicans would move heaven and earth to get that nominee.  He or she  confirmed before the November election.  But the Democrats will use every  tool of obstruction they possibly can to stop it and there will be a period  during in which any new nominee is going to have to undergo the background  check that is routine. </p><p>And this is one of the things that gets me about Brett Kavanaugh who is a  personal friend of mine and a colleague from the White House for whom I  have enormous respect.  And his wife is one of the -- one of the finest  people that I know.  And he is undergone seven background checks including  two very deep background checks and when he was at the White House, and  then when he was put on the Court of Appeals, and none of this was ever  raised.  And I'm like Dagen. </p><p>I thought Dagen, you picked out one of my less favorite people on the  committee, Richard Blumenthal, that, you know, the stolen valor candidate  for the United States Senate who lectures Brett on credibility.  And so  many of the other members of the committee, you know, Senator Spartacus the  Thrace (ph), you know, was a hotdog in the hearings, and -- but all of  them, virtually, every one of them at the beginning of the -- even at the  beginning of the process before there was ever a hearing had announced  their intention to stop Brett's nomination, and they've used every tool  that they possibly can.  And shame on them for bringing -- for bringing  this on on the United States Senate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, Karl, I would just expand it beyond just that  committee in terms of some of my least favorite people who've ever been  elected to office in the history of the republic.  I would expand it to  that, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Another conversation.</p><p>ROVE:  You've got a broad group you're going after this morning.  I like  it.  You must be drinking a lot of caffeine to keep at it.  I like it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, we are fired up here, Karl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, it's Lindsey Graham got me fired up with that southern --  that southern flair and bluntness that we saw yesterday.  I paraphrase the  Great Chuck Yeager, we might be raw but we know right from wrong and we can  spot a phony before he ever says his first words.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes, I thought Lindsey was terrific --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that he brought the heat yesterday.</p><p>ROVE:  I though Lindsey was terrific in that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he said what a lot of people were thinking, that's for  sure.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes, and I thought Kavanaugh did a great thing by calling out the  Democrats right at the beginning about -- between this process.  I love the  hypocrisy of calling for an FBI investigation after Dianne Feinstein kept  an FBI investigation from being conducted for 60 vital days when all of  this could have been resolved in private and Dr. Ford could have kept her  privacy and Brett Kavanaugh could have kept his reputation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, that was rich.  They support women and yet, they threw  her under the bus real quick.  Karl, good to see you, thanks very much for  joining us.  Karl Rove.</p><p>ROVE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, miracle in Micronesia, a plane goes crashing off of  a runway and into a lagoon.  Everybody was safe and they walked away.  We  will tell you about it.  And then, the Trump economy, Nouriel Roubini is  here to react.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, September 28th,  your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the east coast.  We've got the  latest data on personal income and spending.  Spending was off three-tenths  of a percent in line with estimates.  Personal income also up three-tenths  of a percent, but that it was lower than the expectations of four-tenths of  a percent.  </p><p>Futures are lower this morning, just shy of the low of the morning, down 90  points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 8-3/4 on the S&amp;P, and the  NASDAQ was weaker by 27-1/2, one-third of one percent lower.  We are  expecting a lower opening at the start of trading in less than an hour.  In  Europe this morning, markets are down across the board.  Worst performer is  in Germany.  DAX Index down 1-3/4 percent.  Overnight in Asia, markets were  mostly positive with the exception of Korea, as you can see.</p><p>Fireworks on Capitol Hill yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee set to  vote on Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh this morning.  This, after he  and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford told their stories yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FORD:  I am here today not because I want to be, I am terrified.  I am here  because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while  Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.</p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I'm here today to tell the truth.  I've never sexually  assaulted anyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As of now, we know that senators Bob Corker and Senator Lindsey  Graham have said that they will vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh.  The  committee vote is at 9:30 a.m. this morning.  Rescue at sea, more than 40  people saved after a plane skidded off the runway and crashed into a  pacific lagoon.  We will have the very latest.  And getting ready to binge,  Netflix releasing a new trailer for the final season of hit program \"House  of Cards.\"  We've got the highlights, coming up.</p><p>But first, this, markets are lower this morning, as you can see, on this,  the last trading day of the third quarter.  This, after personal income and  spending data just hit the wire and a GDP number yesterday that was in line  with expectations, and growth of 4.2 percent.  That was the final reading  of the second quarter.  Joining us right now is Roubini Macro Associates  CEO, NYU Stern School of Business professor, economist Nouriel Roubini.   Great to see you, Nouriel, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>NOURIEL ROUBINI, CEO, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES:  Great being here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your characterization of the economy right now and what you're  expecting in the next year.</p><p>ROUBINI:  Well, the economy is doing well right now.  I expect it to grow  three percent this year, slightly less than three percent next year, but I  expect actually we're going to have a stall of growth and possibly a  recession by 2020, and that's due to many factors.  In my view, the economy  is growing three percent only because of a fiscal stimulus is one percent  of GDP.  This year and next year, by the end of next year, we have a  massive fiscal cliff that is more than one percent of GDP.  I don't think  that fiscal cliff is going to be (INAUDIBLE) easily.  Well, after the Fed  hiking from 225 all the way to 350.  The economy is obviously overheating.  </p><p>You have the trade wars, they're going to escalate.  This is not just a  trade war.  We'll have something of a cold war with China on trade, on  investment, on technology, on I.P., on everything, and it's not going to be  just with China, it's going to be with our allies and all the rest.  This  President was voted in on -- by American, (INAUDIBLE) American is  protectionist, and there's a whole bunch of other speculation (INAUDIBLE)  going to slow down growth and it will increase inflation, restricting  inward and outward FDI restriction to migration.  We don't have any  infrastructure plan and so on and so on.  In the end, it's going to slow  down and it's slowing down.  China is going to slow down --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you expecting the economy to fall apart when Donald Trump  was first elected?</p><p>ROUBINI:  No, I was not expecting to fall apart, no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But were you expecting things to lessen?  I mean, his economic  policies when you look at the tax cuts and the rolling back of regulation  has helped the economy.  I'm just trying to understand better why you see  this fiscal cliff happening next year?</p><p>ROUBINI:  Well, first of all, you know, the CBO that is independent  (INAUDIBLE) led by Republicans said the impact of a tax cut on potential  growth is going to be close to zero, 0.1 percent over 10 years, and it's  temporary.  You have a stimulus for the first two years, and the way it was  designed was to maximize the stimulus by the time of the midterm elections,  and then you're going to have a severe fiscal cliff because the way they  were designed was to be revenue neutral by the end of the decade, and  therefore, for two years, you have a massive stimulus.  If you look at the  data, one percent of GDP.  Then, you drag in 2020, and the drag becomes  actually severe drag by 2025.  That's the way it was designed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's on the other side of that train.</p><p>SMITH:  (INAUDIBLE) I want to clarify a couple of things.</p><p>ROUBINI:  Yes, the numbers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  Your rhetoric almost says depression, but you said recession.</p><p>ROUBINI:  Yes.</p><p>SMITH:  Isn't by definition most recessions pretty short and not that  severe?</p><p>ROUBINI:  Well, you know, this time around, I think the risk is that, if  and when we're going to have that recession, it might be as severe as the  previous one or could be worse, and it could be worse for two reasons: one  is that today, in the U.S. and globally, debt ratios are higher than they  were before the global financial crisis.  Debt ratio have gone globally,  private and public from 160 to 260 percent their GDP globally.  So, it's a  much more, bigger debt problem.  Debt servicing ratios are low because  interest rates are being low, but now the Fed is normalizing, other central  bank are normalized, so we've higher normal real rates and high debt  ratios.  We're going to see like corporate debt --</p><p>SMITH:  So, you're saying this recession could be worse than the previous  recession.</p><p>ROUBINI:  Could be.  And second factor is important (INAUDIBLE) to make a  point is that we're constraint in terms of policy tools.  We ran out of  policy bullets.  The headroom on policy rates is not going to be 600 basis  points, it's going to be at most 300.  Fiscal policy (INAUDIBLE) $2  trillion of debt and deficit even before the next recession, and the  political willingness to backstop and bailout banks, corporates, house --  it's going to be constraint, and some government (INAUDIBLE) so policy  (INAUDIBLE) being more constraints, debt ratios are higher, and financial  (INAUDIBLE) these are higher.</p><p>SMITH:  I agree, I think you've done fantastic research and your facts are  right, but didn't you say a lot of that stuff right before the bottom of  the market in 2009, that you said the worst was yet to come and we've had  one of the greatest rallies in the stock market in the last eight years,  and in the economy, and that's despite the restrictive policies that Obama  have.</p><p>ROUBINI:  I never predicted until now that there'll be another global  recession even when there was a risk of hard landing in China 2015, and '16  have said China (INAUDIBLE) policy tools when there were worries about the  (INAUDIBLE) in 2015, I said Greece is not going to exit the Eurozone.   Eurozone is not going to collapse.  So, this time around, when I look  ahead, I see 10 factors.  It's fiscal policy, it's monetary policy, it's  trade wars, it's other stagflationary policies by the U.S. administration,  slowdown in (INAUDIBLE), slowdown in China, slowdown in Europe, which  what's happening (INAUDIBLE) this morning with the Italy with (INAUDIBLE)  between the banks and otherwise, and we have (INAUDIBLE) asset prices,  nothing is cheap.  Public equities are not cheap, private equities are not  cheap, the real estate is not cheap, (INAUDIBLE) not cheap, (INAUDIBLE)  bonds are not cheap (INAUDIBLE) ratio is 50 percent above historical norms,  so we know they'll be a correction, and we know that there's illiquidity in  the market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROUBINI:  We also know that policy tools are constraint and we have more  debt.  So, I'm just saying --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The World Trade Organization -- the World Trade Organization is  cutting its outlook for global trade due to the increasing trade tensions  around the world, but this is because largely this tit-for-tat in trade.   But we had a guest on the other day, Dagen, who basically said the risk is  to the upside, as a result of these trade talks, right?  He was saying that  if President Trump gets a win with Europe, with Canada, with Japan, these  markets will rip.</p><p>ROUBINI:  Oh, there is that certainly possibility.  That is just a  negotiating ploy, art of the deal, but if I read what the U.S. is saying --  the U.S. -- if you read the new national security strategy of the U.S.,  they say China is strategic rival of the U.S., and if we let China, we  endanger the future, it's threat not just to our economic issue (INAUDIBLE)  also to our national security.  It's the containment of China strategy is  trade, is investment, is FDI, is technology, is joint ventures, it's across  the board.  This is a new cold war that this economic financial, political,  and geopolitical.  I think markets are underestimating that we are on a  collision course with China, and not just with China, I think this is an  administration that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we definitely -- we're having a (INAUDIBLE) with China.</p><p>ROUBINI:  -- buy American, hire American.  America first, make America  great again.  This is a protectionist administration.  (INAUDIBLE) is gone,  you have Peter Navarro, you have Lighthizer, you have the President, you  have the Wilbur Ross (INAUDIBLE) protection.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know how that leads -- but I don't know how that leads  to a recession.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>ROUBINI:  But I spoke about -- and other factors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you have.</p><p>ROUBINI:  In addition to it, there is also stagflationary (INAUDIBLE)  coming from trade, investment, migration that reduce growth and increase  inflation, and the Feds will have to hike more given the (INAUDIBLE)  shocks.</p><p>PEEK:  OK.  So, China actually has already slowed somewhat, but the United  States' GDP is 40 percent bigger than China.  It seems to me we are now  seeing for the first time, massive increases in sentiment which have led to  booming consumer spending and investment by corporations which we haven't  seen really in 10 years.  Seems to me that's a very forceful propellant for  the next couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of the rollback in regs.</p><p>ROUBINI:  It is -- it is (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what she said.</p><p>ROUBINI:  -- housing sector.  As we know, the tax plan makes the tax cuts  on the corporate permanent while after 2020, the tax rates on the household  gradually go higher and higher than they were before because they have to  pay for this 1.5 inflation to make sure that after the 10 year decade,  there's not going to be another deficit.  So, the way they did this is by  making permanent the tax for the corporate and making temporary the tax on  the housing sector.  (INAUDIBLE) short-term stimulus (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very quickly -- Nouriel, we got to -- we got to jump.  If the  recession happens in 2020, what happens to the stock market?  Very quickly.</p><p>ROUBINI:  I think that already by late part of 2019, asset price are  forward looking and they're going to sharply correct downwards, and it will  lead to recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much?</p><p>ROUBINI:  You know, in a typical risk (INAUDIBLE) last 10 years where it's  seven of them, markets were down 10 percent, they went up -- if you have an  (INAUDIBLE) it's a bear market, 20 percent or more, and if the recession  does --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From President Trump on the world stage to  fireworks on Capitol Hill, it has been quite the week.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I've loved every minute of it,  frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  I know.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's going to cap off today.  Let me take you back, Tuesday,  President Trump addresses the United Nations, an American President stands  up, America first.  Wednesday, an astonishing Presidential news conference,  never seen anything like it, rapid fire, direct answers to all questions,  it's clearly not the Obama-era, and then yesterday, the nation's glued to  the Kavanaugh hearings, standout moments, Dr. Ford says she's 100 percent  sure that it was Kavanaugh that did that event, 35 years ago.  The judge  himself defended himself and attacked the Democrats, then up came Lindsey  Graham with a blistering attack on the Democrats.  And today, rounding out  the week, the vote.  And it will probably take place during the three hours  of our show from 9:00 to noon.  I urge people to stay glued to the vote  today, on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  That's it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, we will be there, Stu!  We will see you in a few minutes,  thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his guests.   First though, coming up, rescue at sea, the harrowing pictures of a plane  crash-landing where everybody was able to walk away, next.  And then,  Carrie Underwood is back.  A sneak peak of the new \"House of Cards\"  trailer, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A powerful earthquake rocked Indonesia.  Lauren  Simonetti on headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, Maria.  A magnitude 7.5  quake destroyed many homes there.  It was centered off the island of  Sulawesi.  Authorities briefly issued a tsunami warning but that was later  lifted.  At least one death has been reported, but officials say this death  toll could rise.</p><p>And check this out, a passenger jet crashes into the water in Micronesia,  and a dozen of passengers, you can see them there, were rescued.  Officials  say the Boeing 737 crashed in a lagoon.  As it was landing, remarkably,  everybody was OK.  One survivor describing the scary landing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, PLANE CRASH SURVIVOR:  I thought we landed on -- until I  looked over and saw a hole in the side of the plane and water was coming  in.  I was really impressed with the locals, who immediately started coming  out in boats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He seemed so calm.  Investigators are trying to determine what  caused that crash.  Boeing landing a $9-billion contract with the Air  Force.  The company will build hundreds of new training jets to replace the  Air Force's current fleet which is more than 57 years old.  Meanwhile, Jeff  Bezos' Blue Origin has been tapped to supply engines for a joint venture  between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  This venture sends U.S. military and  spy satellites into outer space.  Take a look at shares of Boeing, up 24  percent.  Lockheed Martin shares down seven percent on the year.</p><p>And the trailer for the final season of Netflix's \"House of Cards\" is out,  and Claire Underwood has the power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLAIRE UNDERWOOD:  The reign of the middle-aged white man is over.  See  whatever Francis told you the last five years, don't believe a word of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I watched the whole thing and I had the chills.  Robin Wright's  character describes the tumultuous first 100 days as President, including  an assassination attempt against her, and the death of her onscreen husband  Frank Underwood, formerly played by Kevin Spacey.  And Spacey will be  completely absent from the season after allegations of sexual assault  against him.  Season six out November 2nd.  Netflix shares down half a  percent this morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  Coming up, final  thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Liz  peek?</p><p>PEEK:  Well, the market is down going into the weekend, but I think that  may just be a reflection of quarters and there's really no bad economic  news, still very, very strong.  I disagree with our guest, Nouriel Roudini.   I think the economy is in very good shape right now.  But I do think this  Elon Musk thing is the story of the day, really interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Aside from the Kavanaugh hearing.</p><p>PEEK:  Well, yes, of course.  Excusez-moi.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  Getting to that point, I think that's the most important day  politically since the Trump election.  I mean, I think things really bend  one way or another depending on what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of this vote at 9:30.</p><p>SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, the overall senate vote on Tuesday.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I cede my time to you, because I want to hear what you think  about the market.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH:  And then I talked about politics?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm like, come on, man.  Give me something here.  Are you  worried about Tesla in the --</p><p>SMITH:  I am worried about -- I'm worried about the SEC completely removing  the CEO from a public company and not allowing him to serve.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and hurting shareholders who believe in Elon Musk.</p><p>SMITH:  Exactly.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $50 billion market cap would fall below G.M. today.</p><p>PEEK:  But that's kind of a problem that he has been imbued with this sort  of cult-like following.  And if you look at the comments when someone says  maybe they have a cash flow problem, they are attacked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's amazing.  They sure are.  Anyway, have a great  weekend, everybody.  I'll see you on \"WALL STREET\" as well as \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  Here's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and Stuart.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

This, after he and  his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, told their stories yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let's go back to  the incident.

And joining us to break  it all down Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, along with Kadina Group president  Gary B. Smith, and \"The Hill\" columnist, Fox News contributor Liz Peek.   Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP:  Nice to be here.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a day yesterday.  We all watched.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the question going forward, we were talking about it in the  break, what are the consequences of Republicans voting no on Brett  Kavanaugh potentially.</p><p>To quote Kimberley Strassel's column in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"The  Kavanaugh Stakes\".  And I'll say this -- if a Republican votes against  Brett Kavanaugh you are standing with the sleeze on the left.  You're  standing by ambush tactics.  You're standing by the smears.  And it has  consequences not just for the man and his family but for the Supreme Court,  the Senate, and the country at large.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  I think this op-ed is so powerful  this morning from Kim Strassel.  And you're right.  She goes through it and  she basically says \"Any vote no, the stakes go even further to the core of  the country's principles.  To vote against Kavanaugh is to overthrow due  process.\"  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Overthrowing due process and essentially sending the message to  the country that an individual believes all men are liars and all women are  victims.  Nobody buys that.  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  Abandoning the presumption of innocence, which is sort of the  bedrock of our judiciary system and everything else.  I mean I think it's  an appalling approval of character assassination as sort of the first line  of defense.</p><p>This is all about the complexion of the court changing should Kavanaugh end  up on the Supreme Court.  It is not about what he did when he was a  teenager.  It's about basically losing an election in 2016 which allows  President Trump to appoint a conservative justice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly what Lindsey Graham said yesterday.  The Senator  said exactly what so many people were thinking.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, White House senior advisor for  strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp is here.  Revolution chairman  and CEO and former AOL CEO Steve Case is here.  Economist Nouriel Roubini  will join us.  And former White House press secretary under President  Trump, Sean Spicer is here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>And we kick it off right here -- an emotionally-charged day on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett  Kavanaugh publicly testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee over  sexual harassment allegations.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FORD:  Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life for a very long  time.  I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone these details.  It is  not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on  the Supreme Court.  My responsibility is to tell you the truth.  </p><p>LEAHY:  Then let's go back to the incident.  What is the strongest memory  you have?  </p><p>FORD:  Indelible in hippocampus is the laughter -- the uproarious laughter  between the two and they're having fun at my expense.  </p><p>SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  With what degree  of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  </p><p>FORD:  100 percent.  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I'm here today to tell the truth.  I've never sexually  assaulted anyone.  I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family.</p><p>The other night, Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little  Liza, all 10 years old said to Ashley we should pray for the woman -- a lot  of wisdom from a 10-year-old.  </p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Are Dr. Ford's  allegations true?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  They're not accurate as to me.  I have not questioned that she  might have been sexually assaulted at some point in her life by someone,  some place, but as to me, I've never done this.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Do you swear to God?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I swear to God.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This coming as Republican Senator Bob Corker says he will be  voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  We are waiting on  the others and that vote.  The committee vote is today at 9:30.</p><p>Joining us right now two New York representatives -- Republican  Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.   Congresswomen -- great to see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Thank you.  </p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Maloney -- I want to begin with you.  You waited  for Judge Kavanaugh's arrival yesterday with actress Alyssa Milano.  Why  were you with Alyssa Milano?  </p><p>MALONEY:  I went over to see the hearing.  She happened to be there.  At  first, Senator Feinstein said I had a ticket.  And then they moved to a  much smaller room.  She said I did not have a ticket.  There would be four  seats for members of Congress and I came very early to make sure that I had  one of those seats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She was recording the hearing.  Is that against rules?  </p><p>MALONEY:  I really don't know.  I did not know she was recording it.  But I  assume everywhere I go I'm being recorded now on these phones.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  She was -- </p><p>MALONEY:  And obviously she didn't have to record it.  You recorded it.   Everyone recorded it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You're not supposed to record it from inside the  courtroom, you know that, right?  You're a congresswoman.  She was asked to  stop and she did in fact comply.  </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, you should ask her about it.  I don't know anything about  it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the hearing yesterday?  </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I thought it was riveting.  And I thought Dr. Ford gave a  very sincere, honest, authentic testimony that was tremendously moving.   And Brett Kavanaugh also gave a very emotional testimony that was  incredibly partisan and attacking against Democrats.</p><p>Usually in these confirmation hearings they talk about the law, they talk  about working together for the future of the country.  It was a partisan  attack on -- the most partisan testimony I've ever heard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A partisan testimony on the Democrats' part?  </p><p>MALONEY:  On Judge Kavanaugh's part.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Tenney, your thoughts?  </p><p>TENNEY:  Look, I thought they were both very believable.  I thought that  she seemed to be sincere.  But I think this is really important.  It comes  down to credibility.  And I don't think taken as a whole the evidence  surrounding what brought her to the hearing in the first place was  credible. </p><p>I think that she -- if Senator Feinstein really cared about this woman and  sexual assault is a very, very serious issue.  As a lawyer I have  encountered this many times with many of my clients.  She would have  brought this immediately to law enforcement or the FBI to do an  investigation.  Instead, they held it.</p><p>So all of that moving testimony was really not credible and I respectfully  disagree with my colleague who is a terrific member of my committee, this  is -- Brett Kavanaugh is under attack.  His family is under attack.  He was  defending himself against some of the worst kind of accusations against a  person, dragging him through his high school days, a young man obviously  very well accomplished.  He's somebody who had a lot of fun but someone who  also, you know, was very, very smart, did really well, participated in all  kinds of sports and activities.</p><p>So I just thought it was a character assassination.  I felt that Mr.  Kavanaugh or Judge Kavanaugh was right to defend himself and his family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that your father was a New York Supreme Court  justice.  You were a lawyer who has previously represented sexual assault  victims so we wanted to get your take on that.</p><p>But I guess what strikes me is, Congresswoman Maloney, is the idea that you  say it was this partisan attack and yet Ford remains unable to marshal as  Kim Strassel writes, to marshal any evidence for her claim of sexual  assault.  There was no corroboration whatsoever of her claims of sexual  assault.  Did you not -- does that not strike you?  </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, first of all -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was there due process in this whole proceeding in your view?  </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, to answer your question, she originally wanted to be  anonymous.  That's why Senator Feinstein did not call for the FBI  investigation in the beginning.  But the minute that her identity became  public, both Senator Feinstein and Dr. Ford have called for and support an  FBI investigation. </p><p>There were a number of people there, according to her testimony, interview  them.  Let's have the FBI get together one set of facts, so that one set of  facts are before the committee.  And that is I think should be a  fundamental -- we shouldn't move forward without an FBI investigation on  her points and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  And I'd like to respond to what my friend and colleague has said  about the assault on Brett Kavanaugh.  Well, let's look at what she's  gained from this.  She's got death threats.  She's literally had to move  her family twice because of death threats.  She really hasn't gotten  anything out of this except for her belief in wanting integrity in the  process for the appointment to the Supreme Court -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MALONEY:  -- a lifetime appointment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She obviously truly believes that he was the one that did this  to her and obviously whatever she went through is just horrible.</p><p>But you mentioned Dianne Feinstein.  You know, she said she denied  releasing the information from the letter and yet the \"Washington Post\" got  the letter.  I mean hers is the only office who had the letter.  So it's  rich to say, you know, I can't believe that, you know, she wanted to be  anonymous and then all of a sudden she's not anonymous.  When in fact, yes,  she wanted to be anonymous but Feinstein's office sat on the letter for six  weeks and then the \"Washington Post\" suddenly got it.  </p><p>MALONEY:  But she was anonymous in her tip to the \"Washington Post\".  It  was the -- it came out -- somehow the press found out and were -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Somehow but the only person who had the letter  Feinstein's office so how somehow -- the press got it.  </p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I don't know how the press got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was leaked.  </p><p>MALONEY:  But I believe that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was leaked, probably by Feinstein's office. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  -- Feinstein was listening to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono's campaign is apologizing this morning.   She sent a fund raising e-mail during the Ford testimony, according to  published news reports.  The message reportedly said the money would be  donated to organizations helping survivors of sexual assault.  Your  thoughts on that -- Congresswoman?  </p><p>MALONEY:  She has apologized.  And I accept her apology.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole idea of throwing due process out the window before  anybody's allegations are corroborated -- Congresswoman Tenney, I wonder  what your thoughts are in terms of what -- how this is resonating with the  people.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Well, I certainly -- it's probably district by district.  But I  know I'm getting an overwhelming amount of concern on both sides about the  process.  And I don't disagree with my colleague, Representative Maloney.   I think it was a terrible thing for both of these people to go through.</p><p>And unfortunately, Dianne Feinstein is the person, obviously you could see  by the awkward moment in the testimony yesterday that, they probably did  leak the memo and that maybe will come out at some point.</p><p>And so unfortunately, both of them were dragged through this process.  And  I think it was interesting, and you played the clip where Judge Kavanaugh  recognized his own daughter feeling sympathy for Dr. Ford.  And I did too  when I was watching her.</p><p>I said as a woman and watching what she had been through -- but again, I go  back to the big point is this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TENNEY:  Was she believable?  Yes.  Was it credible the way this was all  put together? Do I believe she was probably a victim?  Probably.  Do I  believe it's Brett Kavanaugh?  I don't think so.  </p><p>And I hate to admit that I also kept calendars when I was in high school  and college because I was a very busy student as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TENNEY:  So this guy is an accomplished man.  He should be confirmed.  I  think this was a charade.  I think Lindsey Graham really highlighted it.  I  though he was the superstar last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There were a lot of funny tactics.  I think you would  both agree.</p><p>Carolyn Maloney -- </p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you.</p><p>TENNEY:  Well, I think we should have an FBI investigation and get to the  facts and then move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman -- thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much for joining us.  Both Claudia Tenney,  Carolyn Maloney -- great to see you both, ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Heartbreak in North Carolina, a body believed to be the missing six-year- old autistic boy has been found.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Tragic story --  Maria.</p><p>Search crews discovered the body of a child believed to be that missing  autistic boy, Maddox Ritch.  His body was found partially submerged in a  creek about a mile from where Maddox was reported missing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT HELTON, GASTONIA POLICE CHIEF:  I'm heartbroken.  This is not the  end that we had hoped for.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  His father says the six-year-old ran off last Saturday while  they were walking together in a park.  Investigators are working to find  out how the boy died, if there was any foul play involved.  That  investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Well, Audi's CEO reportedly on the verge of losing his job.  Volkswagen is  Audi's parent company and they're expected to fire Rupert Sadler as early  as today.  Sadler has been in jail since June over his alleged connections  to the diesel emissions cheating scandal that began three years ago.</p><p>Shares of Volkswagen -- not a good year them -- they're down about 13  percent.</p><p>And you don't have to worry about running out of Kentucky bourbon.  An  industry trade group says distilleries last year pumped out 7.5 million  barrels of aging whiskey.  That is the most since 1972.  But the good times  might be over.  An industry leader is warning that trade disputes in key  overseas markets could mean global customers start drinking less.  I guess  then prices go down, right.  We'll have more in the market.  </p><p>Cheers to them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up -- renewed trouble for Tesla.  The stock is down big today.  The  latest controversy for CEO Elon Musk as the Securities and Exchange  Commission files a lawsuit for fraud.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then, medical training goes high tech.  We're checking out the new robot  that can bleed, scream and cry -- later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>More turmoil for Tesla -- this is big.  The Securities and Exchange  Commission is suing Elon Musk for fraud over his tweet about taking the  company private at $420, funding secured.  The case raising questions about  executives using social media to get news out.</p><p>Joining me right now is Steve Case.  He is the chairman and CEO of  Revolution.  And he's the former CEO of AOL.  Steve -- it's great to see  you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, REVOLUTION:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a lot happening on Capitol Hill with some of your  colleagues in the business, speaking to lawmakers.</p><p>But first, let me get your reaction to what's happening with Elon Musk and  Tesla with this SEC lawsuit.</p><p>CASE:  Well Elon is obviously one of the great entrepreneurs of our  generation.  I have great respect for what he's been building with Tesla  and SpaceX and so many other things.  But I think -- and I obviously  support that CEOs should use social media and the Internet to reach out to  customers and other constituencies and, you know, kind of tell their  stories.  </p><p>But I do think there's a number of examples now where maybe Elon, by his  own admission, probably should get a little more sleep and probably should  be a little more careful before he tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean a lot of discussion this morning about what happens  to Tesla if Elon Musk is not there.  I mean he's, you know, being sued by  the SEC.  They're saying we are looking for him to not be able to serve as  the CEO of a public company.  Your thoughts on Tesla -- can it survive  without Elon Musk?  </p><p>CASE:  Well, I'm sure it could.  People said could Apple survive without  Steve jobs.  But clearly, Elon has been a key part of Tesla so hopefully  this is a bump in the road and over time they'll resolve this issue and  Elon will be able to kind of focus on taking Tesla and some of his other  companies to the next level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Steve -- let me switch gears and ask you about  Google on Capitol Hill today.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to meet with  top GOP lawmakers today.  You know, that this comes amid growing scrutiny  against the company and many social media sites for alleged biased search  results, violations of policy, renewed relationship with China as it  relates to Google specifically.</p><p>I spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday.  He'll be  meeting with Pichai today.  Here's what he tells me.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I mean he's committed  to coming to a hearing this year, which is a change of where Google has  been.  I'm concerned because 90 percent of all searches go through Google.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ninety percent.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And 95 percent of everybody drops off by that second page.   So that first page matters a lot.  Their real concerns are the conservative  voices being able to come across.  And I think transparency is key.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Steve?  Google is doing 90 percent of all  search.  </p><p>CASE: Obviously it's been a huge success.  We were early supporters when I  was running AOL.  We did a deal with Google at one point, I own about 5  percent of Google.  When it was a little company, it was just, you know,  Larry and Sergey and a few other people.</p><p>Now it's 100,000 employees and has a huge impact obviously globally, both  in terms of how people get information and also being a significant part of  the advertising market.  It's not surprising therefore that there's more  scrutiny, more attention. </p><p>I'm glad Google is going to be in Washington today to talk about what  they're doing.  And think about what the role of these big platforms is.   And as I say, it's not surprising that there's more of a backlash against  big tech or backlash against Silicon Valley.  I predicted it almost three  years ago.</p><p>I wrote the book, \"The Third Wave\" because as these platforms become bigger  and have more impact and in some cases -- in the face of Facebook maybe  even influence the election -- it's not surprising there's nor scrutiny.  I  think there will be more entrepreneurs in this third wave of the Internet  when you're dealing with health care and food and other smart cities.</p><p>Policies are going to matter more.  Regulations are going to matter more.   It's not just about the disruptive entrepreneurs going, you know, focusing  on technology in Silicon Valley.  It's also engaging in a respectful and  responsive way with the policy makers in Washington, Brussels and other  places.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's absolutely.  And therein lies the problem, right.   Because when you were talking about when you were an investor in Google, a  small company -- today as you say 100,000 employees, 90 percent of all  search results.  Do you feel a new tone in terms of the regulatory  environment that we could see perhaps calls for this company to be broken  up?  Or is this sort of the regular way the pendulum swings and you  remember what happened with Microsoft, when Microsoft was a real target  because of its size and its influence.  These companies are more powerful  today than ever before.  </p><p>CASE:  They are very powerful.  I was part of the whole Microsoft issue  when I was running AOL and some of the anti-trust issues.  I was even  deposed on that trial when the government was basically challenging  Microsoft.</p><p>At the time, they had something like 95 percent market share in operating  systems with Windows and there was a concern by the government which I  shared that they were doing some things that were not necessarily, you  know, supportive of entrepreneurs and others in the ecosystem in terms of  what they wanted to do to innovate.</p><p>Ultimately, you know, Microsoft decided to pull back.  It was a little bit  more careful, kind of self-regulated.  And I think I think that is the best  approach for these big companies, not just you know, Google but other  companies, Facebook and Amazon and so forth.</p><p>But if they don't do that, there's no question that there will be more  scrutiny.  I think there should be more scrutiny because these companies  are playing not just a significant role in our lives, and having a  significant influence on our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p>And now let's look at the AT&amp;TTime Warner merger.  Nine state attorneys  general are backing AT&amp;T as the Justice Department seeks to reverse the  approval of the company's $85.5 billion acquisition of Time Warner.  Your  take on this deal and its impact.  </p><p>CASE:  Well, obviously I have some history with Time Warner since we merged  AOL and Time Warner almost 20 years ago -- 19 years ago.  A lot has changed  since obviously.</p><p>I think the strategic logic of the deal, if they can figure out a way to  run it in a more integrated kind of way kind of makes sense.  I was a  little surprised when the merger closed and then, you know, the government  kind of filed this appeal.  I think it's better if these things are  resolved before things close as opposed to after things close.  But we'll  see how this stuff plays out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they should allow this to go through?  </p><p>CASE:  I think they probably should have decided earlier if they really  were going to have concerns about it.  I think once -- again, I don't know  all the details.  I've been focusing on working with entrepreneurs in the  middle of the country, not on thinking about what Time Warner and AT&amp;T  should be doing in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you about that --- Steve.</p><p>CASE:  But it seems like it should have been resolved earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you're leading the Rise of the Rest Summit.  This is a  nationwide an effort to invest in entrepreneurship; help build businesses  across the country.  This is really an important part of the employment  story in our country.  Entrepreneurs and small business create the jobs.   Tell us more about your effort.  </p><p>CASE:  It's very exciting.  We launched this Rise of the Rest initiative  over four years ago.  But today we're in Chicago.  Yesterday we had a  hundred entrepreneurs from 50 different cities that are doing amazing  things in sectors all across the economy.  We brought them together to  share perspective.  A half a dozen of our investors that are partners,  L.P.'s in the Rise of the Rest Fund, including Eric Schmidt, and you know,  the venture capitalist Jim Breyer of Silicon Valley, Dan Gilbert from  Detroit, Ted Leonsis from D.C., Brad Keywell from here and Chicago.   They're all sharing perspectives on scaling companies.  </p><p>We really believe the next wave of entrepreneurship is not going to just  happen on the coast, it's going to happen all across the country.  And you  said, that's critical.  Because the big job creators in our -- in our  country are the young, high growth startups.  And if we're only backing the  startups on the coast -- last year, 75 percent of venture capital went to  three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASE:  While the other 47 states fight over 25 percent.  So, big states  like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, get less than one percent.  </p><p>So, we need to back the entrepreneurs there, creating the jobs there to  offset the disruption of technology that's happening on the coast which  will continue to happen with A.I., robotics, driverless trucks.  They're  going to destroy jobs in the middle of the country if we don't offset that  at least in part by backing on entrepreneurs in the middle of the country  to create jobs in the middle of the country.  </p><p>That somewhat, some of the challenges we have right now including on the --  on the political front are going to worsen.  There are a lot of people in  this country -- the majority of the country by some estimates are anxious  and fearful of the future.  They don't view innovation as a good thing or  disruption as a good thing.  They view it as a bad thing.  It's going to  end up potentially destroying their jobs or their communities.  </p><p>So, we need to make sure we understand that startups play a critical role.   We need to level the playing field so everybody, everywhere really has a  shot at the American dream.  And we're creating jobs all across the  country, not just on the coast.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, you just say three states get the majority  of what, private equity?  </p><p>CASE:  75 percent -- venture capitalist.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Venture capital.</p><p>CASE:  If you look at the venture capital dollars, according to the NBC at  a Venture Capital Association last year 75 percent went to just three  states.  Actually, (INAUDIBLE) they cover --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.</p><p>CASE:  90 percent of the venture capital went to men, less than 10 percent  to women.  </p><p>So, we have some work to do to make sure we're backing every entrepreneur  everywhere.  That's what Rise the rest is all about, and these hundred  entrepreneurs.  It's really gratifying and exciting to hear their stories  yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>CASE:  -- when all these partisanship and all this you know, challenges in  the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASE:  The entrepreneurs are going to lead the way forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Steve Case, good to see you, sir.  </p><p>CASE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, September 28th.   Your top stories right now 07:35 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The testimonies are in.  Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and  his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testifying on Capitol Hill yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER:  The details that --  about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget.   They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an  adult.  </p><p>JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I swear  today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and  God, I am innocent of this charge.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote based on their  testimonies this morning at 9:30 a.m.  So far, we know that Republican  Senator Bob Corker has said he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh as did  Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>Futures this morning show the markets will open lower.  We are at the lows  of the morning right here, Dow Industrials down 90 points, that's a third  of a percent.  S&amp;P also down a third of a percent, as is the NASDAQ with a  decline of 30 points.  </p><p>These after the major indices finished higher yesterday.  As you can see,  gains across the board, NASDAQ best performer, up two thirds of a percent  yesterday, up 51 points.  </p><p>As we wrap up the third quarter, the DowIndustrials is up almost nine  percent for the quarter.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 up seven percent for  the third quarter.  Of course, the fourth quarter begins on Monday.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, the markets are lower.  Take a look.  FT-100 down  three quarters of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down better than one  percent.  And the DAX Index is down 1-2/3 percent right now.  </p><p>Asian markets finished mostly positive with the exception of Korea as you  can see.  </p><p>A terror plot was foiled overseas, we have the incredible footage of police  nabbing a group of terror suspects armed with suicide vests and assault  rifles.  </p><p>Plus, recall alert.  We've got the details on why Honda is recalling more  than 200,000 vehicles.  The malfunction that could put you in danger.  </p><p>And meet HAL, he's the incredible and realistic robot that's helping train  the next generation of medical professionals.  He'll be here in studio with  us in just a few minutes.  You've got to meet HAL.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p>But first, the top story this half an hour, meeting postponed.  The White  House announcing yesterday that President Trump will not be meeting with  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until next week.  This as fox is  just confirming conservative GOP leaders in the House have reached a deal  to bring in Rosenstein for a closed door session meeting to discuss the New  York Times story about potentially recording the president and invoking the  25th amendment to remove President Trump.  It is not clear, however, if  Rosenstein will respond to that congressional request.  </p><p>Joining us right now is former White House press secretary under President  Trump, Senior advisor and spokesperson for America First Action PAC and the  author of The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President, Sean  Spicer.  Sean, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, SENIOR ADVISOR AND SPOKESPERSON, AMERICA FIRST ACTION PAC:   You bet.  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your take on President Trump's meeting with his deputy attorney  general?  </p><p>SPICER:  I think it's an important meeting.  Obviously you need to make  sure that there's a chemistry and relationship and a degree of trust by  those you appoint and those are executing important duties throughout your  administration.  But the president rightly postponed this in light of the  other news that's going on with respect to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>But you know, look, I think that there's a lot about how this thing went  down in terms of the reporting of it, whether it was -- whether it happened  at all, whether it was a joke, an offended comment that was taken out of  context.  And I think the president needs to sit down as he's going to do  with Mr. Rosenstein and say explain yourself to me, what happened, what did  you mean, did it really happen?  And there's a lot of extremes that go into  that question.  Either it really didn't happen or it did happen.  And if it  did happen, was he joking around and you know, what was the context in  which it was said.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because there's more to it, right, Sean?  I mean, Rod  Rosenstein was the one who signed off on the third FISA warrant to wiretap  Carter Page.  He wrote a letter to fire Jim Comey and then was upset with  the president when the president said that's one of the reasons why he  fired him.  </p><p>And of course, he's been sitting on documents that congress wants to  investigate how they came up with this narrative that Trump had anything to  do with the Russia meddling.  </p><p>SPICER:  Right.  And I think I'll go back to what I said initially Maria,  which is, look, these are people that have been appointed by the president  of the United States to serve in his administration.  He was elected by the  American people.  And that if these people don't feel comfortable with the  policies and agenda that he has, then they have an obligation to resign.  </p><p>And so, I think the president needs to be able to look in this case Mr.  Rosenstein in the eye and say explain yourself to me.  If you're not doing  what I have asked you to do in terms of the Department of Justice and the  actions and policies that I want implemented, then you need to go.  You  should not be undermining me or opposing this agenda in any way, shape or  form.  And so, that's a conversation that the two of them need to have.  </p><p>But as you mentioned, all those aforementioned issues are important and I  think we need to make it clear, that these aren't independent agencies that  can go do whatever they want.  They are appointed to serve and execute the  policies and agenda of the president of the United States.  </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, its Liz Peek.  Good morning.  It does  seem to me that the president is somewhat boxed in.  In other words, this  has been an incredibly compromising news story about Rosenstein.  The  question is, if he gets rid of Rosenstein, who is next?  I mean, is there a  succession possibility here that's going to satisfy supporters of President  Trump?  </p><p>SPICER:  Well, I mean, obviously the president selects those individuals.   So, I don't know that they have a succession plan in place right now.  But  I'm sure that there's a ton of qualified individuals either within the  department that could be elevated and nominated to that position.  Noel  Francisco who's the number of the current Solicitor General I think by  statute and order would take over certain aspects of the job.  </p><p>But I think there's a fundamental threshold question that needs to get  asked first, which is, you know, whether or not the aspects of this New  York Times story were accurate in the first place.  So, I'm less worried  about the replacement than I am about the nut of the story.</p><p>And as I mentioned at the outset, I think there's a big difference between  whether it happened at all and then sort of the degrees, if it happened,  was its an offhanded joke that is trying to make Mr. Rosenstein look bad in  the eyes of the president knowing that something like this might tick him  off.  </p><p>So, I think first and foremost before we start talking about replacements,  we need to understand the context of the story and whether or not any of  the aspects are true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  We want to turn to the House Judiciary  Committee.  House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a subpoena for  the memos related to the former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the so  called McCabe memos, writing to attorney general Jeff Sessions this.  Given  the department's ongoing delays and or refusal to produce these documents,  I'm left with no choice but to issue the enclosed subpoena to compel their  production.  </p><p>What effect is this going to have do you think -- we've seen subpoenas  before.  Are we going to see these memos?  </p><p>SPICER:  Well, I hope so.  We're not talking about necessarily putting them  in the public domain.  But the members have a right, a constitutional right  to oversight and the idea that a Republican House is being stymied by a  Republican run Department of Justice --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  -- is mind boggling.  So, I don't know why it's taking Chairman  Goodlatte to go to the length of a subpoena.  They should be able to come  to terms privately and meet in closed session, or however -- you know,  whatever form is appropriate to review these things.  But this is somewhat  out of -- out of norm that you have the same party having this discussion.   So I think it's -- I would behoove the Department of Justice to work with  Chairman Goodlatte and the Republican leadership in the House to satisfy  this requests.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Maybe they just don't want to see what's in these memos,  right?  Because what did Trey Gowdy say Dagen, that it's an embarrassment  because we're going to actually see how they came up with this idea that  Trump had anything to do with the Russia scandal. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  An embarrassment to John  Brennan.  (INAUDIBLE) And he didn't think that there was anything new in  there for the most part.  That's not going to be any great shockers in the  memos.  </p><p>SPICER:  And the thing -- the other thing that I would add in this is that,  for all these people who constantly are crying about transparency, here we  have another instance of trying to get more information to understand  what's going on and it seems that so many people are actually trying to  prevent us from having a greater understanding of what's really going on.   For all the people who care about Russia and this collusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, here's another way to find out what's the basis of this,  what is that information.  We're not -- again, we're not talking about  putting it out publicly.  It's members of Congress exercising their  constitutional responsibility.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, and this speaks volumes, doesn't it?  </p><p>SPICER:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sean, thank you so much. </p><p>SPICER:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sean Spicer joining us.</p><p>Coming up, a major terror plot was foiled.  The developments after police  in the Netherlands arrest seven suspects.  </p><p>Then, a huge recall for Honda to report.  Details on the automakers  malfunctions software in certain vehicles.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get this, police in the Netherlands foiling a major terrorist  plot.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this as an amazing  video and it shows the dramatic moment Maria, when heavily armed Dutch  police, check this out, they arrested terrorists suspects in a raid in a  parking lot.  Authorities say there were seven men who planned to use  suicide vests, assault rifles and car bombs targeting at least two  locations.  Fortunately that attack foiled.  About 400 officers took part  in a series of raids.  There they are.  The alleged ring leader of 34 old  Iraqi was previously convicted of attempting to travel overseas to join  extremist groups.  </p><p>Well, a recall from Honda this morning, about 232,000 2018 Accords and 2019  Insight hybrid in the U.S. could have a software problem.  The rear camera  display doesn't work when the cars are put into reverse.  Honda says there  have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to this potential  problem.  Shares of the company down 11 percent this year.  </p><p>And we are getting the first glimpse of Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers for the  upcoming movie about the beloved children's show host.  Looks pretty good.   The photo Sony has released shows a gray haired hanks in Rogers signature  red sweater.  That was the sweater he wore on Mr. Rogers neighborhood.  The  film will follow the story of a reporter who developed an emotional bond  with Rogers while profiling him for a magazine.  Production started this  month.  It hits theaters next October.  I loved that show growing up, that  red sweater, I forgot all about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  Taking the shoes off.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming  up, talk about a realistic robot.  Check this out, we got details on a new  machine that can bleed, scream and cry and HAL the robot is in studio.   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The future of medical training may be in the hands of robots.   Gaumard Scientific has created HAL, a realistic child robot for medical  training that can cry, bleed and react like a real child patient.  We have  HAL here on the set today.  </p><p>And joining me right now is Gaumard Scientific corporate planning vice  president James Archetto and Dr.  Mikhail Varshavski also known as Dr.  Mike.  Great to see everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>James, let me start with you.  Tell us about HAL and what was the  inspiration for creating HAL?  </p><p>JAMES ARCHETTO, CORPORATE PLANNING VICE PRESIDENT, GAUMARD SCIENTIFIC:  HAL  is really designed Maria for training physicians, nurses, first responders.   What we want is physicians and health care practitioners to really be  prepared for those critical situations with patients before they ever get  there.  So this is a chance for them to really learn a clinically accurate  patient.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how does HAL do that?  </p><p>ARCHETTO:  HAL does that by the combination of electronics, software and  hydraulics inside.  So you can see his eyes are moving now.  He has facial  expressions.  </p><p>And the reason for that, is physicians get a lot of information from that  and 5-year-olds don't always talk and don't always provide that information  verbally.  So, we had to do it in a way with several motors and electronics  and software.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Mike, you're a practicing doctor.  We're seeing the video  of HAL getting blood taken from him.  </p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE:  Yes, I mean, when I  was training we didn't have simulations this real.  We had a basic dummy  that didn't move.  And you'd be doing chest compressions, he's best you  would hear a click to know that you were doing chest compressions in the  right way.  Here, it sounds like you have the entire picture.  You have the  emotional feedback.  You have visual feedback.  You can do procedures on  him.  </p><p>And when you -- I know, you mentioned earlier in one of the segments that  you don't want him to look too realistic.  Because you were worried about  being traumatic to medical students.  What was traumatic to me as a medical  student was going into my first surgery rotation and not knowing what to do  because I didn't have experience on such a high level simulator.  </p><p>So, having this experience, knowing how to do the procedures, being able to  look at a child and seeing it react back and forth with me, that's  priceless.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How will you react, though?  I mean, James, walk us through  some of the medical scenarios that HAL can actually replicate.  </p><p>ARCHETTO:  Sure.  Let's say that a child goes into respiratory distress,  asthmatic on a plain field.  For example, playing soccer goes in -- has an  asthmatic attack, goes into respiratory distress.  HAL will respond  appropriately to that.  He can actually be intubated to help him breathe.   If he goes into cardiac arrest, he can be defibrillated with real energy.  </p><p>So, as Dr. Mike was describing, those real clinical experiences can take  place right here on HAL.  And you know, so, I'm controlling him from a  tablet here.  He's not plugged in.  He's completely untethered Maria  because accidents take place wherever not always in the hospital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this would be helpful to you?  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So, this would be helpful to everybody.  Because we're talking  about nurses, we're talking about first responders, we're talking about  training physicians.  And in reality, you never know what to expect in the  situations.  So, the more simulations you can be put in as a trainee, the  better you're going to react when the time comes to make a decision.  </p><p>Because it's really traumatic in the scene of an injury, in the scene of  someone having an asthma attack, your mind starts racing.  And if you don't  have experience with a simulated patient before that, it makes it really  hard to make the right decision.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the downside risk here, James?  I mean, I understand the  benefits of having HAL as you very articulately -- as you very articulated  it, but is there a downside here?  I mean, robots are getting better and  better and better.  </p><p>ARCHETTO:  Yes, remember, his objective is training.  He's an educational  aide to facilitate folks like Dr. Mike in their training experience.  So  from that standpoint, the objective is to really focus on those clinical  experiences.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, the hair is really amazing.  Look at this.  This is great.   Great stuff, guys.  Thanks very much, James Archetto, Dr.  Mike, great -- a  pleasure.  Thank you, HAL. </p><p>ARCHETTO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.

What a great day to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a great day to be here after such an incredible day  yesterday.  Riveting.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Riveting.  I think you'd have to  say all the news is -- not only yesterday but then you throw in some of the  businesses like the SEC allegations, it's interesting times.</p><p>PEEK:  And the loss is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were expecting something to happen with Elon Musk givn the  lat couple of months there.</p><p>SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the hearing, you and I spoke about this yesterday.  We  wanted to text during it, we were both glued to it.  Your reaction Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, ANCHOR:  Here was a man who defended  himself with passion, with force, with emotion, and even at times some  anger rightfully so.</p><p>This is a man wrongfully accused and he was outraged by his treat -- the  treatment that he's received by the democrats and coordinated smear  campaign, a coordinated character assassination.  And he was angry for  himself, his career, his reputation destroyed, and he was angry for his  family rightfully so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of the best -- one of the best moments, speaking of his  family, was when he spoke of his daughter, his 10-year-old daughter who  said --</p><p>PEEK:  Praying for Dr. Ford which is an extraordinary concept and good for  him.  I mean, it made it so human it seems to me.  And so -- and, you know,  one of the things we've heard about him all along with how open-minded he  is, he -- this is to all different points of view and so forth on the  bench.</p><p>And I thought that was sort of -- this is another indication that this is a  man who really does entertain a wide spectrum of beliefs and commentary and  so forth for him to have talked to his children about her accusations in a  way that persuaded them to pray for her which is extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of her accusations, Christine Blasey-Ford's testimony  was gripping to say the least.  Nevertheless, we come out of this hearing  with no corroboration of her allegations and no supporting evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even by all -- we have a new letter from Mark Judge that says  that, \"I have no knowledge of this party.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He sent another letter to the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the four people who she talked about being with her  including her best friend, this woman Leland also said they do not remember  what she's talking about.  I mean, it was just extraordinary.  And leading  up to yesterday's testimony, it truly was a sad day for America as people  threw out due process altogether.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lindsey Graham had one of the brightest shining moments in  political history --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He really did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in modern political history yesterday because he spoke for  how -- so many Americans and how they feel with characteristic, bluntness,  and fire of a southerner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's show some of that right now.  We've got a great  show coming up.  Joining the conversation, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communication, Mercedes Schlapp is with us.  House Financial  Services Committee Members, Republican and Democratic New York  Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p>The CEO of Delta Airlines will join me, Ed Bastian is here, along with  former AOL CEO, Revolution Chairman and CEO Steve Case.  Plus, Economist  Nouriel Roubini will navigate the economy for us and assess where we are in  terms of this strong performance.</p><p>First though our top story right here and that is emotions running high on  Capitol Hill yesterday, Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his  accuser Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford testifying before the Senate Judiciary  Committee offering drastically different accounts during the high-stakes  hearing, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FORD:  I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I would  like to.  But the details that -- about that night that bring me here today  are the ones I will never forget.  They have been seared into my memory and  have haunted me episodically as an adult.</p><p>Indelible in the (INAUDIBLE) campus is the laughter, the laugh -- the  uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense.  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Dr. Ford, to what degree of certainty do  you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  </p><p>FORD:  One hundred percent.  </p><p>DURBIN:  One hundred percent.</p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Less than two weeks ago Dr. Ford publicly accused me of  committing wrong doing at an event more than 36 years ago when we were both  in high school.  I denied the allegation immediately, categorically, and  unequivocally.</p><p>This confirmation process has become a national disgrace, the constitution  gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process.  But you  have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.  This whole two- week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled  with apparent pen up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.</p><p>Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on  behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars and money from outside left  wing opposition groups.  This is a circus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And after all of that the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote  today at 9:30a.m.  Here now Criminal Defense Attorney, former Sex Crimes  Prosecutor, Nichole DeBorde.  Nicole, thanks very much for being here, your  take from a legal perspective this morning.</p><p>NICOLE DEBORDE, ATTORNEY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE:  You know, I think one of the  big issues here is that this very sort of accusation goes on in courtrooms  across America and certainly in my jurisdiction on a daily basis based on  the word of one individual with no corroborating evidence whatsoever.</p><p>And there are men and women, there are people in prison over the word of  one person and it may be time to rethink how we -- how we see these cases  and how we handle evidence presented in these cases?  At the end of the  day, whatever happens in this vote this morning, Judge Kavanaugh is going  to go home to his family.  There are many people in this exact same  circumstance who are just not so fortunate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, yesterday the Sex Prosecutor Mitchell painted a  picture and interviewed Dr. Ford in a way that really brought out some  important issues about her whether it was she had a lot of memory lapses.</p><p>She said initially she was afraid to fly and then she had all of these  trips that she had gone on, from Indonesia, to California, Hawaii.  She  also couldn't remember some important things like how she got to the party  and how she left.  What was your take on Mitchell's performance before  Senator Lindsey Graham really put a -- put a point to everything?</p><p>DEBORDE:  I thought that it was a -- it was a very smart move to have her  do the questioning.  She clearly was a very experienced questioner, knew  the types of issues that would concern people.  Knew how to address all  kinds of things related to memory, detail, you know, facts surrounding the  main allegation that was made that I think help shed light on, you know,  answers to questions that will help people determine her credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm going to bring you the panel in a moment.  But let's  get to Lindsey Graham for a moment because he said yesterday what many  people were thinking.  Here's Lindsey Graham lashing out pointing his anger  squarely at democrats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  What you  want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this open and hope you win in  2020, you said that.  When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that  Lindsey said hello because I voted for them.  I would never do to them what  you've done to this guy.  This is the most unethical sham since I've been  in politics. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for the senator.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He spoke for a lot of people in this country --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He sure did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- who is angry at the treatment, the coordinated attack by the  democrats and angry.  And by the way, people were chastising Brett  Kavanaugh for his anger, if I was sitting in that seat and I have been  treated that way, I would have gone yards and miles further than what he  did.  </p><p>I would have been pointing -- but Brett Kavanaugh did a smart thing  yesterday because he had those democrats beginning with Dianne Feinstein  back on her heels.  It -- their one line -- their one talking point  yesterday was let the FBI investigate this, let the FBI investigate this in  between quizzing Brett Kavanaugh about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More delay.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drinking games in his high school yearbook.  So that raises  the question.  Dianne Feinstein have this letter in late July, she sat down  with Brett Kavanaugh --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investigate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- on August the 20th.  If they had immediately taken this  information to Chuck Grassley and to the republicans on Judiciary  Committee, they could have done a lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They didn't want to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that raises the question.  She denied leaking it, she denied  leaking the letter or and -- people on her staff.  But, again, why did they  sit on it?  We know why, to delay it past the midterms and that was crystal  clear yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p>PEEK:  Well -- and also I think the republicans did a good job.  They all  did a good job of making it seem like a political hit job.  And to your  point, not only did they delay that and not have an investigation into the  letter, there were -- they had any number of opportunities to question  Kavanaugh about some of these things and they failed to do so.</p><p>So I think what -- what's interesting to me is the change and sentiment if  you measure it by the odds of his confirmation, various betting sites it  went from 100 percent he's not going to get confirmed to by the time he was  finished and the time some -- and Lindsey Graham spoke it was like, yes,  he's going to go through it 57 percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They kept -- the democrats kept pushing Chuck Grassley on  bringing these witnesses who can -- who do not corroborate Christine  Blasey-Ford's story in front of the committee to hear from them publicly.</p><p>We have a new letter from FOX News from Mark Judge that was sent to  Grassley and Dianne Feinstein.  He said, \"As a recovering alcoholic and a  cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety.  As a  result, I have to wait to speak public speaking.\"  </p><p>And he said, \"Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school.  We have  not spoken directly in several years.  I do not recall the events described  by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee today.  I never  saw Brett act in a manner Dr. Ford describes.  I am knowingly submitting  this letter under penalty of felony.\"  To put an exclamation point on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There is no corroboration of this woman's story.</p><p>PEEK:  And by the way, the other witnesses also had letters that were under  penalty of perjury.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>PEEK:  I mean, these were serious affidavit that this did not happen or  they -- at least they do not remember.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And all the so-called bystanders which then she had to change  to say, \"Oh no, he was downstairs, he actually wasn't a bystander.\"  Said,  \"I have no knowledge of any of this.\"  </p><p>Nicole, let's get to the vote today, do -- what do you think happens today  at the vote?  Do they have the vote at 9:30 as we're expecting in the  committee?</p><p>DEBORDE:  I think they do have the vote.  And I think that it's -- you  know, after this vote is had I think it's time to start having some real  serious discussions about how we handle these cases in a criminal court  setting.</p><p>This is a person who had an opportunity to come out and tell her story just  like she was in a court of law and we can see now very publicly what kind  of damage that can do when you don't have any physical evidence whatsoever.   And people are in prison, like I said all over this country for exactly the  same thing without a similar public forum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So very quickly, we'll see a vote in the Committee at 9:30, do  you -- then is the timeline that then we'll see the big vote for the Senate  on Tuesday?  And do you think he gets confirmed?  Very quickly.</p><p>DEBORDE:  You know, that's hard for me to guess, you know, I have my doubts  at this point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Thank you so much Nicole.  Good to see you.  The president  also has tweeted out support for the nominee saying this, \"Judge Kavanaugh  showed America exactly why I nominated him, his testimony was powerful,  honest, and riveting.\"</p><p>\"Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has  been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist, the Senate  must vote.\"  Thanks very much for joining us, we appreciate it.  We will  see you soon.</p><p>Coming up, Elon Musk in the SEC cross hairs, Tesla stock is plummeting this  morning, the agency brings a suit against Elon Musk.

Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk is under fire this morning, the  Securities and Exchange Commission laying out the details of its lawsuit  against the CEO of Tesla.  It all stands for Musk's tweet last month  alleging he secured funding to take Tesla private.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today, the SEC filed securities fraud charges against  Elon Musk.  The chairman and CEO of Tesla Motors stemming from his August  2018 statements decimated over tweeter that he was considering taking Tesla  private.\"</p><p>\"We alleged that Musk's statements were false and misleading because they  lack any business and facts. The SEC's complaint which was filed earlier  today in federal district of New York seeks a finding that Musk committed  security (INAUDIBLE).  And injunction prohibiting him from doing so in the  future, civil penalties, discouragement of any ill-gotten gains and a bar  prohibiting Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company  in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Musk has refunded in the lawsuit in a statement he said this,  \"This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened disappointed.   I've always taken across and the best of truth transparency and investors.   Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I  never compromise this in any way.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is the Wall Street Journal's Technology and Autos  Reporter, Tim Higgins.  Tim, thanks very much weighing in.  Your reaction  to this, is this the beginning of the end for Elon Musk?</p><p>TIM HIGGINS, TECHNOLOGY &amp; AUTO REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well  surprising how quickly the SEC moved on this.  These things usually take,  you know, months if not years.  Here, they are out, you know, weeks  afterwards really suggest that it's -- to them an open and shut case.  You  know, it could spell some trouble for Tesla really without Elon Musk at the  -- at the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's what I'm going to ask you about.  But first, let  me get your reaction Gary.</p><p>SMITH:  Well there's two takeaways, one is normally the SEC settles these  things far beyond far ahead of the actions like this.  two, I'll ask Tim, I  think if a mosque is removed that it destroys Tesla, what are your  thoughts.</p><p>DEBORDE:  That's a -- that's a good question.  They -- you know, there's  not a lot of companies where the CEO the brand are so intertwined, how  you've seen the stock has swore in recent years and that's a large part  because of investor enthusiasm for Elon Musk's vision of the future,  personal transportation.</p><p>So not having Elon Musk there could spell, you know , some trouble for them  raising funds, they need to probably raise some money.  You know, are  people going to be as excited to be in that stock?  Are they going to be as  excited to be buying the cars?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stock is down 10 percent Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tim, and it raises an issue in terms of the SEC is looking to  bar Elon Musk from being a -- its top executive from serving as an officer  or director of any U.S. public company.  It raises the issue of the SEC is  in a position where they're going to wipe out potentially the shareholder - - $50 billion in shareholder value.</p><p>When they do (INAUDIBLE) a little to actually protect small individual  investors, they have to think about that and maybe Elon Musk is looking at  say, Mark Cuban saying, \"I could fight this, clear my name.  I'm not  settling.\"</p><p>HIGGINS:  Yes.  And in a lot of ways this is almost classic Elon Musk.  He  likes to pushback when he feels like he's wrong.  We reported that perhaps  there was a negotiation for a settlement that the SEC thought they had and  then Elon's lawyers called them and said, \"No, we're going to -- we're not  going to go that route.\"</p><p>If you look at his statements following that tweet in August and since then  he is really been making the case and in his mind e thought the funding was  there.  Of course, the SEC is saying not so fast but it really gets to this  kind of the way Silicon Valley is operating.</p><p>You know, to be an entrepreneur like him, he has to kind of create his own  reality.  You know, he was told for many years he couldn't make electric  cars cool, he's been able to do that.  And we've seen him in recent years  really pushback against regulators and, you know, let them do -- let him do  the things he wants to do.</p><p>PEEK:  Tim, it's Liz Peek.  Good morning.  What do you think about the  succession issue here?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Well that's a -- that's a -- it's a huge question.  You know,  basically the last two years or so it seen a huge exodus of top executives  from the company, it's not an easy place to work.  In recent months we've  seen the top sales executive and the top -- and the engineering chief  leave.</p><p>These are people that would have been maybe perhaps natural number twos, or  people that could take the -- take the wheel if you will.  But now they're  gone and if the bench is not very deep.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way you just said he said he  believe when he did  the tweet that he had the funding, are you saying you believe the funding  at $420 a share or was that some kind of a joke?</p><p>HIGGINS:  Well, you know, he -- the complaints that we read there he  basically said, well I got to do a premium on where the stock is, it's  going to be at $419, you know, $420 that would be funny, maybe that would  impress his girlfriend.</p><p>You know, in previous blog posts that he's put out, he's essentially made  the case that, \"Hey, had some meetings with the Saudi, of the Southern  wealth fund.  He thought that they wanted to help them take the company  private, he could get something done.  But, yes, the SEC is basically  saying, \"Hey, you didn't have this like locked in.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, of course.  Tim, thanks very much for weighing in, we  appreciate it.  We sort of saw this coming, we reacted this way as soon as  that tweet came out on this program I remember.  Tim Higgins, thank you,  from the Wall Street Journal.  </p><p>Coming up, price to win, Boeing snagging a multibillion dollar Air Force  contact, we'll tell you all about it when we come back.</p><p>And then technology transforms the way you travel, I'm sitting down with  the CEO of Delta Airlines, Edward Bastian is here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Already, we know, that Bob  Corker said he will vote yes for Kavanagh.</p><p>Futures this morning, show the markets will open lower, Dow Industrials  down 75 points, that's almost a third of a percent lower, S&amp;P 500 down  seven points, and the NASDAQ up 20 points, a quarter of a percent lower.</p><p>This after the markets were higher yesterday, Dow Industrials picking up 50  points at the close, 54 points higher, a quarter of a percent.

We have the adorable video,  coming up, right here.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, technology transforming travel,  Delta Air Lines is preparing to launch the first biometric terminal in the  country.  Certain terminals at the Atlanta International Airport will be  equipped with facial recognition technology from curb to gate, expected to  become fully operational later this year.</p><p>Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive interview with the CEO of  Delta Air Lines, Edward Bastian, Edward, it's great to see you, thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>EDWARD BASTIAN, CEO, DELTA AIR LINES:  Thanks, Maria.  It's great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really exciting stuff.  Tell me what you are expecting  and how this will work.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Well, yes, we've transformed many parts of the travel experience  for customers' stay, but the area that I think needs the most assistance  right now is the airports, the airport environment going through security,  with the gate and boarding process.</p><p>And we've been partnered with CBP, Customs and Border Patrol, to create a  frictionless, paperless entry process, both, as you exit the country and as  you -- as you return to the country for international travel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, this facial recognition has been successful for  government because they are catching illegals coming in, as well.</p><p>BASTIAN:  It's incredibly effective.  It's the most efficient technology  we've seen from a secure perspective and it also speeds the access through  the airport quite quickly.  It's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As you incorporate more technology into operations, what are  the cost looking like?  Is this going to impact expenses in a big way, next  year?</p><p>BASTIAN:  It's not.  You know, we are investing heavily in technology  because we are driving a lot of customer improvement, enhancements.  It is  driving revenue performance.  It's driving some productivity enhancements.   But, you know, a lot of this we are talking about now is basic  infrastructure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The company has been doing so well.  Where does the growth come  from out five years?</p><p>BASTIAN:  Out five years, I think, it's going to be global.  For the last  few years, we focus largely on the U.S. marketplace, New York, L.A.,  Seattle, the coasts on both sides, international has been a little more  challenging and it's good to see that demand is really strong, this year,  international, as well as domestic.</p><p>And we've been growing internationally, all year, and I think the outlook  for international growth is going to be quite promising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I was taking with the CEO of Boeing, about the  same topic, and he said a large percentage of the people in the world have  never been on a plane.</p><p>BASTIAN:  The U.S. marketplace is largely mature for air travel, you know,  there's a lot new places to fly.  We're building bigger airplanes and  bigger airports, but not new markets to travel to.</p><p>So, the opportunity whether to Asia, Latin America, even into Europe, I  think, is going to be the future and Africa, as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's terrific, very exciting.  So, the growth story  will still be the U.S., but also incorporate a lot more potential  international.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Yes, the U.S. is always our home market, two-thirds of our  revenue is in the majority of our profits are here in the U.S.  But long- term, I'm thinking 5 years, I'm thinking 10, 20, 30 years from now.  It's  going to be international.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's terrific.  Tell me about the changes you're making to  the fleet, this is also important, a lot of analysts, talking about this as  the major growth proposal, as well.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Right.  With all the infrastructure constraints we have in the  U.S., air traffic control and some of the other congestion issues, one of  our strategies is to the deal with that is to build some larger airplanes  so that we're not -- we don't have as much friction in the sky.</p><p>And so, you need larger airplanes, larger airports, but it's not going to  be, you know, the air traffic control systems that we need built, are  probably years away, in terms of being able to accommodate more travelers.   There are no new landing slots here in LaGuardia or JFK.  They're already  at maximum capacity.</p><p>So, we need bigger capacity, and that's why we're putting bigger planes on  our markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's more comfortable for passengers, as well, by the way.</p><p>BASTIAN:  It's more comfortable, it's more fuel-efficient, it's more fuel  effective, from an environmental perspective.  The new planes that we're  bringing in are about 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the planes that  we're retiring.  And it's a much better experience all around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how does that jive with what you have in terms of the  airports right now?  I mean, you look overseas, you've got beautiful, large  airports, and then, like, you mentioned JFK and LaGuardia.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will they be able to accommodate these larger planes?</p><p>BASTIAN:  They will.  We're investing in the airports, as well.  We've got  the biggest investment project in our history, going on right now at  LaGuardia Airport.  It is $3-1/2 billion rebuild of LaGuardia.  It's going  to take several years to get done.  We're going to be opening the first  concourse in the next 18 months.</p><p>So, it's not that far away.  But we have similar projects going in L.A.   We're building a brand new airport, LAX, new international facility in  Seattle, brand new airport in Salt Lake City.  We've just completed a big  modernization in Atlanta.</p><p>So, $12 billion of airport infrastructure that Delta is putting in, in  place, in the U.S. and, you know, five years from now, I think we're going  to have some great airports.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fantastic because -- and that infrastructure move could  be a partnership government, as well as private sector, right?</p><p>BASTIAN:  We do work effectively -- with our -- with our municipalities,  with our local governments, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, earlier this week, the House passed legislation  that would establish a minimum standard for a leg room on commercial  flights.  The Bill now moves to the Senate.  If it passes in the Senate,  how would the changes impact Delta?  Because it seems like you are doing  exactly what they are just talking about in Washington.</p><p>BASTIAN:  We are doing exactly what they're talking about.  And we're no  concerned.  It's -- the FAA Bill is instructed the DOT to look after the  safety, relative to seat pitch of the airlines.  We're confident that our  airplanes -- because we haven't touched our seat pitch in years.</p><p>At Delta, our product standards have -- are not being compromised.  We  don't think it's going to be an issue for Delta, and I doubt it's going to  be an issue for the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  All good news here, and yet, just recently, your  experience, a tough day, now you have a technical glitch, caused a  nationwide grounding on Tuesday.  There were only three cancellations,  amazingly.</p><p>Delta had to delay more than 660 flights, though, according to FlightAware.   A lot of people were talking about how the Delta folks really responded  well bringing Dunkin' Donuts to people, helping them get through it.   Nobody likes travel, hell.  But tell us what happened that day and how the  firm responded.</p><p>BASTIAN:  We had a glitch in some of our departure technology that allows  us to push our planes back from the gate.  It caused about a 30-minute  ground stop for systems, so it did cause some disruption, as you say, it  was minimal, relative to cancellations and as well as delays.</p><p>You know, one of the things that we've been investing also and heavily, is  technology and infrastructure, and the ability to respond when we have some  of these glitches, if technologies are like flood, and we've got to create  continued improvement there to improve the processing.</p><p>But one of the things I was most proud of, is when you look at our  performance that day, relative to our major competitors, we still  outperformed our major competitors even with that small glitch, so team did  a great job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They seem to have done a great job, you're right.  I mean, you  -- this is the way of life, you're going to have glitches in the airline  business, right?</p><p>BASTIAN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's about how you respond to it.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Yes.  I would have said several years ago, that could have been  two, three, four hours to respond, to get it done.  We got it done  actually, in 26 minutes.  It was pretty -- it was pretty quick.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that when I am on a Delta flight, there you are in  the video.  I mean, you are right, front and center.  You want the  employees, as well as the customers to know the buck stops with you.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you your take on what we're talking about in  terms of the intersection of business and social media.  We got this  growing number of CEOs turning to the online platforms, most recently, the  CEO of Tesla, obviously, with this tweet.</p><p>Now, the SCC is looking into it and actually bringing a lawsuit.  What's  your take on going that far in terms of tweeting, as a CEO of a public  company?</p><p>BASTIAN:  Well, I don't tweet.  That's one of the things I have stayed  away, though, I am on social media.  You know, I think today's customers  and especially the next generation of customers, look for leadership, and  they're looking for leadership in Washington.  They're looking for  leadership from their products, from the companies, and services that they  buy from.</p><p>And I don't think you can avoid being visible, as you say, you have  customers want to know where you stand on issues that affect your business  and affects your employees, and sometimes you have to take -- come out and  take a stand, but we try to be careful with where we position ourselves,  because the brand is incredibly important to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's all you have.  You got your reputation.  Let me end on  the backdrop in terms of the climate today.  Ed, how do bookings look, what  are you expecting in terms of the economy going into 2019?</p><p>BASTIAN:  We are very optimistic.  We just finished the strongest summer  travel season in our history.  We expect to carry 200 million passengers  this year, largest in our history, and the (INAUDIBLE) is quite positive.   And the good thing, Maria, it's not just U.S. international.  It's also  business and leisure, so all sectors of our business are performing very,  very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting to raise prices as a result of oil prices  are?</p><p>BASTIAN:  Well, you have to cover the cost and all prices have been a  significant increase for us, so we are looking at about $2 billion-dollar  or higher fuel bill this year, than last year.  But despite that, our  overall profit level for this year is going to be roughly the same as it  was last year.</p><p>So, we've been able to cover the cost in various ways, some price increases  have gone into effect, but also a lot of productivity and a lot of  improvements in our network that's also allowed us to drive that  efficiency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe this narrative that the broad economic backdrop  slows down quite a bit, within the next two years going into 2020?</p><p>BASTIAN:  Yes, we haven't seen it.  You read the headlines.  You would  anticipate that with tariffs and the rhetoric that is going on.  Our  international business is the strongest I've seen in years, so we're  continuing to serve that demand and we're optimistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations, Edward, great to see you.</p><p>BASTIAN:  Thanks, Maria.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Edward Bastian there, as the CEO at Delta  Air Lines.  Coming up, blast off, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, just landed a  major rocket deal.

Trebek even joked that she said yes too quickly before  he had the chance to say we'll have the answer right after the commercial  break.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And what happened to his beard?  Didn't he have a beard for a  while?  Trebek?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I missed that.  I missed that.  OK.  Yes, I think you're right.   Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, a Thursday night thriller.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Friday, September 28th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.  Time to vote.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to  vote this morning after the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his  accuser Christine Blasey Ford testified on Capitol Hill yesterday. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSER:  I have been accused of  acting out of partisan political motives.  I'm an independently person and  I am no one's pawn. </p><p> JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will not be intimidated into  withdrawing from this process.  You've tried hard.  You've given it your  all.  No one can question your efforts.  But your coordinated and well- funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive  me out. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will have more of the emotional testimony coming up this  morning.  As of now, we know that Senators Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham  have said that they will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh.  More trouble for  musk.  The Securities and Exchange Commission filing suit against the Tesla  CEO.  The commission looks to bar him from running a public company ever  again.  Tesla stock is getting plummeted in the premarket.  It is down 12- 1/2 percent right now. </p><p> Futures also showing a decline at the start of trading.  We're at the lows  of the morning.  Things have been worsening throughout the morning.  Dow  Industrials down 108 points right now almost one half of one percent.  S&amp;P  500 is down a third of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 36 point decline  down a half percent.  This after a pretty good day yesterday.  The major  indices higher across the board at the close yesterday.  NASDAQ best  performer up 51 points. </p><p> We're at the end of the third quarter.  This is the last trading day of the  third quarter.  The Dow is up almost nine percent for the quarter.  The  NASDAQ and the Standard &amp; Poor's are up seven percent in the prior three  months.  In Europe this morning, weakness across the board, FT 100 down  almost one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down one and a quarter percent and  the DAX Index in Germany at the low of the morning down 1-3/4 percent.   Asian markets also mixed overnight but mostly higher. </p><p> The Nikkei Average best performer in Japan up 1-1/3 percent.  Well, beware  the bear.  The Trump economy showing no signs of slowing down, solid  employment numbers and a booming market all signs that the U.S. economy is  doing well.  One economist though is warning that a recession is on the  horizon.  He's here.  Nouriel Roubini will join us.  Joining me to break it  all down right now is our own Dagen McDowell along with Kadena Group  President Gary B. Smith, and the Hill Columnist, Fox News Contributor, Liz  Peek. </p><p> Great to see you everybody this morning. </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  </p><p> GARY SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND PRESIDENT, KADENA GROUP:  Nice to be  here. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> Good to be here.  </p><p> PERRY:  -- the market is trying to figure out what to focus on, right?   There are so much going on, right? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is. </p><p> PEEK:  Yes. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SMITH:  -- right now marching to its own drummer to be honest with you.   All the news I think the markets held steady, you know, Maria knows I've  been bullish since the get-go.  I -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've right.  You've been right, Gary. </p><p> SMITH:  I probably still am, yes. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we got -- we got a market that has had a pretty good  quarter and a backdrop, Dagen, as we talk about every day.  That shows four  percent plus economic growth.  You have the GDP out yesterday 4.2 percent  and earnings for the quarter is going to be up 22 percent. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Maybe see -- we'll  see three percent growth, three percent plus growth this calendar year.   The first time that we will that will have happened and I keep saying it in  more than a decade because it did not happen in any year during the Obama  administration.  </p><p> PEEK:  And by the way we're the only major economy growing like that.  So I  mean it's sort of hard for investors to figure out where else to go. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One -- just one thing I want to call out yesterday.  There was a  lot to be appalled by coming from the Democrats.  But I think the height of  hypocrisy was Senator Richard Blumenthal lecturing Brett Kavanaugh about  credibility talking about the legal principle that jurors can rule a  witness to be completely untrue if they say one thing that is false.  This  is a man who lied about serving in Vietnam and then said yesterday that the  accuser Blasey Ford had witnesses who could corroborate her story. </p><p> That's a lie.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  Which we know isn't true.  They would have been -- they would  have been presented to us before by the media for sure. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How does he get away with that just saying fallacies? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I -- I'm ashamed that I ever lived in Connecticut that that  state would elect him to the Senate.  I am appalled by that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we should forget that Jim Comey also had a thing or two  to say about the same actually.  He tweeted about it.  And then Kim  Strassel from the Journal tweeted out about him because no mention of the  fact that she said she was afraid of flying and then, Mitchell, the sex  crimes prosecutor came up with a list, a litany of places from Hawaii to  Indonesia that she's been which was also pretty hypocritical. </p><p> PEEK:  This is all about stalling.  They just want to stall this process,  you know, that's why -- repeated requests for an FBI investigation,  etcetera, etcetera.  It's so politically driven.  It's really sad I think. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  It sure is.  We'll get to all of that including  the third quarter and get Gary's thoughts on what happens in fourth quarter  coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning Fox News Contributor and  former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove is  joining us this morning.  Roubini Macro Associates CEO, Nouriel Roubini has  a few things to say about that strength in the economy right now and what  happens in the future, and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY's\" own, Stuart Varney will  weigh in as well. </p><p> Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big hour coming up.  And we kick it  off right here with this top story.  Emotion, anguish, and reliving the  past, dramatic testimony yesterday on Capitol Hill as Judge Brett Kavanaugh  and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford made their case before the Senate Judiciary  Committee.  Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> FORD:  I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I would  like to.  But the details that about that night that bring me here today  are the ones I will never forget.  They have been seared into my memory and  it has haunted me episodically as an adult.  Indelible in the hippocampus  is the laughter.  The laugh -- the uproarious laughter between the two and  they're having fun at my expense.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe  Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you? </p><p> FORD:  One hundred percent.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One hundred percent?  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  Less than two weeks ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of  committing wrongdoing in an event more than 36 years ago when we were both  in high school.  I denied the allegation immediately, categorically, and  unequivocally.  This confirmation process has become a national disgrace.   The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation  process.  But you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. </p><p> This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political  hit fueled with apparent pent up anger about President Trump and the 2016  election.  Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record,  revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from  outside left-wing opposition groups.  This is a circus. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now for White House reaction is White House  Senior Adviser for the Strategic Communications, Mercedes Schlapp.   Mercedes, good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for being here.   Your reaction to what took place yesterday. </p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  Look,  it was a very long day and for Brett Kavanaugh, he spoke with great power  very compelling, and very consistent in his story.  He felt it was his  moment to talk about where -- the facts and he did that.  He brought out  the facts.  He brought out detail in terms of what -- of what his  activities where the summer of 1982.  But most importantly, Maria, he  talked about how disgraceful this process has been with the Democrats. </p><p> I mean let's be real.  OK.  The Democrats from day one said they were going  to do everything they could to stop Brett Kavanaugh.  That was their goal.   That was their focus.  They called him evil.  They called him a liar.   They've even gone out to the fact that agreeing with a certain allegation  that he could possibly be a gang raper.  I mean it is a process that's  become out of control.  And with that, the Democrats had also mishandled  this process. </p><p> They knew about this allegation for over 60 days, did nothing with it,  waited until the last minute, and then started to drag Judge Kavanaugh's  name through the mud.  It has been something like I've never seen before in  terms of trying to destroy someone who has served our country honorably,  someone who has spent his -- most of his life in public service, who has  worked for a former President, who has worked on the -- in the judicial  system very successfully and like how he has mentioned, Maria, he's an  independent judge. </p><p> He wants to do a good job.  He's well qualified for this job, yet this has  become a smear campaign, a character assassination of somehow who I know  personally and someone who I think should be on the Supreme Court. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean throughout the hearing yesterday the testimony  yesterday I think little by little people started to see through some of  the games that were going on, on the left, and I wonder if you have heard  from more people in the Senate in terms of the votes because we've already  heard from Bob Corker who says he will vote yes toward Brett Kavanaugh.  We  know that Lindsey Graham will.  I'm going to get to Lindsey Graham in a  moment.  But do you know of any -- do you think that the Senate has the  votes for confirmation certainly from the committee standpoint? </p><p> SCHLAPP:  You know, I feel we're in good shape.  I think that we'll see  what the Senate Judiciary Committee votes today what the vote is, but I  feel like we're in very good shape.  Obviously, Judge Kavanaugh was very  transparent, very forthcoming, presented the facts, presented evidence  against this allegation.  With that being said, obviously, what Dr. Ford  has experienced in her life is very saddening.  But it's very clear that  Judge Kavanaugh is innocent of this charges and he was willing to come  forth day one when these accusations came out, day one, and yet, you know,  here we are. </p><p> The GOP senator said we'll give her time.  We even -- they even offered to  go travel over to California.  She said she wasn't even aware of that  request, so you've got these Democrat political operative lawyers, Senator  Feinstein who referred her to these layers and you're saying that this is  not, you know, and there's people out there saying that this is not a  political game -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much -- how normal is it for a ranking member of the -- of  a major committee a judiciary committee to help a witness with her lawyer?   I mean Senator Feinstein's office helped Blasey Ford obtain her lawyer. </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes.  I just never seen anything like this and this is why  yesterday what it showed when the Democrats were trying to questioning  Kavanaugh, it was very clear that they were going to do what they can to  stop this man.  It is their biggest nightmare that he is decided that he's  not going to be intimidated that he's moving forward with this nomination,  that he's not going to stand down for the past 10 days what that family has  gone through is horrific.  It should not be like this in America. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, it shouldn't.  And you're right to say America because  that's what is at stake here.  I mean we basically through due process out  the window.  That's not America.  Senator Lindsey Graham said with a lot of  people were thinking.  He stood out on a Republican side giving this  impassioned speech about how he has enough of what he calls a charade.   Watch this. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  What you want to do is destroy  this guy's life, hold the seat open, and hope you win in 2020.  You said  that.  When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that Lindsey said hello  because I voted for them.  I would never do to them what you've done to  this guy.  This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Kim Strassel writes this morning in the Journal a vote no  if you vote no, you are legitimizing the most despicable thing I've seen in  my time in politics as Lindsey Graham said it.  A no vote now equals public  approval of every unhanded tactic deployed by the left in recent weeks, do  you think that outburst by Lindsey Graham helps Kavanaugh's confirmation or  does it hurt it? </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Look, I think Lindsey Graham was so incredibly powerful and at  that moment, it was critical for Lindsey Graham to send a message to these  Democrats.  These Democrats who have tried to smear Kavanaugh's name and he  stood up the same way Kavanaugh stood up for himself.  They got tired.   They're tired of being pushed by the left.  They're tired by the lies of  the left.  They're tired of false media -- liberal media reporting where  they would take any single possible accusation and try to pin it on  Kavanaugh. </p><p> And so it was an incredibly important moment during the hearing for all of  us because it represents that the Democrats are willing to go so low to  destroy an incredibly reputable man and I find that to be disgusting.  We  should, Maria, we should not be at that point right now when it comes to  confirming a Supreme Court justice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Liz Peek who's on the panel today pointed out the  New York Times headlined today, and you speak about media.  The New York  Times says high stakes dual of tears and furry unfold in Senate.  And  here's the line, Blasey prays for courage, Trump applauds Kavanaugh's  rebuttal. That's how the Times sums it up. </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Right.  And as Kavanaugh has said, this is about fairness.  This  is about both sides being heard.  This is, you know, again, we look at Dr.  Ford and maybe what she went through is incredibly difficult and we want to  listen as Kavanaugh said, sexual harassment of any kind is horrific.  But  with that being said, when you go to the basics take out the emotion, look  at the facts, look at the evidence. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p> SCHLAPP:  As it was presented in a public hearing yesterday under oath.  It  was very clear that Kavanaugh had the facts that is very clear that you had  those witnesses that basically had refuted her account.  So, again, we got  to look at the facts, put the emotions aside, and realize that Judge  Kavanaugh is innocent and has been saying he's innocent from day one.  He's  got the facts to prove it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mercedes, thanks for joining us this morning. </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank you so much. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Mercedes Schlapp is at the White House.   Coming up, trouble with Tesla.  CEO Elon Musk faces an SEC lawsuit over  his, \"Funding secured tweet.\"  He could lose his title as CEO and be barred  from running a public company again.  Then the Trump economy, we're firing  on all cylinders that does not seem to be signs of a slowdown, but Nouriel  Roubini is in the studio and he's warning of a recession on the horizon.   He's here later this hour. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A lot happening in markets this morning, Tesla  stock is down 12 percent after the Securities and Exchange Commission  charged Elon Musk with fraud.  Connell McShane is on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange.  Connell, good morning. </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Yes,  what a disaster for Tesla.  I don't know that the SEC involvement as this  came as a huge surprise to people.  But the timing of the lawsuit being  filed last night came a bit faster than some people thought it might come,  and securities fraud allegations against Elon Musk does have that stock  tumbling.  The allegation here is that he Musk did not have the funding  secured that he talked about to take the company private at $420 a share. </p><p> In fact, the SEC alleges that he never even discussed $420 with anybody  that was -- that might provide that funding never really had his act  together on it, and, you know, never discussed whether it was possible or  not.  But he did put a statement out last night.  Musk was saying he was  saddened and disappointed and talked about his integrity being his most  important value, and says the facts will show he never compromised in any  way. </p><p> Now, I will say this a couple of analyst comments that are of interest this  morning, Citigroup just downgraded the stock a little while ago here before  the open of trading.  And also J.P. Morgan analyst had an interesting  comment on Tesla shares, Maria, saying that this lawsuit could lead to a  world where Tesla is valued on its fundamentals alone which would not be a  good thing because as you know the stocks had been bid up over the years so  much on a bet on one person.  That person being Elon Musk. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Yes.  I mean earlier we were talking about, you  know, what happens to Apple with Steve Jobs gone.  But Connell, that's why  investors are reacting this morning and that's what you're seeing this  morning.  Gary B. Smith, your thoughts on this as the stock trades down, do  you worry that should Elon Musk be forced out then this stock continues to  plummet? </p><p> SMITH:  Well, not only the stock.  I see trouble on the horizon for the  company.  It's essentially been his vision like it has been with his  private companies, the boring company, the, you know, what he does with the  rockets and stuff like that, so I worry that the vision just like when  Steve Jobs temporarily left Apple, they kind of plummeted.  The whole  vision and, you know, reason for existence for Tesla goes away.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it came back and it's now a trillion-dollar company, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I guess, but guess what's going to what happen today?  If  Tesla shares decline more than 9.44 percent today or trade below $278.45,  the company's market value will fall behind that of General Motors -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's my point is again we priced this like it's a  technology company.  Gary, it's just an automobile manufacturer -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- very mercurial founder. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- electrical cars that haven't really resonated all that much  significantly. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  -- is cash flow problems.  That's the issue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big cash -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  Quick break and then the high stakes in historic  hearing on Capitol Hill.  We'll take a look at the fallout.  Then trade  turmoil, what the tariff clashes between China and the U.S. mean for the  global economy?  That is next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The high-stakes hearing on Capitol Hill and the  race to secure votes.  Senator Bob Corker announcing last night he say yes,  but there are a few key undecides.  The Washington Post reports former  President George W. Bush making calls this morning ahead of the final  confirmation vote next week in support.  Bush reportedly rallying support  from Republican Senator Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski,  along with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.  Key votes to Kavanaugh's  confirmation.  Joining us now is Fox News Contributor, former Deputy Chief  of Staff to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.  Karl, good to see you  this morning. </p><p> KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts. </p><p> ROVE:  Well, we had, you know, an historic moment yesterday if you take  each one of the presentations separately, they were both powerful, and  emotional, and credible.  But you can't take them separately.  You have to  take them together and then you have to examine them, and I thought the  Wall Street Journal editorial this morning got it absolutely right.   There's no corroboration of Dr. Ford's explanation.  The four people that  she mentioned at times it's been varying amounts. </p><p> But the four people that she has identified being there denied including  Leland Keyser who was her best friend or one of her best friends at the  time said she never even met Brett Kavanaugh.  We don't know how she got to  wherever she was.  We don't know how she got home.  All we know is that  that's some distance from where she started her day and she didn't speak of  it for 30 years until 2012 and even then didn't use Brett Kavanaugh's name,  so -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ROVE:  -- you know, we're in a country where the presumption of innocence  and you've got, you know, it's the burden is not on him to prove that he  wasn't there.  But I thought he did a pretty good job with his calendars of  disapproving a negative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Dagen, the op-ed that Karl refers to is from Kim  Strassel and she writes to vote against Judge Kavanaugh now is to overthrow  due process. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's that, you know, and also the editorial written by the  editorial board that they go into -- they go into the same issues of a  rejection will bring dishonor to the Senate.  It will validate the ambush  and smear politics that Democrats are using, but it will also turn Supreme  Court nominations over to the justice of the social media mob and the  politics of accusation.  It's time for the Senate to stand up and vote him  on to the Supreme Court. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> PEEK:  Karl, good morning.  It's Liz Peek.  It seemed like a public  sentiment really shifted dramatically from being pretty much in the court  of the accuser in the morning and then standing by Kavanaugh in the  afternoon.  At the end of the day, is it -- is it really going to come down  to public opinion?  Are Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, and Jeff Flake  really going to be swung by opinion polls or are we hoping that they are  actually going to see this for what Kim Strassel rightly points out is just  a complete dissent into anarchy here? </p><p> ROVE:  Yes.  I don't think any of the three people that you mentioned are  going to make decision by wetting their finger and blowing -- holding it in  air and see which way the wind blows, I don't.  The -- this is a -- this --  Kim is right.  The editorial board is right.  This is an important moment  for our political process.  If Judge Kavanaugh is not confirmed then this  will be a green light to use this in the future against any other Supreme  Court nominee that either side does not like. </p><p> But I will tell you, there's been -- I believe he will be confirmed.  Brett  Kavanaugh deserves to be confirmed and will be confirmed.  But the damage  to our system has been done.  And it's not going away easily.  They have  undermined confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court, this institution that for  so long in the modern era has stood aside from politics.  The Democrats by  organized systemic deliberate effort of character assassination have  undermined like it or not even if Brett is confirmed as I believe he will  be. </p><p> They have undermined the credibility of this great institution and it's not  going to be easily recovered. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just the way they undermined the credibility of the FBI and the  Department of Justice for not showing the world accountability after a  cabal of individuals put their finger on the scale or tried to stop Donald  Trump during the 2016 election.  Got to get that out because that's  important.  We need to trust our FBI and our DOJ.  Gary, go ahead. </p><p> SMITH:  Karl, Gary Smith.  Nice to see you again. </p><p> ROVE:  Gary B., good morning. </p><p> SMITH:  Good morning.  Quick question for you, if the nomination gets  derailed, what do you think the White House does as next steps? </p><p> ROVE:  Well, if it were to be derailed and I don't think it will be at this  point then they would quickly send out a replacement appointment and the  Republicans would move heaven and earth to get that nominee.  He or she  confirmed before the November election.  But the Democrats will use every  tool of obstruction they possibly can to stop it and there will be a period  during in which any new nominee is going to have to undergo the background  check that is routine. </p><p> And this is one of the things that gets me about Brett Kavanaugh who is a  personal friend of mine and a colleague from the White House for whom I  have enormous respect.  And his wife is one of the -- one of the finest  people that I know.  And he is undergone seven background checks including  two very deep background checks and when he was at the White House, and  then when he was put on the Court of Appeals, and none of this was ever  raised.  And I'm like Dagen. </p><p> I thought Dagen, you picked out one of my less favorite people on the  committee, Richard Blumenthal, that, you know, the stolen valor candidate  for the United States Senate who lectures Brett on credibility.  And so  many of the other members of the committee, you know, Senator Spartacus the  Thrace (ph), you know, was a hotdog in the hearings, and -- but all of  them, virtually, every one of them at the beginning of the -- even at the  beginning of the process before there was ever a hearing had announced  their intention to stop Brett's nomination, and they've used every tool  that they possibly can.  And shame on them for bringing -- for bringing  this on on the United States Senate.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, Karl, I would just expand it beyond just that  committee in terms of some of my least favorite people who've ever been  elected to office in the history of the republic.  I would expand it to  that, but --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Another conversation.</p><p> ROVE:  You've got a broad group you're going after this morning.  I like  it.  You must be drinking a lot of caffeine to keep at it.  I like it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, we are fired up here, Karl.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Now, it's Lindsey Graham got me fired up with that southern --  that southern flair and bluntness that we saw yesterday.  I paraphrase the  Great Chuck Yeager, we might be raw but we know right from wrong and we can  spot a phony before he ever says his first words.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> ROVE:  Yes, I thought Lindsey was terrific --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that he brought the heat yesterday.</p><p> ROVE:  I though Lindsey was terrific in that --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, he said what a lot of people were thinking, that's for  sure.</p><p> ROVE:  Yes, and I thought Kavanaugh did a great thing by calling out the  Democrats right at the beginning about -- between this process.  I love the  hypocrisy of calling for an FBI investigation after Dianne Feinstein kept  an FBI investigation from being conducted for 60 vital days when all of  this could have been resolved in private and Dr. Ford could have kept her  privacy and Brett Kavanaugh could have kept his reputation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, that was rich.  They support women and yet, they threw  her under the bus real quick.  Karl, good to see you, thanks very much for  joining us.  Karl Rove.</p><p> ROVE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, miracle in Micronesia, a plane goes crashing off of  a runway and into a lagoon.  Everybody was safe and they walked away.  We  will tell you about it.  And then, the Trump economy, Nouriel Roubini is  here to react.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, September 28th,  your top stories right now 8:35 a.m. on the east coast.  We've got the  latest data on personal income and spending.  Spending was off three-tenths  of a percent in line with estimates.  Personal income also up three-tenths  of a percent, but that it was lower than the expectations of four-tenths of  a percent.  </p><p> Futures are lower this morning, just shy of the low of the morning, down 90  points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 8-3/4 on the S&amp;P, and the  NASDAQ was weaker by 27-1/2, one-third of one percent lower.  We are  expecting a lower opening at the start of trading in less than an hour.  In  Europe this morning, markets are down across the board.  Worst performer is  in Germany.  DAX Index down 1-3/4 percent.  Overnight in Asia, markets were  mostly positive with the exception of Korea, as you can see.</p><p> Fireworks on Capitol Hill yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee set to  vote on Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh this morning.  This, after he  and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford told their stories yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> FORD:  I am here today not because I want to be, I am terrified.  I am here  because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while  Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.</p><p>KAVANAUGH:  I'm here today to tell the truth.  I've never sexually  assaulted anyone.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  As of now, we know that senators Bob Corker and Senator Lindsey  Graham have said that they will vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh.  The  committee vote is at 9:30 a.m. this morning.  Rescue at sea, more than 40  people saved after a plane skidded off the runway and crashed into a  pacific lagoon.  We will have the very latest.  And getting ready to binge,  Netflix releasing a new trailer for the final season of hit program \"House  of Cards.\"  We've got the highlights, coming up.</p><p> But first, this, markets are lower this morning, as you can see, on this,  the last trading day of the third quarter.  This, after personal income and  spending data just hit the wire and a GDP number yesterday that was in line  with expectations, and growth of 4.2 percent.  That was the final reading  of the second quarter.  Joining us right now is Roubini Macro Associates  CEO, NYU Stern School of Business professor, economist Nouriel Roubini.   Great to see you, Nouriel, thanks so much for being here.</p><p> NOURIEL ROUBINI, CEO, ROUBINI MACRO ASSOCIATES:  Great being here, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your characterization of the economy right now and what you're  expecting in the next year.</p><p> ROUBINI:  Well, the economy is doing well right now.  I expect it to grow  three percent this year, slightly less than three percent next year, but I  expect actually we're going to have a stall of growth and possibly a  recession by 2020, and that's due to many factors.  In my view, the economy  is growing three percent only because of a fiscal stimulus is one percent  of GDP.  This year and next year, by the end of next year, we have a  massive fiscal cliff that is more than one percent of GDP.  I don't think  that fiscal cliff is going to be (INAUDIBLE) easily.  Well, after the Fed  hiking from 225 all the way to 350.  The economy is obviously overheating.  </p><p> You have the trade wars, they're going to escalate.  This is not just a  trade war.  We'll have something of a cold war with China on trade, on  investment, on technology, on I.P., on everything, and it's not going to be  just with China, it's going to be with our allies and all the rest.  This  President was voted in on -- by American, (INAUDIBLE) American is  protectionist, and there's a whole bunch of other speculation (INAUDIBLE)  going to slow down growth and it will increase inflation, restricting  inward and outward FDI restriction to migration.  We don't have any  infrastructure plan and so on and so on.  In the end, it's going to slow  down and it's slowing down.  China is going to slow down --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Were you expecting the economy to fall apart when Donald Trump  was first elected?</p><p> ROUBINI:  No, I was not expecting to fall apart, no.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But were you expecting things to lessen?  I mean, his economic  policies when you look at the tax cuts and the rolling back of regulation  has helped the economy.  I'm just trying to understand better why you see  this fiscal cliff happening next year?</p><p> ROUBINI:  Well, first of all, you know, the CBO that is independent  (INAUDIBLE) led by Republicans said the impact of a tax cut on potential  growth is going to be close to zero, 0.1 percent over 10 years, and it's  temporary.  You have a stimulus for the first two years, and the way it was  designed was to maximize the stimulus by the time of the midterm elections,  and then you're going to have a severe fiscal cliff because the way they  were designed was to be revenue neutral by the end of the decade, and  therefore, for two years, you have a massive stimulus.  If you look at the  data, one percent of GDP.  Then, you drag in 2020, and the drag becomes  actually severe drag by 2025.  That's the way it was designed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's on the other side of that train.</p><p> SMITH:  (INAUDIBLE) I want to clarify a couple of things.</p><p> ROUBINI:  Yes, the numbers.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SMITH:  Your rhetoric almost says depression, but you said recession.</p><p> ROUBINI:  Yes.</p><p> SMITH:  Isn't by definition most recessions pretty short and not that  severe?</p><p> ROUBINI:  Well, you know, this time around, I think the risk is that, if  and when we're going to have that recession, it might be as severe as the  previous one or could be worse, and it could be worse for two reasons: one  is that today, in the U.S. and globally, debt ratios are higher than they  were before the global financial crisis.  Debt ratio have gone globally,  private and public from 160 to 260 percent their GDP globally.  So, it's a  much more, bigger debt problem.  Debt servicing ratios are low because  interest rates are being low, but now the Fed is normalizing, other central  bank are normalized, so we've higher normal real rates and high debt  ratios.  We're going to see like corporate debt --</p><p> SMITH:  So, you're saying this recession could be worse than the previous  recession.</p><p> ROUBINI:  Could be.  And second factor is important (INAUDIBLE) to make a  point is that we're constraint in terms of policy tools.  We ran out of  policy bullets.  The headroom on policy rates is not going to be 600 basis  points, it's going to be at most 300.  Fiscal policy (INAUDIBLE) $2  trillion of debt and deficit even before the next recession, and the  political willingness to backstop and bailout banks, corporates, house --  it's going to be constraint, and some government (INAUDIBLE) so policy  (INAUDIBLE) being more constraints, debt ratios are higher, and financial  (INAUDIBLE) these are higher.</p><p> SMITH:  I agree, I think you've done fantastic research and your facts are  right, but didn't you say a lot of that stuff right before the bottom of  the market in 2009, that you said the worst was yet to come and we've had  one of the greatest rallies in the stock market in the last eight years,  and in the economy, and that's despite the restrictive policies that Obama  have.</p><p> ROUBINI:  I never predicted until now that there'll be another global  recession even when there was a risk of hard landing in China 2015, and '16  have said China (INAUDIBLE) policy tools when there were worries about the  (INAUDIBLE) in 2015, I said Greece is not going to exit the Eurozone.   Eurozone is not going to collapse.  So, this time around, when I look  ahead, I see 10 factors.  It's fiscal policy, it's monetary policy, it's  trade wars, it's other stagflationary policies by the U.S. administration,  slowdown in (INAUDIBLE), slowdown in China, slowdown in Europe, which  what's happening (INAUDIBLE) this morning with the Italy with (INAUDIBLE)  between the banks and otherwise, and we have (INAUDIBLE) asset prices,  nothing is cheap.  Public equities are not cheap, private equities are not  cheap, the real estate is not cheap, (INAUDIBLE) not cheap, (INAUDIBLE)  bonds are not cheap (INAUDIBLE) ratio is 50 percent above historical norms,  so we know they'll be a correction, and we know that there's illiquidity in  the market.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ROUBINI:  We also know that policy tools are constraint and we have more  debt.  So, I'm just saying --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The World Trade Organization -- the World Trade Organization is  cutting its outlook for global trade due to the increasing trade tensions  around the world, but this is because largely this tit-for-tat in trade.   But we had a guest on the other day, Dagen, who basically said the risk is  to the upside, as a result of these trade talks, right?  He was saying that  if President Trump gets a win with Europe, with Canada, with Japan, these  markets will rip.</p><p> ROUBINI:  Oh, there is that certainly possibility.  That is just a  negotiating ploy, art of the deal, but if I read what the U.S. is saying --  the U.S. -- if you read the new national security strategy of the U.S.,  they say China is strategic rival of the U.S., and if we let China, we  endanger the future, it's threat not just to our economic issue (INAUDIBLE)  also to our national security.  It's the containment of China strategy is  trade, is investment, is FDI, is technology, is joint ventures, it's across  the board.  This is a new cold war that this economic financial, political,  and geopolitical.  I think markets are underestimating that we are on a  collision course with China, and not just with China, I think this is an  administration that --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we definitely -- we're having a (INAUDIBLE) with China.</p><p> ROUBINI:  -- buy American, hire American.  America first, make America  great again.  This is a protectionist administration.  (INAUDIBLE) is gone,  you have Peter Navarro, you have Lighthizer, you have the President, you  have the Wilbur Ross (INAUDIBLE) protection.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know how that leads -- but I don't know how that leads  to a recession.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p> ROUBINI:  But I spoke about -- and other factors.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you have.</p><p> ROUBINI:  In addition to it, there is also stagflationary (INAUDIBLE)  coming from trade, investment, migration that reduce growth and increase  inflation, and the Feds will have to hike more given the (INAUDIBLE)  shocks.</p><p> PEEK:  OK.  So, China actually has already slowed somewhat, but the United  States' GDP is 40 percent bigger than China.  It seems to me we are now  seeing for the first time, massive increases in sentiment which have led to  booming consumer spending and investment by corporations which we haven't  seen really in 10 years.  Seems to me that's a very forceful propellant for  the next couple of years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because of the rollback in regs.</p><p> ROUBINI:  It is -- it is (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what she said.</p><p> ROUBINI:  -- housing sector.  As we know, the tax plan makes the tax cuts  on the corporate permanent while after 2020, the tax rates on the household  gradually go higher and higher than they were before because they have to  pay for this 1.5 inflation to make sure that after the 10 year decade,  there's not going to be another deficit.  So, the way they did this is by  making permanent the tax for the corporate and making temporary the tax on  the housing sector.

If the  recession happens in 2020, what happens to the stock market?  Very quickly.</p><p> ROUBINI:  I think that already by late part of 2019, asset price are  forward looking and they're going to sharply correct downwards, and it will  lead to recession.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much?</p><p> ROUBINI:  You know, in a typical risk (INAUDIBLE) last 10 years where it's  seven of them, markets were down 10 percent, they went up -- if you have an  (INAUDIBLE) it's a bear market, 20 percent or more, and if the recession  does --</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  From President Trump on the world stage to  fireworks on Capitol Hill, it has been quite the week.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I've loved every minute of it,  frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.  I know.</p><p> VARNEY:  It's going to cap off today.  Let me take you back, Tuesday,  President Trump addresses the United Nations, an American President stands  up, America first.  Wednesday, an astonishing Presidential news conference,  never seen anything like it, rapid fire, direct answers to all questions,  it's clearly not the Obama-era, and then yesterday, the nation's glued to  the Kavanaugh hearings, standout moments, Dr. Ford says she's 100 percent  sure that it was Kavanaugh that did that event, 35 years ago.  The judge  himself defended himself and attacked the Democrats, then up came Lindsey  Graham with a blistering attack on the Democrats.  And today, rounding out  the week, the vote.  And it will probably take place during the three hours  of our show from 9:00 to noon.  I urge people to stay glued to the vote  today, on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  That's it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, we will be there, Stu!  We will see you in a few minutes,  thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his guests.   First though, coming up, rescue at sea, the harrowing pictures of a plane  crash-landing where everybody was able to walk away, next.  And then,  Carrie Underwood is back.  A sneak peak of the new \"House of Cards\"  trailer, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A powerful earthquake rocked Indonesia.  Lauren  Simonetti on headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, Maria.  A magnitude 7.5  quake destroyed many homes there.  It was centered off the island of  Sulawesi.  Authorities briefly issued a tsunami warning but that was later  lifted.  At least one death has been reported, but officials say this death  toll could rise.</p><p> And check this out, a passenger jet crashes into the water in Micronesia,  and a dozen of passengers, you can see them there, were rescued.  Officials  say the Boeing 737 crashed in a lagoon.  As it was landing, remarkably,  everybody was OK.  One survivor describing the scary landing.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE, PLANE CRASH SURVIVOR:  I thought we landed on -- until I  looked over and saw a hole in the side of the plane and water was coming  in.  I was really impressed with the locals, who immediately started coming  out in boats.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  He seemed so calm.  Investigators are trying to determine what  caused that crash.  Boeing landing a $9-billion contract with the Air  Force.  The company will build hundreds of new training jets to replace the  Air Force's current fleet which is more than 57 years old.  Meanwhile, Jeff  Bezos' Blue Origin has been tapped to supply engines for a joint venture  between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  This venture sends U.S. military and  spy satellites into outer space.  Take a look at shares of Boeing, up 24  percent.  Lockheed Martin shares down seven percent on the year.</p><p> And the trailer for the final season of Netflix's \"House of Cards\" is out,  and Claire Underwood has the power.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CLAIRE UNDERWOOD:  The reign of the middle-aged white man is over.  See  whatever Francis told you the last five years, don't believe a word of it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I watched the whole thing and I had the chills.  Robin Wright's  character describes the tumultuous first 100 days as President, including  an assassination attempt against her, and the death of her onscreen husband  Frank Underwood, formerly played by Kevin Spacey.  And Spacey will be  completely absent from the season after allegations of sexual assault  against him.  Season six out November 2nd.  Netflix shares down half a  percent this morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  Coming up, final  thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Liz  peek?</p><p> PEEK:  Well, the market is down going into the weekend, but I think that  may just be a reflection of quarters and there's really no bad economic  news, still very, very strong.  I disagree with our guest, Nouriel Roudini.   I think the economy is in very good shape right now.  But I do think this  Elon Musk thing is the story of the day, really interesting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Aside from the Kavanaugh hearing.</p><p> PEEK:  Well, yes, of course.  Excusez-moi.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SMITH:  Getting to that point, I think that's the most important day  politically since the Trump election.  I mean, I think things really bend  one way or another depending on what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because of this vote at 9:30.</p><p> SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, the overall senate vote on Tuesday.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I cede my time to you, because I want to hear what you think  about the market.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SMITH:  And then I talked about politics?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm like, come on, man.  Give me something here.  Are you  worried about Tesla in the --</p><p> SMITH:  I am worried about -- I'm worried about the SEC completely removing  the CEO from a public company and not allowing him to serve.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, and hurting shareholders who believe in Elon Musk.</p><p> SMITH:  Exactly.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  $50 billion market cap would fall below G.M. today.</p><p> PEEK:  But that's kind of a problem that he has been imbued with this sort  of cult-like following.  And if you look at the comments when someone says  maybe they have a cash flow problem, they are attacked.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's amazing.  They sure are.  Anyway, have a great  weekend, everybody.  I'll see you on \"WALL STREET\" as well as \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  Here's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and Stuart.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning -- everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Friday.  It is Friday, September 28th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Fireworks on Capitol Hill -- the Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote  this morning on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  This, after he and  his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, told their stories yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let's go back to  the incident.  What is the strongest memory you have?  </p><p> CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, KAVANAUGH ACCUSER:  In the hippocampus is the  laughter -- the uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun  at my expense.  </p><p> JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  My family and my name have  been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional  accusations.  The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, to the  Supreme Court.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More on the fiery testimony in just one minute.  And we should  tell you that ahead of this vote today, Senator Bob Corker has said he will  vote yes for Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p> A suit for Musk; the Securities and Exchange Commission charging the Tesla  CEO with misleading investors.  Tesla is taking a hit in the premarket,  stock is down 12.25 percent.  Musk's response to the suit coming up.</p><p> Markets are lower this morning, take a look.  Dow Industrials now at the  low of the morning with a decline of about 60 points, that's a quarter of a  percent.  S&amp;P 500 also down a quarter of a percent, as is the Nasdaq with  an 18.5 point decline.</p><p> This after all the major indices tacked on gains yesterday, up 54 points on  the Dow and the S&amp;P was up eight points, and the Nasdaq at the close, up  two-thirds of a percent, 51 points higher.</p><p> As we end the near of the second quarter, this is the last trading day of  the third quarter.  The Dow picked up almost 9 percent.  The Nasdaq and the  S&amp;P up 7 percent for the third quarter.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the trading performance. FT 100 down  39 points half of a percent.  CAC 40 is down three-quarters of a percent  and the DAX index down 1.25 percent.</p><p> Asian markets this morning finishing mostly in positive territory, best  performer Japan.  Nikkei average up one and a third percent.</p><p>Google is in the hot seat today.  The company's CEO is headed to Capitol  Hill today for a close door meeting with lawmakers.  This, amid charges  that the search engine does not treat conservative voices fairly.</p><p> And barrels of trouble - why whiskey makers are saying that the trade  tensions could put us in a bourbon burden. </p><p> All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining us to break  it all down Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, along with Kadina Group president  Gary B. Smith, and \"The Hill\" columnist, Fox News contributor Liz Peek.   Great to see everybody this morning.  </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.</p><p> GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP:  Nice to be here.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What a day yesterday.  We all watched.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the question going forward, we were talking about it in the  break, what are the consequences of Republicans voting no on Brett  Kavanaugh potentially.</p><p> To quote Kimberley Strassel's column in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"The  Kavanaugh Stakes\".  And I'll say this -- if a Republican votes against  Brett Kavanaugh you are standing with the sleeze on the left.  You're  standing by ambush tactics.  You're standing by the smears.  And it has  consequences not just for the man and his family but for the Supreme Court,  the Senate, and the country at large.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  I think this op-ed is so powerful  this morning from Kim Strassel.  And you're right.  She goes through it and  she basically says \"Any vote no, the stakes go even further to the core of  the country's principles.  To vote against Kavanaugh is to overthrow due  process.\"  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Overthrowing due process and essentially sending the message to  the country that an individual believes all men are liars and all women are  victims.  Nobody buys that.  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  Abandoning the presumption of innocence, which is sort of the  bedrock of our judiciary system and everything else.  I mean I think it's  an appalling approval of character assassination as sort of the first line  of defense.</p><p> This is all about the complexion of the court changing should Kavanaugh end  up on the Supreme Court.  It is not about what he did when he was a  teenager.  It's about basically losing an election in 2016 which allows  President Trump to appoint a conservative justice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly what Lindsey Graham said yesterday.  The Senator  said exactly what so many people were thinking.</p><p> Joining the conversation this morning, White House senior advisor for  strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp is here.  Revolution chairman  and CEO and former AOL CEO Steve Case is here.  Economist Nouriel Roubini  will join us.  And former White House press secretary under President  Trump, Sean Spicer is here as well.</p><p> We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p> And we kick it off right here -- an emotionally-charged day on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett  Kavanaugh publicly testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee over  sexual harassment allegations.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FORD:  Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life for a very long  time.  I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone these details.  It is  not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on  the Supreme Court.  My responsibility is to tell you the truth.  </p><p> LEAHY:  Then let's go back to the incident.  What is the strongest memory  you have?  </p><p> FORD:  Indelible in hippocampus is the laughter -- the uproarious laughter  between the two and they're having fun at my expense.  </p><p> SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  With what degree  of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  </p><p> FORD:  100 percent.  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  I'm here today to tell the truth.  I've never sexually  assaulted anyone.  I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family.</p><p> The other night, Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little  Liza, all 10 years old said to Ashley we should pray for the woman -- a lot  of wisdom from a 10-year-old.  </p><p> SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Are Dr. Ford's  allegations true?  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  They're not accurate as to me.  I have not questioned that she  might have been sexually assaulted at some point in her life by someone,  some place, but as to me, I've never done this.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  Do you swear to God?  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  I swear to God.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This coming as Republican Senator Bob Corker says he will be  voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  We are waiting on  the others and that vote.  The committee vote is today at 9:30.</p><p> Joining us right now two New York representatives -- Republican  Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.   Congresswomen -- great to see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Thank you.  </p><p> REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Maloney -- I want to begin with you.  You waited  for Judge Kavanaugh's arrival yesterday with actress Alyssa Milano.  Why  were you with Alyssa Milano?  </p><p> MALONEY:  I went over to see the hearing.  She happened to be there.  At  first, Senator Feinstein said I had a ticket.  And then they moved to a  much smaller room.  She said I did not have a ticket.  There would be four  seats for members of Congress and I came very early to make sure that I had  one of those seats.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She was recording the hearing.  Is that against rules?  </p><p> MALONEY:  I really don't know.  I did not know she was recording it.  But I  assume everywhere I go I'm being recorded now on these phones.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  She was -- </p><p> MALONEY:  And obviously she didn't have to record it.  You recorded it.   Everyone recorded it.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  You're not supposed to record it from inside the  courtroom, you know that, right?  You're a congresswoman.  She was asked to  stop and she did in fact comply.  </p><p> MALONEY:  Well, you should ask her about it.  I don't know anything about  it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the hearing yesterday?  </p><p> MALONEY:  Well, I thought it was riveting.  And I thought Dr. Ford gave a  very sincere, honest, authentic testimony that was tremendously moving.   And Brett Kavanaugh also gave a very emotional testimony that was  incredibly partisan and attacking against Democrats.</p><p> Usually in these confirmation hearings they talk about the law, they talk  about working together for the future of the country.  It was a partisan  attack on -- the most partisan testimony I've ever heard.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A partisan testimony on the Democrats' part?  </p><p> MALONEY:  On Judge Kavanaugh's part.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Tenney, your thoughts?  </p><p> TENNEY:  Look, I thought they were both very believable.  I thought that  she seemed to be sincere.  But I think this is really important.  It comes  down to credibility.  And I don't think taken as a whole the evidence  surrounding what brought her to the hearing in the first place was  credible. </p><p> I think that she -- if Senator Feinstein really cared about this woman and  sexual assault is a very, very serious issue.  As a lawyer I have  encountered this many times with many of my clients.  She would have  brought this immediately to law enforcement or the FBI to do an  investigation.  Instead, they held it.</p><p> So all of that moving testimony was really not credible and I respectfully  disagree with my colleague who is a terrific member of my committee, this  is -- Brett Kavanaugh is under attack.  His family is under attack.  He was  defending himself against some of the worst kind of accusations against a  person, dragging him through his high school days, a young man obviously  very well accomplished.  He's somebody who had a lot of fun but someone who  also, you know, was very, very smart, did really well, participated in all  kinds of sports and activities.</p><p> So I just thought it was a character assassination.  I felt that Mr.  Kavanaugh or Judge Kavanaugh was right to defend himself and his family.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I know that your father was a New York Supreme Court  justice.  You were a lawyer who has previously represented sexual assault  victims so we wanted to get your take on that.</p><p> But I guess what strikes me is, Congresswoman Maloney, is the idea that you  say it was this partisan attack and yet Ford remains unable to marshal as  Kim Strassel writes, to marshal any evidence for her claim of sexual  assault.  There was no corroboration whatsoever of her claims of sexual  assault.  Did you not -- does that not strike you?  </p><p> MALONEY:  Well, first of all -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was there due process in this whole proceeding in your view?  </p><p> MALONEY:  Well, to answer your question, she originally wanted to be  anonymous.  That's why Senator Feinstein did not call for the FBI  investigation in the beginning.  But the minute that her identity became  public, both Senator Feinstein and Dr. Ford have called for and support an  FBI investigation. </p><p> There were a number of people there, according to her testimony, interview  them.  Let's have the FBI get together one set of facts, so that one set of  facts are before the committee.  And that is I think should be a  fundamental -- we shouldn't move forward without an FBI investigation on  her points and others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MALONEY:  And I'd like to respond to what my friend and colleague has said  about the assault on Brett Kavanaugh.  Well, let's look at what she's  gained from this.  She's got death threats.  She's literally had to move  her family twice because of death threats.  She really hasn't gotten  anything out of this except for her belief in wanting integrity in the  process for the appointment to the Supreme Court -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MALONEY:  -- a lifetime appointment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She obviously truly believes that he was the one that did this  to her and obviously whatever she went through is just horrible.</p><p> But you mentioned Dianne Feinstein.  You know, she said she denied  releasing the information from the letter and yet the \"Washington Post\" got  the letter.  I mean hers is the only office who had the letter.  So it's  rich to say, you know, I can't believe that, you know, she wanted to be  anonymous and then all of a sudden she's not anonymous.  When in fact, yes,  she wanted to be anonymous but Feinstein's office sat on the letter for six  weeks and then the \"Washington Post\" suddenly got it.  </p><p> MALONEY:  But she was anonymous in her tip to the \"Washington Post\".  It  was the -- it came out -- somehow the press found out and were -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Somehow but the only person who had the letter  Feinstein's office so how somehow -- the press got it.  </p><p> MALONEY:  Well, I don't know how the press got it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was leaked.  </p><p> MALONEY:  But I believe that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was leaked, probably by Feinstein's office. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MALONEY:  -- Feinstein was listening to -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying.</p><p> Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono's campaign is apologizing this morning.   She sent a fund raising e-mail during the Ford testimony, according to  published news reports.  The message reportedly said the money would be  donated to organizations helping survivors of sexual assault.  Your  thoughts on that -- Congresswoman?  </p><p> MALONEY:  She has apologized.  And I accept her apology.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This whole idea of throwing due process out the window before  anybody's allegations are corroborated -- Congresswoman Tenney, I wonder  what your thoughts are in terms of what -- how this is resonating with the  people.  </p><p> TENNEY:  Well, I certainly -- it's probably district by district.  But I  know I'm getting an overwhelming amount of concern on both sides about the  process.  And I don't disagree with my colleague, Representative Maloney.   I think it was a terrible thing for both of these people to go through.</p><p> And unfortunately, Dianne Feinstein is the person, obviously you could see  by the awkward moment in the testimony yesterday that, they probably did  leak the memo and that maybe will come out at some point.</p><p> And so unfortunately, both of them were dragged through this process.  And  I think it was interesting, and you played the clip where Judge Kavanaugh  recognized his own daughter feeling sympathy for Dr. Ford.  And I did too  when I was watching her.</p><p> I said as a woman and watching what she had been through -- but again, I go  back to the big point is this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TENNEY:  Was she believable?  Yes.  Was it credible the way this was all  put together? Do I believe she was probably a victim?  Probably.  Do I  believe it's Brett Kavanaugh?  I don't think so.  </p><p> And I hate to admit that I also kept calendars when I was in high school  and college because I was a very busy student as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> TENNEY:  So this guy is an accomplished man.  He should be confirmed.  I  think this was a charade.  I think Lindsey Graham really highlighted it.  I  though he was the superstar last night.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There were a lot of funny tactics.  I think you would  both agree.</p><p> Carolyn Maloney -- </p><p> MALONEY:  Thank you.</p><p> TENNEY:  Well, I think we should have an FBI investigation and get to the  facts and then move forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman -- thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much for joining us.  Both Claudia Tenney,  Carolyn Maloney -- great to see you both, ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Heartbreak in North Carolina, a body believed to be the missing six-year- old autistic boy has been found.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti with the details -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Tragic story --  Maria.</p><p> Search crews discovered the body of a child believed to be that missing  autistic boy, Maddox Ritch.  His body was found partially submerged in a  creek about a mile from where Maddox was reported missing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROBERT HELTON, GASTONIA POLICE CHIEF:  I'm heartbroken.  This is not the  end that we had hoped for.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  His father says the six-year-old ran off last Saturday while  they were walking together in a park.  Investigators are working to find  out how the boy died, if there was any foul play involved.  That  investigation is ongoing.</p><p> Well, Audi's CEO reportedly on the verge of losing his job.  Volkswagen is  Audi's parent company and they're expected to fire Rupert Sadler as early  as today.  Sadler has been in jail since June over his alleged connections  to the diesel emissions cheating scandal that began three years ago.</p><p> Shares of Volkswagen -- not a good year them -- they're down about 13  percent.</p><p> And you don't have to worry about running out of Kentucky bourbon.  An  industry trade group says distilleries last year pumped out 7.5 million  barrels of aging whiskey.  That is the most since 1972.  But the good times  might be over.  An industry leader is warning that trade disputes in key  overseas markets could mean global customers start drinking less.  I guess  then prices go down, right.  We'll have more in the market.  </p><p> Cheers to them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p> Coming up -- renewed trouble for Tesla.  The stock is down big today.  The  latest controversy for CEO Elon Musk as the Securities and Exchange  Commission files a lawsuit for fraud.  That's coming up.</p><p> Then, medical training goes high tech.  We're checking out the new robot  that can bleed, scream and cry -- later this hour.</p><p> Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> More turmoil for Tesla -- this is big.  The Securities and Exchange  Commission is suing Elon Musk for fraud over his tweet about taking the  company private at $420, funding secured.  The case raising questions about  executives using social media to get news out.</p><p> Joining me right now is Steve Case.  He is the chairman and CEO of  Revolution.  And he's the former CEO of AOL.  Steve -- it's great to see  you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> STEVE CASE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, REVOLUTION:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a lot happening on Capitol Hill with some of your  colleagues in the business, speaking to lawmakers.</p><p> But first, let me get your reaction to what's happening with Elon Musk and  Tesla with this SEC lawsuit.</p><p> CASE:  Well Elon is obviously one of the great entrepreneurs of our  generation.  I have great respect for what he's been building with Tesla  and SpaceX and so many other things.  But I think -- and I obviously  support that CEOs should use social media and the Internet to reach out to  customers and other constituencies and, you know, kind of tell their  stories.  </p><p> But I do think there's a number of examples now where maybe Elon, by his  own admission, probably should get a little more sleep and probably should  be a little more careful before he tweets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. I mean a lot of discussion this morning about what happens  to Tesla if Elon Musk is not there.  I mean he's, you know, being sued by  the SEC.  They're saying we are looking for him to not be able to serve as  the CEO of a public company.  Your thoughts on Tesla -- can it survive  without Elon Musk?  </p><p> CASE:  Well, I'm sure it could.  People said could Apple survive without  Steve jobs.  But clearly, Elon has been a key part of Tesla so hopefully  this is a bump in the road and over time they'll resolve this issue and  Elon will be able to kind of focus on taking Tesla and some of his other  companies to the next level.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Steve -- let me switch gears and ask you about  Google on Capitol Hill today.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to meet with  top GOP lawmakers today.  You know, that this comes amid growing scrutiny  against the company and many social media sites for alleged biased search  results, violations of policy, renewed relationship with China as it  relates to Google specifically.</p><p> I spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday.  He'll be  meeting with Pichai today.  Here's what he tells me.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I mean he's committed  to coming to a hearing this year, which is a change of where Google has  been.  I'm concerned because 90 percent of all searches go through Google.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ninety percent.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And 95 percent of everybody drops off by that second page.   So that first page matters a lot.  Their real concerns are the conservative  voices being able to come across.  And I think transparency is key.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that -- Steve?  Google is doing 90 percent of all  search.  </p><p> CASE: Obviously it's been a huge success.  We were early supporters when I  was running AOL.  We did a deal with Google at one point, I own about 5  percent of Google.  When it was a little company, it was just, you know,  Larry and Sergey and a few other people.</p><p> Now it's 100,000 employees and has a huge impact obviously globally, both  in terms of how people get information and also being a significant part of  the advertising market.  It's not surprising therefore that there's more  scrutiny, more attention. </p><p> I'm glad Google is going to be in Washington today to talk about what  they're doing.  And think about what the role of these big platforms is.   And as I say, it's not surprising that there's more of a backlash against  big tech or backlash against Silicon Valley.  I predicted it almost three  years ago.</p><p> I wrote the book, \"The Third Wave\" because as these platforms become bigger  and have more impact and in some cases -- in the face of Facebook maybe  even influence the election -- it's not surprising there's nor scrutiny.  I  think there will be more entrepreneurs in this third wave of the Internet  when you're dealing with health care and food and other smart cities.</p><p> Policies are going to matter more.  Regulations are going to matter more.   It's not just about the disruptive entrepreneurs going, you know, focusing  on technology in Silicon Valley.  It's also engaging in a respectful and  responsive way with the policy makers in Washington, Brussels and other  places.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's absolutely.  And therein lies the problem, right.   Because when you were talking about when you were an investor in Google, a  small company -- today as you say 100,000 employees, 90 percent of all  search results.  Do you feel a new tone in terms of the regulatory  environment that we could see perhaps calls for this company to be broken  up?  Or is this sort of the regular way the pendulum swings and you  remember what happened with Microsoft, when Microsoft was a real target  because of its size and its influence.  These companies are more powerful  today than ever before.  </p><p> CASE:  They are very powerful.  I was part of the whole Microsoft issue  when I was running AOL and some of the anti-trust issues.  I was even  deposed on that trial when the government was basically challenging  Microsoft.</p><p> At the time, they had something like 95 percent market share in operating  systems with Windows and there was a concern by the government which I  shared that they were doing some things that were not necessarily, you  know, supportive of entrepreneurs and others in the ecosystem in terms of  what they wanted to do to innovate.</p><p> Ultimately, you know, Microsoft decided to pull back.  It was a little bit  more careful, kind of self-regulated.  And I think I think that is the best  approach for these big companies, not just you know, Google but other  companies, Facebook and Amazon and so forth.</p><p> But if they don't do that, there's no question that there will be more  scrutiny.  I think there should be more scrutiny because these companies  are playing not just a significant role in our lives, and having a  significant influence on our economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p> And now let's look at the AT&amp;TTime Warner merger.  Nine state attorneys  general are backing AT&amp;T as the Justice Department seeks to reverse the  approval of the company's $85.5 billion acquisition of Time Warner.  Your  take on this deal and its impact.  </p><p> CASE:  Well, obviously I have some history with Time Warner since we merged  AOL and Time Warner almost 20 years ago -- 19 years ago.  A lot has changed  since obviously.</p><p> I think the strategic logic of the deal, if they can figure out a way to  run it in a more integrated kind of way kind of makes sense.  I was a  little surprised when the merger closed and then, you know, the government  kind of filed this appeal.  I think it's better if these things are  resolved before things close as opposed to after things close.  But we'll  see how this stuff plays out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think they should allow this to go through?  </p><p> CASE:  I think they probably should have decided earlier if they really  were going to have concerns about it.  I think once -- again, I don't know  all the details.  I've been focusing on working with entrepreneurs in the  middle of the country, not on thinking about what Time Warner and AT&amp;T  should be doing in Washington, D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you about that --- Steve.</p><p> CASE:  But it seems like it should have been resolved earlier.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because you're leading the Rise of the Rest Summit.  This is a  nationwide an effort to invest in entrepreneurship; help build businesses  across the country.  This is really an important part of the employment  story in our country.  Entrepreneurs and small business create the jobs.   Tell us more about your effort.  </p><p> CASE:  It's very exciting.  We launched this Rise of the Rest initiative  over four years ago.  But today we're in Chicago.  Yesterday we had a  hundred entrepreneurs from 50 different cities that are doing amazing  things in sectors all across the economy.  We brought them together to  share perspective.  A half a dozen of our investors that are partners,  L.P.'s in the Rise of the Rest Fund, including Eric Schmidt, and you know,  the venture capitalist Jim Breyer of Silicon Valley, Dan Gilbert from  Detroit, Ted Leonsis from D.C., Brad Keywell from here and Chicago.   They're all sharing perspectives on scaling companies.  </p><p> We really believe the next wave of entrepreneurship is not going to just  happen on the coast, it's going to happen all across the country.  And you  said, that's critical.  Because the big job creators in our -- in our  country are the young, high growth startups.  And if we're only backing the  startups on the coast -- last year, 75 percent of venture capital went to  three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> CASE:  While the other 47 states fight over 25 percent.  So, big states  like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, get less than one percent.  </p><p> So, we need to back the entrepreneurs there, creating the jobs there to  offset the disruption of technology that's happening on the coast which  will continue to happen with A.I., robotics, driverless trucks.  They're  going to destroy jobs in the middle of the country if we don't offset that  at least in part by backing on entrepreneurs in the middle of the country  to create jobs in the middle of the country.  </p><p> That somewhat, some of the challenges we have right now including on the --  on the political front are going to worsen.  There are a lot of people in  this country -- the majority of the country by some estimates are anxious  and fearful of the future.  They don't view innovation as a good thing or  disruption as a good thing.  They view it as a bad thing.  It's going to  end up potentially destroying their jobs or their communities.  </p><p> So, we need to make sure we understand that startups play a critical role.   We need to level the playing field so everybody, everywhere really has a  shot at the American dream.  And we're creating jobs all across the  country, not just on the coast.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, you just say three states get the majority  of what, private equity?  </p><p> CASE:  75 percent -- venture capitalist.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Venture capital.</p><p> CASE:  If you look at the venture capital dollars, according to the NBC at  a Venture Capital Association last year 75 percent went to just three  states.  Actually, (INAUDIBLE) they cover --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.</p><p> CASE:  90 percent of the venture capital went to men, less than 10 percent  to women.  </p><p> So, we have some work to do to make sure we're backing every entrepreneur  everywhere.  That's what Rise the rest is all about, and these hundred  entrepreneurs.  It's really gratifying and exciting to hear their stories  yesterday --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p> CASE:  -- when all these partisanship and all this you know, challenges in  the country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASE:  The entrepreneurs are going to lead the way forward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Steve Case, good to see you, sir.  </p><p> CASE:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We appreciate it.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, September 28th.   Your top stories right now 07:35 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The testimonies are in.  Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and  his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testifying on Capitol Hill yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER:  The details that --  about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget.   They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an  adult.  </p><p> JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I swear  today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and  God, I am innocent of this charge.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The Senate Judiciary Committee set to vote based on their  testimonies this morning at 9:30 a.m.  So far, we know that Republican  Senator Bob Corker has said he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh as did  Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p> Futures this morning show the markets will open lower.  We are at the lows  of the morning right here, Dow Industrials down 90 points, that's a third  of a percent.  S&amp;P also down a third of a percent, as is the NASDAQ with a  decline of 30 points.  </p><p> These after the major indices finished higher yesterday.  As you can see,  gains across the board, NASDAQ best performer, up two thirds of a percent  yesterday, up 51 points.  </p><p> As we wrap up the third quarter, the Dow Industrials is up almost nine  percent for the quarter.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 up seven percent for  the third quarter.  Of course, the fourth quarter begins on Monday.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, the markets are lower.  Take a look.  FT-100 down  three quarters of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down better than one  percent.  And the DAX Index is down 1-2/3 percent right now.  </p><p> Asian markets finished mostly positive with the exception of Korea as you  can see.  </p><p> A terror plot was foiled overseas, we have the incredible footage of police  nabbing a group of terror suspects armed with suicide vests and assault  rifles.  </p><p> Plus, recall alert.  We've got the details on why Honda is recalling more  than 200,000 vehicles.  The malfunction that could put you in danger.  </p><p> And meet HAL, he's the incredible and realistic robot that's helping train  the next generation of medical professionals.  He'll be here in studio with  us in just a few minutes.  You've got to meet HAL.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p> But first, the top story this half an hour, meeting postponed.  The White  House announcing yesterday that President Trump will not be meeting with  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until next week.  This as fox is  just confirming conservative GOP leaders in the House have reached a deal  to bring in Rosenstein for a closed door session meeting to discuss the New  York Times story about potentially recording the president and invoking the  25th amendment to remove President Trump.  It is not clear, however, if  Rosenstein will respond to that congressional request.  </p><p> Joining us right now is former White House press secretary under President  Trump, Senior advisor and spokesperson for America First Action PAC and the  author of The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President, Sean  Spicer.  Sean, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p> SEAN SPICER, SENIOR ADVISOR AND SPOKESPERSON, AMERICA FIRST ACTION PAC:   You bet.  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your take on President Trump's meeting with his deputy attorney  general?  </p><p> SPICER:  I think it's an important meeting.  Obviously you need to make  sure that there's a chemistry and relationship and a degree of trust by  those you appoint and those are executing important duties throughout your  administration.  But the president rightly postponed this in light of the  other news that's going on with respect to the Supreme Court.  </p><p> But you know, look, I think that there's a lot about how this thing went  down in terms of the reporting of it, whether it was -- whether it happened  at all, whether it was a joke, an offended comment that was taken out of  context.  And I think the president needs to sit down as he's going to do  with Mr. Rosenstein and say explain yourself to me, what happened, what did  you mean, did it really happen?  And there's a lot of extremes that go into  that question.  Either it really didn't happen or it did happen.  And if it  did happen, was he joking around and you know, what was the context in  which it was said.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because there's more to it, right, Sean?  I mean, Rod  Rosenstein was the one who signed off on the third FISA warrant to wiretap  Carter Page.  He wrote a letter to fire Jim Comey and then was upset with  the president when the president said that's one of the reasons why he  fired him.  </p><p> And of course, he's been sitting on documents that congress wants to  investigate how they came up with this narrative that Trump had anything to  do with the Russia meddling.  </p><p> SPICER:  Right.  And I think I'll go back to what I said initially Maria,  which is, look, these are people that have been appointed by the president  of the United States to serve in his administration.  He was elected by the  American people.  And that if these people don't feel comfortable with the  policies and agenda that he has, then they have an obligation to resign.  </p><p> And so, I think the president needs to be able to look in this case Mr.  Rosenstein in the eye and say explain yourself to me.  If you're not doing  what I have asked you to do in terms of the Department of Justice and the  actions and policies that I want implemented, then you need to go.  You  should not be undermining me or opposing this agenda in any way, shape or  form.  And so, that's a conversation that the two of them need to have.  </p><p> But as you mentioned, all those aforementioned issues are important and I  think we need to make it clear, that these aren't independent agencies that  can go do whatever they want.  They are appointed to serve and execute the  policies and agenda of the president of the United States.  </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, its Liz Peek.  Good morning.  It does  seem to me that the president is somewhat boxed in.  In other words, this  has been an incredibly compromising news story about Rosenstein.  The  question is, if he gets rid of Rosenstein, who is next?  I mean, is there a  succession possibility here that's going to satisfy supporters of President  Trump?  </p><p> SPICER:  Well, I mean, obviously the president selects those individuals.   So, I don't know that they have a succession plan in place right now.  But  I'm sure that there's a ton of qualified individuals either within the  department that could be elevated and nominated to that position.  Noel  Francisco who's the number of the current Solicitor General I think by  statute and order would take over certain aspects of the job.  </p><p> But I think there's a fundamental threshold question that needs to get  asked first, which is, you know, whether or not the aspects of this New  York Times story were accurate in the first place.  So, I'm less worried  about the replacement than I am about the nut of the story.</p><p> And as I mentioned at the outset, I think there's a big difference between  whether it happened at all and then sort of the degrees, if it happened,  was its an offhanded joke that is trying to make Mr. Rosenstein look bad in  the eyes of the president knowing that something like this might tick him  off.  </p><p> So, I think first and foremost before we start talking about replacements,  we need to understand the context of the story and whether or not any of  the aspects are true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  We want to turn to the House Judiciary  Committee.  House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a subpoena for  the memos related to the former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the so  called McCabe memos, writing to attorney general Jeff Sessions this.  Given  the department's ongoing delays and or refusal to produce these documents,  I'm left with no choice but to issue the enclosed subpoena to compel their  production.  </p><p> What effect is this going to have do you think -- we've seen subpoenas  before.  Are we going to see these memos?  </p><p> SPICER:  Well, I hope so.  We're not talking about necessarily putting them  in the public domain.  But the members have a right, a constitutional right  to oversight and the idea that a Republican House is being stymied by a  Republican run Department of Justice --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SPICER:  -- is mind boggling.  So, I don't know why it's taking Chairman  Goodlatte to go to the length of a subpoena.  They should be able to come  to terms privately and meet in closed session, or however -- you know,  whatever form is appropriate to review these things.  But this is somewhat  out of -- out of norm that you have the same party having this discussion.   So I think it's -- I would behoove the Department of Justice to work with  Chairman Goodlatte and the Republican leadership in the House to satisfy  this requests.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Maybe they just don't want to see what's in these memos,  right?  Because what did Trey Gowdy say Dagen, that it's an embarrassment  because we're going to actually see how they came up with this idea that  Trump had anything to do with the Russia scandal. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  An embarrassment to John  Brennan.  (INAUDIBLE) And he didn't think that there was anything new in  there for the most part.  That's not going to be any great shockers in the  memos.  </p><p> SPICER:  And the thing -- the other thing that I would add in this is that,  for all these people who constantly are crying about transparency, here we  have another instance of trying to get more information to understand  what's going on and it seems that so many people are actually trying to  prevent us from having a greater understanding of what's really going on.   For all the people who care about Russia and this collusion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SPICER:  Well, here's another way to find out what's the basis of this,  what is that information.  We're not -- again, we're not talking about  putting it out publicly.  It's members of Congress exercising their  constitutional responsibility.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, and this speaks volumes, doesn't it?  </p><p> SPICER:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sean, thank you so much. </p><p> SPICER:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sean Spicer joining us.</p><p> Coming up, a major terror plot was foiled.  The developments after police  in the Netherlands arrest seven suspects.  </p><p> Then, a huge recall for Honda to report.  Details on the automakers  malfunctions software in certain vehicles.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Get this, police in the Netherlands foiling a major terrorist  plot.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, this as an amazing  video and it shows the dramatic moment Maria, when heavily armed Dutch  police, check this out, they arrested terrorists suspects in a raid in a  parking lot.  Authorities say there were seven men who planned to use  suicide vests, assault rifles and car bombs targeting at least two  locations.  Fortunately that attack foiled.  About 400 officers took part  in a series of raids.  There they are.  The alleged ring leader of 34 old  Iraqi was previously convicted of attempting to travel overseas to join  extremist groups.  </p><p> Well, a recall from Honda this morning, about 232,000 2018 Accords and 2019  Insight hybrid in the U.S. could have a software problem.  The rear camera  display doesn't work when the cars are put into reverse.  Honda says there  have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to this potential  problem.  Shares of the company down 11 percent this year.  </p><p> And we are getting the first glimpse of Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers for the  upcoming movie about the beloved children's show host.  Looks pretty good.   The photo Sony has released shows a gray haired hanks in Rogers signature  red sweater.  That was the sweater he wore on Mr. Rogers neighborhood.  The  film will follow the story of a reporter who developed an emotional bond  with Rogers while profiling him for a magazine.  Production started this  month.  It hits theaters next October.  I loved that show growing up, that  red sweater, I forgot all about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  Taking the shoes off.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming  up, talk about a realistic robot.  Check this out, we got details on a new  machine that can bleed, scream and cry and HAL the robot is in studio.   Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The future of medical training may be in the hands of robots.   Gaumard Scientific has created HAL, a realistic child robot for medical  training that can cry, bleed and react like a real child patient.  We have  HAL here on the set today.  </p><p> And joining me right now is Gaumard Scientific corporate planning vice  president James Archetto and Dr.  Mikhail Varshavski also known as Dr.  Mike.  Great to see everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> James, let me start with you.  Tell us about HAL and what was the  inspiration for creating HAL?  </p><p> JAMES ARCHETTO, CORPORATE PLANNING VICE PRESIDENT, GAUMARD SCIENTIFIC:  HAL  is really designed Maria for training physicians, nurses, first responders.   What we want is physicians and health care practitioners to really be  prepared for those critical situations with patients before they ever get  there.  So this is a chance for them to really learn a clinically accurate  patient.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how does HAL do that?  </p><p> ARCHETTO:  HAL does that by the combination of electronics, software and  hydraulics inside.  So you can see his eyes are moving now.  He has facial  expressions.  </p><p> And the reason for that, is physicians get a lot of information from that  and 5-year-olds don't always talk and don't always provide that information  verbally.  So, we had to do it in a way with several motors and electronics  and software.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dr. Mike, you're a practicing doctor.  We're seeing the video  of HAL getting blood taken from him.  </p><p> DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE:  Yes, I mean, when I  was training we didn't have simulations this real.  We had a basic dummy  that didn't move.  And you'd be doing chest compressions, he's best you  would hear a click to know that you were doing chest compressions in the  right way.  Here, it sounds like you have the entire picture.  You have the  emotional feedback.  You have visual feedback.  You can do procedures on  him.  </p><p> And when you -- I know, you mentioned earlier in one of the segments that  you don't want him to look too realistic.  Because you were worried about  being traumatic to medical students.  What was traumatic to me as a medical  student was going into my first surgery rotation and not knowing what to do  because I didn't have experience on such a high level simulator.  </p><p> So, having this experience, knowing how to do the procedures, being able to  look at a child and seeing it react back and forth with me, that's  priceless.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How will you react, though?  I mean, James, walk us through  some of the medical scenarios that HAL can actually replicate.  </p><p> ARCHETTO:  Sure.  Let's say that a child goes into respiratory distress,  asthmatic on a plain field.  For example, playing soccer goes in -- has an  asthmatic attack, goes into respiratory distress.  HAL will respond  appropriately to that.  He can actually be intubated to help him breathe.   If he goes into cardiac arrest, he can be defibrillated with real energy.  </p><p> So, as Dr. Mike was describing, those real clinical experiences can take  place right here on HAL.  And you know, so, I'm controlling him from a  tablet here.  He's not plugged in.  He's completely untethered Maria  because accidents take place wherever not always in the hospital.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, this would be helpful to you?  </p><p> VARSHAVSKI:  So, this would be helpful to everybody.  Because we're talking  about nurses, we're talking about first responders, we're talking about  training physicians.  And in reality, you never know what to expect in the  situations.  So, the more simulations you can be put in as a trainee, the  better you're going to react when the time comes to make a decision.  </p><p> Because it's really traumatic in the scene of an injury, in the scene of  someone having an asthma attack, your mind starts racing.  And if you don't  have experience with a simulated patient before that, it makes it really  hard to make the right decision.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the downside risk here, James?  I mean, I understand the  benefits of having HAL as you very articulately -- as you very articulated  it, but is there a downside here?  I mean, robots are getting better and  better and better.  </p><p> ARCHETTO:  Yes, remember, his objective is training.  He's an educational  aide to facilitate folks like Dr. Mike in their training experience.  So  from that standpoint, the objective is to really focus on those clinical  experiences.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, the hair is really amazing.  Look at this.  This is great.   Great stuff, guys.  Thanks very much, James Archetto, Dr.  Mike, great -- a  pleasure.  Thank you, HAL. </p><p> ARCHETTO:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  An education every day.  </p><p> Still ahead, renewed trouble for Tesla, the latest controversy for CEO Elon  Musk after the Securities and Exchange Commission sues him for fraud,  that's next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Smith.  And the Hill Columnist, Fox News Contributor Liz Peek back with  us.  Great to see you.</p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  What a great day to be  here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a great day to be here after such an incredible day  yesterday.  Riveting.</p><p> GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Riveting.  I think you'd have to  say all the news is -- not only yesterday but then you throw in some of the  businesses like the SEC allegations, it's interesting times.</p><p> PEEK:  And the loss is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were expecting something to happen with Elon Musk givn the  lat couple of months there.</p><p> SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the hearing, you and I spoke about this yesterday.  We  wanted to text during it, we were both glued to it.  Your reaction Dagen.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, ANCHOR:  Here was a man who defended  himself with passion, with force, with emotion, and even at times some  anger rightfully so.</p><p> This is a man wrongfully accused and he was outraged by his treat -- the  treatment that he's received by the democrats and coordinated smear  campaign, a coordinated character assassination.  And he was angry for  himself, his career, his reputation destroyed, and he was angry for his  family rightfully so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And one of the best -- one of the best moments, speaking of his  family, was when he spoke of his daughter, his 10-year-old daughter who  said --</p><p> PEEK:  Praying for Dr. Ford which is an extraordinary concept and good for  him.  I mean, it made it so human it seems to me.  And so -- and, you know,  one of the things we've heard about him all along with how open-minded he  is, he -- this is to all different points of view and so forth on the  bench.</p><p> And I thought that was sort of -- this is another indication that this is a  man who really does entertain a wide spectrum of beliefs and commentary and  so forth for him to have talked to his children about her accusations in a  way that persuaded them to pray for her which is extraordinary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Speaking of her accusations, Christine Blasey-Ford's testimony  was gripping to say the least.  Nevertheless, we come out of this hearing  with no corroboration of her allegations and no supporting evidence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even by all -- we have a new letter from Mark Judge that says  that, \"I have no knowledge of this party.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He sent another letter to the Judiciary Committee.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the four people who she talked about being with her  including her best friend, this woman Leland also said they do not remember  what she's talking about.  I mean, it was just extraordinary.  And leading  up to yesterday's testimony, it truly was a sad day for America as people  threw out due process altogether.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Lindsey Graham had one of the brightest shining moments in  political history --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He really did.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in modern political history yesterday because he spoke for  how -- so many Americans and how they feel with characteristic, bluntness,  and fire of a southerner.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's show some of that right now.  We've got a great  show coming up.  Joining the conversation, White House Senior Advisor for  Strategic Communication, Mercedes Schlapp is with us.  House Financial  Services Committee Members, Republican and Democratic New York  Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p> The CEO of Delta Airlines will join me, Ed Bastian is here, along with  former AOL CEO, Revolution Chairman and CEO Steve Case.  Plus, Economist  Nouriel Roubini will navigate the economy for us and assess where we are in  terms of this strong performance.</p><p> First though our top story right here and that is emotions running high on  Capitol Hill yesterday, Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his  accuser Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford testifying before the Senate Judiciary  Committee offering drastically different accounts during the high-stakes  hearing, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FORD:  I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I would  like to.  But the details that -- about that night that bring me here today  are the ones I will never forget.  They have been seared into my memory and  have haunted me episodically as an adult.</p><p> Indelible in the (INAUDIBLE) campus is the laughter, the laugh -- the  uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense.  </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Dr. Ford, to what degree of certainty do  you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  </p><p> FORD:  One hundred percent.  </p><p> DURBIN:  One hundred percent.</p><p> KAVANAUGH:  Less than two weeks ago Dr. Ford publicly accused me of  committing wrong doing at an event more than 36 years ago when we were both  in high school.  I denied the allegation immediately, categorically, and  unequivocally.</p><p> This confirmation process has become a national disgrace, the constitution  gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process.  But you  have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.  This whole two- week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled  with apparent pen up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.</p><p> Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on  behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars and money from outside left  wing opposition groups.  This is a circus.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And after all of that the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote  today at 9:30a.m.  Here now Criminal Defense Attorney, former Sex Crimes  Prosecutor, Nichole DeBorde.  Nicole, thanks very much for being here, your  take from a legal perspective this morning.</p><p>NICOLE DEBORDE, ATTORNEY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE:  You know, I think one of the  big issues here is that this very sort of accusation goes on in courtrooms  across America and certainly in my jurisdiction on a daily basis based on  the word of one individual with no corroborating evidence whatsoever.</p><p> And there are men and women, there are people in prison over the word of  one person and it may be time to rethink how we -- how we see these cases  and how we handle evidence presented in these cases?  At the end of the  day, whatever happens in this vote this morning, Judge Kavanaugh is going  to go home to his family.  There are many people in this exact same  circumstance who are just not so fortunate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, yesterday the Sex Prosecutor Mitchell painted a  picture and interviewed Dr. Ford in a way that really brought out some  important issues about her whether it was she had a lot of memory lapses.</p><p> She said initially she was afraid to fly and then she had all of these  trips that she had gone on, from Indonesia, to California, Hawaii.  She  also couldn't remember some important things like how she got to the party  and how she left.  What was your take on Mitchell's performance before  Senator Lindsey Graham really put a -- put a point to everything?</p><p>DEBORDE:  I thought that it was a -- it was a very smart move to have her  do the questioning.  She clearly was a very experienced questioner, knew  the types of issues that would concern people.  Knew how to address all  kinds of things related to memory, detail, you know, facts surrounding the  main allegation that was made that I think help shed light on, you know,  answers to questions that will help people determine her credibility.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm going to bring you the panel in a moment.  But let's  get to Lindsey Graham for a moment because he said yesterday what many  people were thinking.  Here's Lindsey Graham lashing out pointing his anger  squarely at democrats.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  What you  want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this open and hope you win in  2020, you said that.  When you see Sotomayor and Kagan, tell them that  Lindsey said hello because I voted for them.  I would never do to them what  you've done to this guy.  This is the most unethical sham since I've been  in politics. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good for the senator.  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He spoke for a lot of people in this country --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He sure did.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- who is angry at the treatment, the coordinated attack by the  democrats and angry.  And by the way, people were chastising Brett  Kavanaugh for his anger, if I was sitting in that seat and I have been  treated that way, I would have gone yards and miles further than what he  did.  </p><p> I would have been pointing -- but Brett Kavanaugh did a smart thing  yesterday because he had those democrats beginning with Dianne Feinstein  back on her heels.  It -- their one line -- their one talking point  yesterday was let the FBI investigate this, let the FBI investigate this in  between quizzing Brett Kavanaugh about --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More delay.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- drinking games in his high school yearbook.  So that raises  the question.  Dianne Feinstein have this letter in late July, she sat down  with Brett Kavanaugh --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investigate it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- on August the 20th.  If they had immediately taken this  information to Chuck Grassley and to the republicans on Judiciary  Committee, they could have done a lot more.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They didn't want to.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So that raises the question.  She denied leaking it, she denied  leaking the letter or and -- people on her staff.  But, again, why did they  sit on it?  We know why, to delay it past the midterms and that was crystal  clear yesterday.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p> PEEK:  Well -- and also I think the republicans did a good job.  They all  did a good job of making it seem like a political hit job.  And to your  point, not only did they delay that and not have an investigation into the  letter, there were -- they had any number of opportunities to question  Kavanaugh about some of these things and they failed to do so.</p><p> So I think what -- what's interesting to me is the change and sentiment if  you measure it by the odds of his confirmation, various betting sites it  went from 100 percent he's not going to get confirmed to by the time he was  finished and the time some -- and Lindsey Graham spoke it was like, yes,  he's going to go through it 57 percent.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They kept -- the democrats kept pushing Chuck Grassley on  bringing these witnesses who can -- who do not corroborate Christine  Blasey-Ford's story in front of the committee to hear from them publicly.</p><p> We have a new letter from FOX News from Mark Judge that was sent to  Grassley and Dianne Feinstein.  He said, \"As a recovering alcoholic and a  cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety.  As a  result, I have to wait to speak public speaking.\"  </p><p> And he said, \"Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school.  We have  not spoken directly in several years.  I do not recall the events described  by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee today.  I never  saw Brett act in a manner Dr. Ford describes.  I am knowingly submitting  this letter under penalty of felony.\"  To put an exclamation point on it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There is no corroboration of this woman's story.</p><p> PEEK:  And by the way, the other witnesses also had letters that were under  penalty of perjury.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> PEEK:  I mean, these were serious affidavit that this did not happen or  they -- at least they do not remember.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And all the so-called bystanders which then she had to change  to say, \"Oh no, he was downstairs, he actually wasn't a bystander.\"  Said,  \"I have no knowledge of any of this.\"  </p><p>Nicole, let's get to the vote today, do -- what do you think happens today  at the vote?  Do they have the vote at 9:30 as we're expecting in the  committee?</p><p>DEBORDE:  I think they do have the vote.  And I think that it's -- you  know, after this vote is had I think it's time to start having some real  serious discussions about how we handle these cases in a criminal court  setting.</p><p> This is a person who had an opportunity to come out and tell her story just  like she was in a court of law and we can see now very publicly what kind  of damage that can do when you don't have any physical evidence whatsoever.   And people are in prison, like I said all over this country for exactly the  same thing without a similar public forum.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So very quickly, we'll see a vote in the Committee at 9:30, do  you -- then is the timeline that then we'll see the big vote for the Senate  on Tuesday?  And do you think he gets confirmed?  Very quickly.</p><p>DEBORDE:  You know, that's hard for me to guess, you know, I have my doubts  at this point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Thank you so much Nicole.  Good to see you.  The president  also has tweeted out support for the nominee saying this, \"Judge Kavanaugh  showed America exactly why I nominated him, his testimony was powerful,  honest, and riveting.\"</p><p> \"Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has  been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist, the Senate  must vote.\"  Thanks very much for joining us, we appreciate it.  We will  see you soon.</p><p> Coming up, Elon Musk in the SEC cross hairs, Tesla stock is plummeting this  morning, the agency brings a suit against Elon Musk.  We break that down  next.</p><p> And then up close and personal with an asteroid, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A passenger jet crashes into water in Micronesia  and dozens of passengers needed to be rescued.  Lauren Simonetti with the  details, Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And miraculously Maria they  were.  Official say the Boeing 737 crashed into a lagoon, there it is, as  it was landing remarkably everyone on that flight survives.  Here's how one  of those survivors described the pretty scary landing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought we landed hard until I look over and saw a  hole on the side of the plane, the water was coming in.  I was really  impressed with the locals who immediately started coming out in boats.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  He seemed so calm.  Investigators are trying to determine what  caused that crash.  Wow.  But it was a tragic engine -- ending to a plane  that crashed in Greenville, South Carolina.  Two of the pilots were killed  and a couple was seriously injured after a jet skidded of a runway and then  split into two, that accident also under investigation.</p><p> Well JCPenney Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Davis is resigning.  He's the  third top executives to leave JCPenney this year after CEO Marvin Ellison  and Chief Custom -- Customer Officer Joe McFarland left the company.  Jerry  Murray, Senior Vice President of finance will assume the position of  interim CFO.  JCPenney stock ugly chart, down about 40 percent this year.</p><p> And check this out, newly released images from Japan's space agency show  what it's like to stand on an asteroid, pretty rocky services I'd imagine.   These pictures were taken by a three inch tall hopping rover on the  asteroid (INAUDIBLE), more than 200 million miles away from earth.  They  show like I said that rocky surface and then you can see -- you can see the  sun moving across the sky in one of the pictures as well.  There it is  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  What a visual.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's amazing how technology can do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  200 million miles away.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Coming up, Elon Musk in the crosshairs as Securities and  Exchange Commission targets the CEO of Tesla for misleading investors in  that tweet.  We are breaking down the suit -- this suit coming up.</p><p> And then what is I do?  One Jeopardy contestant winning a big on air  marriage proposal, we've got the moments jeopardy.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Elon Musk is under fire this morning, the  Securities and Exchange Commission laying out the details of its lawsuit  against the CEO of Tesla.  It all stands for Musk's tweet last month  alleging he secured funding to take Tesla private.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today, the SEC filed securities fraud charges against  Elon Musk.  The chairman and CEO of Tesla Motors stemming from his August  2018 statements decimated over tweeter that he was considering taking Tesla  private.\"</p><p> \"We alleged that Musk's statements were false and misleading because they  lack any business and facts. The SEC's complaint which was filed earlier  today in federal district of New York seeks a finding that Musk committed  security (INAUDIBLE).  And injunction prohibiting him from doing so in the  future, civil penalties, discouragement of any ill-gotten gains and a bar  prohibiting Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company  in the future.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Musk has refunded in the lawsuit in a statement he said this,  \"This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened disappointed.   I've always taken across and the best of truth transparency and investors.   Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I  never compromise this in any way.\"</p><p> Joining us right now is the Wall Street Journal's Technology and Autos  Reporter, Tim Higgins.  Tim, thanks very much weighing in.  Your reaction  to this, is this the beginning of the end for Elon Musk?</p><p> TIM HIGGINS, TECHNOLOGY &amp; AUTO REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well  surprising how quickly the SEC moved on this.  These things usually take,  you know, months if not years.  Here, they are out, you know, weeks  afterwards really suggest that it's -- to them an open and shut case.  You  know, it could spell some trouble for Tesla really without Elon Musk at the  -- at the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's what I'm going to ask you about.  But first, let  me get your reaction Gary.</p><p> SMITH:  Well there's two takeaways, one is normally the SEC settles these  things far beyond far ahead of the actions like this.  two, I'll ask Tim, I  think if a mosque is removed that it destroys Tesla, what are your  thoughts.</p><p>DEBORDE:  That's a -- that's a good question.  They -- you know, there's  not a lot of companies where the CEO the brand are so intertwined, how  you've seen the stock has swore in recent years and that's a large part  because of investor enthusiasm for Elon Musk's vision of the future,  personal transportation.</p><p> So not having Elon Musk there could spell, you know , some trouble for them  raising funds, they need to probably raise some money.  You know, are  people going to be as excited to be in that stock?  Are they going to be as  excited to be buying the cars?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stock is down 10 percent Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tim, and it raises an issue in terms of the SEC is looking to  bar Elon Musk from being a -- its top executive from serving as an officer  or director of any U.S. public company.  It raises the issue of the SEC is  in a position where they're going to wipe out potentially the shareholder - - $50 billion in shareholder value.</p><p> When they do (INAUDIBLE) a little to actually protect small individual  investors, they have to think about that and maybe Elon Musk is looking at  say, Mark Cuban saying, \"I could fight this, clear my name.  I'm not  settling.\"</p><p> HIGGINS:  Yes.  And in a lot of ways this is almost classic Elon Musk.  He  likes to pushback when he feels like he's wrong.  We reported that perhaps  there was a negotiation for a settlement that the SEC thought they had and  then Elon's lawyers called them and said, \"No, we're going to -- we're not  going to go that route.\"</p><p> If you look at his statements following that tweet in August and since then  he is really been making the case and in his mind e thought the funding was  there.  Of course, the SEC is saying not so fast but it really gets to this  kind of the way Silicon Valley is operating.</p><p> You know, to be an entrepreneur like him, he has to kind of create his own  reality.  You know, he was told for many years he couldn't make electric  cars cool, he's been able to do that.  And we've seen him in recent years  really pushback against regulators and, you know, let them do -- let him do  the things he wants to do.</p><p> PEEK:  Tim, it's Liz Peek.  Good morning.  What do you think about the  succession issue here?</p><p> HIGGINS:  Well that's a -- that's a -- it's a huge question.  You know,  basically the last two years or so it seen a huge exodus of top executives  from the company, it's not an easy place to work.  In recent months we've  seen the top sales executive and the top -- and the engineering chief  leave.</p><p> These are people that would have been maybe perhaps natural number twos, or  people that could take the -- take the wheel if you will.  But now they're  gone and if the bench is not very deep.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way you just said he said he  believe when he did  the tweet that he had the funding, are you saying you believe the funding  at $420 a share or was that some kind of a joke?</p><p> HIGGINS:  Well, you know, he -- the complaints that we read there he  basically said, well I got to do a premium on where the stock is, it's  going to be at $419, you know, $420 that would be funny, maybe that would  impress his girlfriend.</p><p> You know, in previous blog posts that he's put out, he's essentially made  the case that, \"Hey, had some meetings with the Saudi, of the Southern  wealth fund.  He thought that they wanted to help them take the company  private, he could get something done.  But, yes, the SEC is basically  saying, \"Hey, you didn't have this like locked in.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, of course.  Tim, thanks very much for weighing in, we  appreciate it.  We sort of saw this coming, we reacted this way as soon as  that tweet came out on this program I remember.  Tim Higgins, thank you,  from the Wall Street Journal.  </p><p> Coming up, price to win, Boeing snagging a multibillion dollar Air Force  contact, we'll tell you all about it when we come back.</p><p> And then technology transforms the way you travel, I'm sitting down with  the CEO of Delta Airlines, Edward Bastian is here, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, September 28th, your  top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Showdown on Capitol Hill, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his  accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testifying in D.C., on a sexual misconduct  allegations against Kavanaugh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Of what degree of certainty do you believe Brett  Kavanaugh assaulted you?</p><p> DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, KAVANAUGH ACCUSER:  One hundred percent.</p><p> KAVANAUGH:  I was not at the party described by Doctor Ford.  This  confirmation process has become a national disgrace.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will have much more on the fiery hearing yesterday, ahead of  today's judiciary committee vote coming up.  Already, we know, that Bob  Corker said he will vote yes for Kavanagh.</p><p> Futures this morning, show the markets will open lower, Dow Industrials  down 75 points, that's almost a third of a percent lower, S&amp;P 500 down  seven points, and the NASDAQ up 20 points, a quarter of a percent lower.</p><p> This after the markets were higher yesterday, Dow Industrials picking up 50  points at the close, 54 points higher, a quarter of a percent.  The S&amp;P was  up a quarter of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 52-point move up, up two- thirds of one percent.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are lower, the FT-100, the CAC Quarante and  the DAX Index down in the negative territory.  The DAX Index in Germany  down 1-1/2 percent right now.</p><p> Asian markets meanwhile, finishing mostly positive overnight, best  performer there was Japan, up one and a third percent.  In Korea, the KOSPI  was down one half of a percent.</p><p> Sanctuary setback, a California judge deals a blow to the states' law,  protecting illegal immigrants, and aiming high, the details behind Boeing's  multi-billion-dollar contract with the U.S. Air Force.</p><p> Then, this, excitement on the gridiron, the Rams beat the Vikings in what  could be the best game of the season.  We've got all the highlights coming  up, this morning.</p><p> Talk about a proposal in jeopardy, a contestant on the popular quiz show,  Jeopardy, popping the question of his own.  We have the adorable video,  coming up, right here.</p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, technology transforming travel,  Delta Air Lines is preparing to launch the first biometric terminal in the  country.  Certain terminals at the Atlanta International Airport will be  equipped with facial recognition technology from curb to gate, expected to  become fully operational later this year.</p><p> Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive interview with the CEO of  Delta Air Lines, Edward Bastian, Edward, it's great to see you, thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p> EDWARD BASTIAN, CEO, DELTA AIR LINES:  Thanks, Maria.  It's great to be  here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is really exciting stuff.  Tell me what you are expecting  and how this will work.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Well, yes, we've transformed many parts of the travel experience  for customers' stay, but the area that I think needs the most assistance  right now is the airports, the airport environment going through security,  with the gate and boarding process.</p><p> And we've been partnered with CBP, Customs and Border Patrol, to create a  frictionless, paperless entry process, both, as you exit the country and as  you -- as you return to the country for international travel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually, this facial recognition has been successful for  government because they are catching illegals coming in, as well.</p><p> BASTIAN:  It's incredibly effective.  It's the most efficient technology  we've seen from a secure perspective and it also speeds the access through  the airport quite quickly.  It's great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  As you incorporate more technology into operations, what are  the cost looking like?  Is this going to impact expenses in a big way, next  year?</p><p> BASTIAN:  It's not.  You know, we are investing heavily in technology  because we are driving a lot of customer improvement, enhancements.  It is  driving revenue performance.  It's driving some productivity enhancements.   But, you know, a lot of this we are talking about now is basic  infrastructure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The company has been doing so well.  Where does the growth come  from out five years?</p><p> BASTIAN:  Out five years, I think, it's going to be global.  For the last  few years, we focus largely on the U.S. marketplace, New York, L.A.,  Seattle, the coasts on both sides, international has been a little more  challenging and it's good to see that demand is really strong, this year,  international, as well as domestic.</p><p> And we've been growing internationally, all year, and I think the outlook  for international growth is going to be quite promising.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  I was taking with the CEO of Boeing, about the  same topic, and he said a large percentage of the people in the world have  never been on a plane.</p><p> BASTIAN:  The U.S. marketplace is largely mature for air travel, you know,  there's a lot new places to fly.  We're building bigger airplanes and  bigger airports, but not new markets to travel to.</p><p> So, the opportunity whether to Asia, Latin America, even into Europe, I  think, is going to be the future and Africa, as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's terrific, very exciting.  So, the growth story  will still be the U.S., but also incorporate a lot more potential  international.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Yes, the U.S. is always our home market, two-thirds of our  revenue is in the majority of our profits are here in the U.S.  But long- term, I'm thinking 5 years, I'm thinking 10, 20, 30 years from now.  It's  going to be international.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's terrific.  Tell me about the changes you're making to  the fleet, this is also important, a lot of analysts, talking about this as  the major growth proposal, as well.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Right.  With all the infrastructure constraints we have in the  U.S., air traffic control and some of the other congestion issues, one of  our strategies is to the deal with that is to build some larger airplanes  so that we're not -- we don't have as much friction in the sky.</p><p> And so, you need larger airplanes, larger airports, but it's not going to  be, you know, the air traffic control systems that we need built, are  probably years away, in terms of being able to accommodate more travelers.   There are no new landing slots here in LaGuardia or JFK.  They're already  at maximum capacity.</p><p> So, we need bigger capacity, and that's why we're putting bigger planes on  our markets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's more comfortable for passengers, as well, by the way.</p><p> BASTIAN:  It's more comfortable, it's more fuel-efficient, it's more fuel  effective, from an environmental perspective.  The new planes that we're  bringing in are about 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the planes that  we're retiring.  And it's a much better experience all around.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how does that jive with what you have in terms of the  airports right now?  I mean, you look overseas, you've got beautiful, large  airports, and then, like, you mentioned JFK and LaGuardia.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will they be able to accommodate these larger planes?</p><p> BASTIAN:  They will.  We're investing in the airports, as well.  We've got  the biggest investment project in our history, going on right now at  LaGuardia Airport.  It is $3-1/2 billion rebuild of LaGuardia.  It's going  to take several years to get done.  We're going to be opening the first  concourse in the next 18 months.</p><p> So, it's not that far away.  But we have similar projects going in L.A.   We're building a brand new airport, LAX, new international facility in  Seattle, brand new airport in Salt Lake City.  We've just completed a big  modernization in Atlanta.</p><p> So, $12 billion of airport infrastructure that Delta is putting in, in  place, in the U.S. and, you know, five years from now, I think we're going  to have some great airports.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's fantastic because -- and that infrastructure move could  be a partnership government, as well as private sector, right?</p><p> BASTIAN:  We do work effectively -- with our -- with our municipalities,  with our local governments, absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, earlier this week, the House passed legislation  that would establish a minimum standard for a leg room on commercial  flights.  The Bill now moves to the Senate.  If it passes in the Senate,  how would the changes impact Delta?  Because it seems like you are doing  exactly what they are just talking about in Washington.</p><p> BASTIAN:  We are doing exactly what they're talking about.  And we're no  concerned.  It's -- the FAA Bill is instructed the DOT to look after the  safety, relative to seat pitch of the airlines.  We're confident that our  airplanes -- because we haven't touched our seat pitch in years.</p><p> At Delta, our product standards have -- are not being compromised.  We  don't think it's going to be an issue for Delta, and I doubt it's going to  be an issue for the industry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  All good news here, and yet, just recently, your  experience, a tough day, now you have a technical glitch, caused a  nationwide grounding on Tuesday.  There were only three cancellations,  amazingly.</p><p> Delta had to delay more than 660 flights, though, according to FlightAware.   A lot of people were talking about how the Delta folks really responded  well bringing Dunkin' Donuts to people, helping them get through it.   Nobody likes travel, hell.  But tell us what happened that day and how the  firm responded.</p><p> BASTIAN:  We had a glitch in some of our departure technology that allows  us to push our planes back from the gate.  It caused about a 30-minute  ground stop for systems, so it did cause some disruption, as you say, it  was minimal, relative to cancellations and as well as delays.</p><p> You know, one of the things that we've been investing also and heavily, is  technology and infrastructure, and the ability to respond when we have some  of these glitches, if technologies are like flood, and we've got to create  continued improvement there to improve the processing.</p><p> But one of the things I was most proud of, is when you look at our  performance that day, relative to our major competitors, we still  outperformed our major competitors even with that small glitch, so team did  a great job.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They seem to have done a great job, you're right.  I mean, you  -- this is the way of life, you're going to have glitches in the airline  business, right?</p><p> BASTIAN:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's about how you respond to it.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Yes.  I would have said several years ago, that could have been  two, three, four hours to respond, to get it done.  We got it done  actually, in 26 minutes.  It was pretty -- it was pretty quick.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I know that when I am on a Delta flight, there you are in  the video.  I mean, you are right, front and center.  You want the  employees, as well as the customers to know the buck stops with you.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you your take on what we're talking about in  terms of the intersection of business and social media.  We got this  growing number of CEOs turning to the online platforms, most recently, the  CEO of Tesla, obviously, with this tweet.</p><p> Now, the SCC is looking into it and actually bringing a lawsuit.  What's  your take on going that far in terms of tweeting, as a CEO of a public  company?</p><p> BASTIAN:  Well, I don't tweet.  That's one of the things I have stayed  away, though, I am on social media.  You know, I think today's customers  and especially the next generation of customers, look for leadership, and  they're looking for leadership in Washington.  They're looking for  leadership from their products, from the companies, and services that they  buy from.</p><p> And I don't think you can avoid being visible, as you say, you have  customers want to know where you stand on issues that affect your business  and affects your employees, and sometimes you have to take -- come out and  take a stand, but we try to be careful with where we position ourselves,  because the brand is incredibly important to us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's all you have.  You got your reputation.  Let me end on  the backdrop in terms of the climate today.  Ed, how do bookings look, what  are you expecting in terms of the economy going into 2019?</p><p> BASTIAN:  We are very optimistic.  We just finished the strongest summer  travel season in our history.  We expect to carry 200 million passengers  this year, largest in our history, and the (INAUDIBLE) is quite positive.   And the good thing, Maria, it's not just U.S. international.  It's also  business and leisure, so all sectors of our business are performing very,  very well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting to raise prices as a result of oil prices  are?</p><p> BASTIAN:  Well, you have to cover the cost and all prices have been a  significant increase for us, so we are looking at about $2 billion-dollar  or higher fuel bill this year, than last year.  But despite that, our  overall profit level for this year is going to be roughly the same as it  was last year.</p><p> So, we've been able to cover the cost in various ways, some price increases  have gone into effect, but also a lot of productivity and a lot of  improvements in our network that's also allowed us to drive that  efficiency.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you believe this narrative that the broad economic backdrop  slows down quite a bit, within the next two years going into 2020?</p><p> BASTIAN:  Yes, we haven't seen it.  You read the headlines.  You would  anticipate that with tariffs and the rhetoric that is going on.  Our  international business is the strongest I've seen in years, so we're  continuing to serve that demand and we're optimistic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations, Edward, great to see you.</p><p> BASTIAN:  Thanks, Maria.  Good to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Edward Bastian there, as the CEO at Delta  Air Lines.  Coming up, blast off, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, just landed a  major rocket deal.

President Donald Trump hosted a ceremonial swearing in ceremony for Kavanaugh at the White House on Monday night. And during the event, the president not only praised his pick, he also took a swipe at the women who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault calling it all a hoax. And then he said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Mr. Trump made those declarations as a new CNN poll shows that a majority of Americans, some 52 percent say they believe Kavanaugh's accusers. For his part, Kavanaugh says he starts his new job with, quote, \"no bitterness and that he hopes to be a unifying force.\" One place he could do that, well, four weeks from today, in the U.S. Midterms.</p><p>The president and his fellow Republicans hope to use Kavanaugh's bruising confirmation battle to rally the base. Now, CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip joins us now live, and Abby, again, the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, it was not a criminal trial and yet the U.S. president has passed judgment on Justice Kavanaugh. What did Trump say?</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That is exactly right, Kristie. The president, as you pointed out, first started by apologizing to the Kavanaugh's for the process. And then he talked about a basic principle of being innocent until proven guilty. But then he added another part, implying that Kavanaugh had been through some kind of trial, had been exonerated clearly in the eyes of the law, which he has not been. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILLIP): I think most people would not disagree with the first part of that quote, but it's the second part which the president seemed to ad lib on the end there, is what people would take issue with. There was, if you remember, a lot of controversy about the process here in the senate, there were only two witnesses, it was Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.</p><p>And then there was a very abbreviated FBI investigation that many said was limited in scope by the White House in an effort to prevent certain people from being questioned by the FBI as part of this investigation. But the president clearly not concerned about much of that at all and trying to focus on what he says is just a political unfairness directed toward his nominee.</p><p>LU STOUT: Kavanaugh, he begins his first day at the Supreme Court. This is a moment that Republicans have been dreaming of for decades and we are just a month out until the midterms. So how does the GOP -- how does Donald Trump -- how do they believe they can capitalize on Kavanaugh and the anger generated from the hearings?</p><p>PHILLIP: Well, this is something we're going to hear a lot about in the next couple of weeks. The president talking about Democrats as an angry mob, saying that they demonstrated that in the Kavanaugh process. The president here is really speaking to his base. Republicans have been worried that their own supporters would not come out in November, and now President Trump is predicting something totally different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILLIP: A man that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats, using the Democrats' lawyers and now they wan to impeach him. I have heard this from many people. I think it's an insult to the American public and I think you are going to see a lot of things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:05:14] PHILLIP: And the president there implying that the prospect that Democrats could try to impeach Justice Kavanaugh now would be enough to get his voters to maybe wake up before November and get to the polls. Already the Democratic enthusiasm is extremely high going into this election. What Republicans are hoping to do is get their folks engaged and out to the polls especially in some of the Senate races that will decide whether Democrats or Republicans take control of that important chamber.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, a number of Americans fired up ahead of these critical midterm elections. Abby Phillip reporting live from the White House. Abby, thank you.</p><p>And for Hillary Clinton, President Trump's decision to honor Kavanaugh at the White House was troubling for both the country and the court. And she spoke about her concerns in an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: What was done last night in the White House was a political rally. It further undermined the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly. It saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government.</p><p>So, I don't know how people are going to react to it. I think given our divides, it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against. But the president has been true to form. He has insulted, attacked, demeaned women throughout the campaign, really for many years leading up to the campaign. And he has continued to do that inside the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Tune in later for Christiane's full interview with Hillary Clinton. It airs 6:00 p.m. Tuesday in London, 1:00 a.m. Wednesday here in Hong Kong, right here on CNN.</p><p>Hurricane Michael is threatening nearly 500 kilometers of the U.S. Gulf Coast and is expected to strengthen into a dangerous major hurricane before making landfall in Florida on Wednesday. Millions of people now are under evacuation orders, some mandatory. And forecasters warn that the storm could bring life-threatening storm surges as well as flash flooding.</p><p>Meteorologist Chad Myers joins me now from the CNN World Weather Center. And Chad, you are closely tracking this major storm as it moves into the U.S. Gulf Coast. What are you seeing?</p><p>CHAD NYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: The United States actually takes airplanes, C-130 airplanes that they specially modify and fly them into these things. They fly them right through the eye to see how strong the wind is. And they just found 100 miles per hour or 160 kilometers per hour in the eye wall itself. And it is forecast to go all the way to 200 kilometers per hour.</p><p>Now, that may not be a Haiyan or something in the west pacific, but this is a big storm that will affect the Gulf of Mexico and get stronger. A very populated area here from Panama City westward. Not so much eastward. As we get toward the Apalachicola area. That's where things begin to take her off. There's not as much land here.</p><p>It's more mangrove, more swampy area here but a very populated tourist section of the United States right here near Panama City Beach. That will come onshore tomorrow afternoon, noon to 1:30 local time, somewhere there as a Category 3, a 200 kilometer per hour hurricane. There it is right there. That's what it's going to look like.</p><p>This is all the way through midnight tonight, local time. Not single model in the world has this dying off. Every model has it going up from here. So the hurricane warnings are posted here. If you are in this red zone, you are going to get a hurricane force wind and probably some power outages because the winds are going to start to knock those trees down and power lines down.</p><p>The winds arrive tonight. The winds very much get into hurricane forecast strength somewhere around 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. And then all the way through parts of Georgia and northern Florida, that's where the power lines are going to fall down. This is the widespread power outage forecast from Panama City right on back all the way over here.</p><p>This is Apalachicola, Tallahassee, big capital city here, lots of trees pulling down to even as far north possibly as Macon, Georgia. Here are the wind gusts and if you see the white, you follow it over here, every one, not just a pinpoint, but everyone here from 50 miles up 80 kilometers, one way or the other, Panama City will see a 160 mile per hour or kilometer per hour wind gust as the storm comes onshore.</p><p>So, we are going to be having a rough couple days across the southeast. And then the storm runs right back over North Carolina where the last hurricane came down.</p><p>[08:10:003] Roads are still flooded, trees are certainly in mud. They will come down as well when you get 100 kilometer per hour wind on a tree that's already standing in mud, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Well, this storm will be life-threatening and very, very dangerous. Chad Myers, reporting live for us. Chad, thank you.</p><p>Turkey says that Saudi officials have agreed to a search of its consulate in Istanbul where a missing Saudi journalist, Jamala Khashoggi, was last seen. And now, we are getting a look at Khashoggi entering the building before he vanished one week ago. The Saudis insist that he left the consulate but his fiance says he never re-emerged.</p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson is in Istanbul outside the Saudi consulate. He joins us now live. And Nic, Turkey says that Saudi officials, they have agreed to the search on the consulate. What would that search involve?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, at the moment, Kristie, we do not know what the parameters are going to be. How many people can be involved in the search? Are they police forensics? Are they just officials from the ministry of justice? How long will they get to search? What kind of freedom of access they may get inside?</p><p>Will they have the opportunity to visit the consulate general's residence? What are the precise parameters of this investigation? What we know from the ministry of foreign affairs here is that they are using the Vienna convention's governing sort of diplomatic properties in all the countries to be allowed to have this kind of access.</p><p>But again, we don't know what it's going to lead to. And it's also important to point out, you know, of an investigation of this type, it comes a week now after Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after that video was shot of him on a security camera going into the consulate, 1:14 p.m.</p><p>His fiance waiting outside later raises the alarm. We are also hearing from President Trump on this saying that he is concerned. He says that we don't know anything. We don't have any of the details yet. Vice President Mike Pence is saying he is deeply troubled and that the world deserves answers.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is saying that the Saudis should support an investigation. So perhaps what we are seeing here, Saudi officials listening to what they are hearing from the United States, the leading world power here and a keen supporter of Saudi Arabia. But again, we don't know the limits of that investigation but the Saudis are accepting on the premises of the consulate here.</p><p>And we do know from the Turkish president that has left it on the Saudis to prove that Khashoggi left the building because, of course, that's what the Saudis say as well as saying that the reports that Khashoggi may have been killed here are outrageous and untrue, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: This is a case that will certainly affect ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. One week on, still no answers. Nic Robertson joining us live from Istanbul. Thank you.</p><p>Now, police in Bulgaria, they are questioning a Romanian man in connection with the rape and murder of a journalist Viktoria Maranova, but they say he is not a suspect. Hundreds of mourners held vigils in cities across the country demanding justice for Maranova. Prosecutors say that she had been raped, beaten and suffocated. Her body was found on Saturday. The European Union is urging Bulgaria to waste no time trying to find whoever killed her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARITIS SCHINAS, CHIEF SPOKESPERSON, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: The Commission expects a swift and thorough investigation by the responsible authorities that will bring those responsible to justice and clarify whether this attack was linked to her work. We must make sure that journalists everywhere are safe and make their invaluable contributions to our Democratic societies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Just over a week ago, Maranova had journalists on her TV show who were investigating alleged corruption involving E.U. funds. She said she would do similar investigations. However this one police say, it is not clear whether her death was connected to her work.</p><p>Hong Kong's leaders is refusing to explain why a prominent \"Financial Times\" journalist has been denied a visa. Chief executive Carrie Lam made the comments in speech on Tuesday and is facing mounting pressure to justify this apparent challenge to press freedom. Victor Mallet, the FT's Asian news editor and a British national angered authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong (inaudible) by hosting a speech by the leader of a tiny pro independent political party in August.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: I cannot tell you exactly what journalist should say or act or interview. But I can assure you as I did intense (ph) news, freedom of expression, freedom of reporting are core values in Hong Kong.</p><p>[08:15:01] And as a chief executive, I and the Hong Kong (inaudible) government will safeguard all these rights as enshrined in the basic law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: On Sunday, Mallet was given seven days to leave Hong Kong.</p><p>The wife of the former chief of Interpol tells CNN that China is detaining her husband because of, quote, \"political persecution.\" Meng Hongwei vanished after he took a flight from France to Beijing. CNN'S Sam Kiley is here in Hong Kong. He has been reporting on this story extensively for us. He joins us now, and Sam, Meng's wife says that he is a victim of political persecution. Could you tell us more about Meng Hongwei and what would make him a target in China?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he comes from very much the inner elite of the nation, not only that, but he is securocrat of the almost the highest level securocrat. He's vice minister, at least was until he was arrested and accused or investigated for alleged corruption.</p><p>The vice minister for public security, not only that of course, but he was the president of Interpol, elected in 2016 as the head man of the world's liaison system between national police organizations. So in that context, he would have been -- one would have hoped he would have been assumed to be beyond reproach. But according to the Chinese government, he is now under investigation for corruption and a number of other issues.</p><p>His wife though unusually I think here has gone on to the front foot rather than retreat and hope that he would be leniently treated. She is now -- said to CNN, in a brief text exchange, that his arrest is a result of political persecution. She has also said over the last 24 hours that she will continue to speak out to, quote, \"protect other husbands and fathers from being disappeared\" as she put it, in China.</p><p>So, this is becoming a very heated topic. Undermining China's efforts internationally to establish extradition treaties, but it is consistent with China's efforts, and they have been going on for some years as you know, to round up officials that have been accused of corruption and indeed prosecute them. And in the case of some more junior officials, actually execute them.</p><p>LU STOUT: Sam Kiley with the latest on the situation involving Meng Hongwei and his wife speaking out as well. Thank you very much for your reporting Sam.</p><p>Now, the U.S. and China, they could soon pay the price for their ever escalating trade war. The world's two largest economies have been targeting each other's products with tariffs on goods totalling some hundreds of billions of dollars. One consequence, the IMF is cutting the growth forecast for both countries next year.</p><p>Now, for the United States, that means slipping from 2.5 percent next year down from nearly 2.9 percent this year. It predicts a similar slowdown for China to 2.2, rather 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent. And it warns that growth could be hit further if the two countries don't settle their disputes.</p><p>We are going to have much more on this on this gloomy outlook amid the trade war, that's coming up on \"First Move with Julia Chatterley\" and that starts in less than an hour from now. You are watching \"News Stream.\"</p><p>And still ahead, a British website is claiming to know the true identity of one of two suspects wanted in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter.</p><p>Plus, Google is in damage control mode after news of a major security breach.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT\": Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\"</p><p>Now, a British investigative website is claiming to have uncovered the true identity of Russian agent wanted in connection with the Novichok poisonings in Salisbury, England earlier this year. Now the website is called Bellingcat, it says the man on the left of your screen named by British police as Alexander Petrov is in fact Alexander Mischkin.</p><p>The Russian embassy in London now says it is ready to discuss what it's calling the speculations through official channels with British authorities. Now CNN's Nina Dos Santos has been covering this story, joins us from London outside the Houses of Parliament. And Nina, tell us more about, you know, how Bellingcat was able to uncover the identity of this second suspect.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bellingcat does have four members (ph) you will remember a few weeks ago managed to uncover the identity of the first GRU officer as part of that batch of suspects who were involved allegedly according to U.K. in the Salisbury poisonings. And they have used similar techniques on this individual. Though they said that his digital footprint as far scarcer (ph) so it took quite a bit more time.</p><p>He also comes from originally a more remote part of Russia and his name is Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin. They believe 39-years-old and he is a doctor which is quite interesting because obviously, these two individuals were allegedly handling a very toxic substance.</p><p>The idea there being that having a doctor on hand could be important in terms of administering the right dose of poison and also dealing with the consequences potentially if one of the two officers were to have contaminated themselves, Kristie.</p><p>They say that they (inaudible) through open source databases. They found an individual as like a similar (inaudible) and a similar date of birth of those particular individuals who have studied at a naval academy in the medical unit there.</p><p>And they essentially have just given a press conference in parliament behind me where they have given more information about how they uncovered all of this. They said they blanket e-mailed people who were potentially classmates in the year above and the year below. They also sent a reporter very recently to the village of this individual and that's when they manage to get conclusive -- what they believe was conclusive photographic evidence that this is indeed the same person.</p><p>They managed to get hold of a passport issued in 2001 with what is said to be his real name and used facial recognition software to try and cross check the features in the passport that came out, on of course, travelling under the alias, Alexander Petrov. He was intercepted as having coming to the U.K. earlier on this year, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Nina Dos Santos, reporting live for us in London. Thank you.</p><p>Google's unpopular social network is finally finding itself in the spotlight but for all the wrong reasons. Google says it is shutting down Google+ for consumers after a \"Wall Street Journal\" report revealed the firm chose not to publically disclose a security flaw when it was discovered in the spring.</p><p>In a blog post seemingly in response to the Journal's report, Google said this, quote, \"that it discovered and immediately patched a software glitch in March of 2018, that had given outside developers access to users' private profile data. The bug reportedly exposed some 500,000 user accounts.\" Google says it found no evidence of any data misuse.</p><p>Now, we are joined now by David edleman. He previously advised former U.S. President Barack Obama on technology and economic policy and now leads MIT's research on technology governance, and joins us live from D.C. David, thank you so much for joining us here on the program.</p><p>DAVID EDELMAN, DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON TECHNOLOGY, THE ECONOMY, &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY: Thanks Kristie for having me.</p><p>LU STOUT: Google is shutting down Google+. Let's face it, this was a social platform that wasn't that working. It was on the wane. Let's talk about the real headline here that reports out there Google knew about this security flaw and covered it up. Is that going to be a big problem for Google?</p><p>[08:24:59] EDELMAN: Well, it's another day, another potential data leak here in the U.S. Last week it was Facebook with 50 million potential exposed users, and this time it's Google with a half a million. Certainly, the news here is not great for Google. You may remember that this news was first uncovered, we understand from the memo, back in March.</p><p>The same time that Facebook, the giant social network, was being called here to Washington to have their executives grilled in front of Congress to figure out exactly what happened in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And it was apparently according to internal memos, that reason, Google's desire to stay out of the spotlight. That was the reason they didn't come out with this immediately.</p><p>Now, Google took a pretty unusual step here of actually killing the entire service that was responsible for this potential data leak. They also announced some new limitations on how third parties can get access to data.</p><p>But there's no question that this time of real regulatory scrutiny of Silicon Valley companies particularly social media firms, this is not going to play well for Google which until now has more or less managed to skirt a lot of the attention that has been paid to Facebook and others in this debate.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. And one about that the security flaw, Google is launching some hardware. It's not know for that but it is introducing some new gadgets today including new Pixel phones, also Google home devices. We know privacy has been an issue on Google's virtual platform. Is it safe to say it's going to be an issue to with their hardware?</p><p>EDELMAN: Well, I think it's fair to say that anytime you have an always on device in your house, we have to be concerned about the privacy of it. That's not unique to Google. It's true of Amazon as well and even Facebook just announced it is going to have their own device, sort of the masters by ironic timing, a video device in houses that can potentially track user's faces.</p><p>Now look, all of these companies are trying to reassure users, talking about how the data streams are encrypted, about how they won't use that information for marketing. What we're seeing time and again is that what companies say in some instances today may not hold tomorrow or next year, particularly really when that data can be valuable.</p><p>That's supposedly the reason why the Instagram co-founders just quit Facebook, their new parent company because of changes in how this data is being used. And so, well on the one hand, there's a major commercial incentive for companies to get this right. Amazon, Google, they don't want to see users feeling spied on because they will lose their traction.</p><p>At the same time, the timing is not fantastic to be announcing any new device that's going to be listening to individuals, particularly when nine out of 10 Americans at least feel like they have lost control out of their data one way or another.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, and yet Google is going to be making a Google Home announcement today. Facebook just launched Portal, this A.I. powered camera that's supposed to follow us in our homes. You know, as big tech pushes deeper into our living rooms, is the industry applying the lessons learned from all these big data breaches and all those hearings in Washington, D.C. or is it still a case of let's move fast, let's break things at the expense of consumer security?</p><p>EDELMAN: Well, it's probably a little bit of both. In the one hand, I don't think you would have seen the same attention being paid to security for instance this latest Facebook hardware announcement or what Google was doing in shutting down Google+ and limiting the access to some other areas of Google information for third parties.</p><p>That is clearly in a response to the potential waning of user trust that you are seeing. Facebook, Google, the others are trying to shut down others access to the data and ultimately create an island of themselves. And so ultimately, the trust relationship with users is just with that company.</p><p>The down side, it's going to invite a lot more regulatory scrutiny particularly by competition regulators that are going to be in a position to say, look, now these companies are not just in a broader ecosystem but are on their own.</p><p>An as they are on their own, more and more you are going to see issues like these, incidents like these which will not be the last, these sort of data leaks, creating more and more attention and more and more scrutiny for individual companies. I do think we have seen a bit of a turning point here in Washington and indeed around the world.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. Well, a turning point but yet, we can still anticipate more data breaches to come and us reporting and discussing right here in CNN. David I have to leave it at that, but thank you so much for joining us. David Edelman of MIT., take care.</p><p>Now, a controversial digital security law has been approved in Bangladesh and journalists and human rights groups, they are not happy about it. It combines the colonial era law, the official Secrets Act with new measures that Amnesty International says impose dangerous restrictions on freedom of expression.</p><p>Here's why. Now, police can now make arrests without a warrant. Offenders can be sentenced up to three years for publishing information that is aggressive or frightening and up to 10 years for posting information that ruins communal harmony. Critic calls this the darkest period in Bangladesh's democracy.</p><p>But a government official says the law is necessary to, quote, \"safeguard the digital space and democracy.\" You are watching \"News Stream.\" Still to come, Brett Kavanaugh is back on the bench this time as a Supreme Court justice. We will head to Washington for a preview of his first day on the job.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream.\" These are your world headlines.</p><p>The Turkish foreign ministry says Saudi Arabia has agreed to a search of the Istanbul consulate where a Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, was last seen a week ago. This newly released video shows him going into the consulate. The Saudis insist he left the building. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is calling on Riyadh to release any images that show Khashoggi left.</p><p>Rescuers in Southwestern China, they are still searching for a father and a son inside a massive sinkhole that opened up Sunday afternoon local time. At least two people died, a young couple who were reportedly married only days before. The cause of the cave-in is unclear.</p><p>After a bitter battle, Brett Kavanaugh will hear his first argument as a Supreme Court justice today. U.S. President Donald Trump hosted a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for Kavanaugh at the White House Monday night. Kavanaugh's confirmation ended a contentious process that saw him accused of sexual assault by multiple women.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Ariane de Vogue. She is at the Supreme Court in Washington. Ariane, thank you for joining us this day. As now Justice Kavanaugh puts on his robe for the first time today, protesters are expected to make their voices heard. Set the scene for us.</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Right, Justice Brett Kavanaugh is going to take the bench for the first time. This comes after those polarizing confirmation hearings, perhaps the most political in modern day history. He will take his seat on the far right side of the bench. That's where the junior most justice sits, just next to Elena Kagan.</p><p>They are hearing a case on federal firearms. There are so far no huge blockbuster cases on the docket, but really big issues are percolating in the courts below. They will make their way up here. Keep in mind, with Kavanaugh, this court has now taken a hard right turn.</p><p>As for the other justices, Chief Justice John Roberts will really focus on trying to repair the reputation of the court after those partisan hearings. At that ceremony last night, all the sitting justices attended not only to show their support for their new colleague but also a show of force for the court itself.</p><p>You can see behind me right now, there aren't a lot of protesters. That's in sharp contrast to what we saw Saturday, when the protesters really stormed up those steps, something that they're not allowed to do, and they started banging on those 13-ton bronze doors.</p><p>As for Brett Kavanaugh, he said that his two daughters would be at court today. He has done something that no other justice has ever done.</p><p>[08:35:00] He has hired a full compliment of four female clerks. Nobody has ever done that. He has always said that he wants to advance women. But it also comes as a push back to those allegations of sexual misconduct, those that he has so categorically denied from the beginning.</p><p>LU STOUT: Kavanaugh being flanked by female aides. Very interesting optics that we will see. With Kavanaugh on the bench, the Supreme Court, as you put it, has made this hard turn to the right. This will bring change to the court, but how will it be manifested?</p><p>DE VOGUE: Well, remember, he is taking the seat of Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote on so many of those hot button issues, abortion, LGBT rights. And now, that seat that was with the centrist has gone to a conservative. You can expect there is no longer a swing vote here. The five justices have a solid conservative majority.</p><p>LU STOUT: Ariane de Vogue reporting live from the Supreme Court there in D.C.Ariane, thank you for joining us.</p><p>DE VOGUE: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, there is already bad blood between stars Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Of course, you remember when he grabbed the mike after she won an MTV music award back in 2009. Well, now it appears that President Trump is right behind him.</p><p>He lashed out at the pop star one day after long-time Nashville resident endorsed two Tennessee Democrats on Instagram. She called on her fans to vote for Phil Bredesen over Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Marsha Blackburn is doing a very good job in Tennessee. She is leading now substantially which she should. She's a tremendous woman. I'm sure Taylor Swift has nothing or doesn't know anything about her. Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, Swift also endorsed Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper, who is running for re-election to the House. So far, Swift has not commented on the president's remarks.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still to come, we will take a look at what this neighborhood in Hong Kong has to offer. The story is coming up next on \"News Stream.\"</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, broadcasting live from Hong Kong, welcome back. You are watching \"News Stream.\"</p><p>For film producers and photographers, one bustling working class area in Hong Kong offers so more than just street market and sign boards. Its character has attracted the attention of Hollywood director Michael Bay and others. Here is a slice of the iconic Hong Kong neighborhood Sham Shui Po.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Sham Shui Po is one of Hong Kong's oldest working class neighborhoods, well-known for its array of street markets. With its iconic and somewhat rusted Hong Kong feel, this areas' old world charm is attracting creative souls from street artists to coffee artisans.</p><p>MICHAEL TAM, FOUNDER, CAFE SAUSALITO: I grew up here in Sham Shui Po. My parents used to run a garment button shop.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Michael Tam is the founder of Cafe Sausalito Hong Kong.</p><p>[08:40:00] He set up shop in 2014 on Tai Nan Street, street famous on the silver screen.</p><p>TAM: When we first opened, there were \"Transformers.\" I remember that being filmed in this neighborhood. And then afterwards, there were few others. \"Ghost in the Shell\" was also another very memorable one.</p><p>And then \"Geostorm\" featuring Gerard Butler. The main reason that film directors want to come here to Sham Shui Po for film or movies is that they get a lot of the previously -- what is recognized as Hong Kong in Sham Shui Po.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): It's not only film crews that flock to this area to indulge in its visual richness but Instagrammers as well. Tommy Fung is a photographer and photo editor of Surreal HK.</p><p>TOMMY FUNG, PHOTOGRAPHER AND PHOTO EDITOR, SURREAL HK: What I'm trying to do is make people laugh and cheer people up.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Fung was born in Hong Kong but raised in Venezuela. Upon his return, he was curious about the hometown he left behind and started to explore it through his camera lens. This building was painted in 2016 as part of the government-approved HK walls street art and mural festival.</p><p>FUNG: This is very interesting and very colorful and very eye catching, so I like it so much.</p><p>I always take a bus to my home in the street across. I always see the sign. It's very interesting and catch my attention.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Over the past decade, many of Hong Kong's sign boards have been taken down due to new government safety regulations. For Fung, these signs are a part of Hong Kong's identity.</p><p>Fung took this photo from a small garden hill. Its easy access has made it a favorite spot for filming Instagram worth (ph) sunsets.</p><p>FUNG: I think it's very relaxing and you can enjoy the view.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): From stunning city views and street art to iconic sign boards, Sham Shui Po is quintessential Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Surreal Hong Kong is a good follow on Instagram.

President Donald Trump hosted a ceremonial swearing in ceremony for  Kavanaugh at the White House on Monday night. And during the event, the  president not only praised his pick, he also took a swipe at the women who  accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault calling it all a hoax. And then he said  this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On behalf of our nation, I  want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible  pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward  to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Mr. Trump made those declarations as a new CNN poll shows that a  majority of Americans, some 52 percent say they believe Kavanaugh's  accusers. For his part, Kavanaugh says he starts his new job with, quote,  \"no bitterness and that he hopes to be a unifying force.\" One place he  could do that, well, four weeks from today, in the U.S. Midterms. </p><p>The president and his fellow Republicans hope to use Kavanaugh's bruising  confirmation battle to rally the base. Now, CNN White House correspondent  Abby Phillip joins us now live, and Abby, again, the hearing of Brett  Kavanaugh, it was not a criminal trial and yet the U.S. president has  passed judgment on Justice Kavanaugh. What did Trump say? </p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That is exactly right,  Kristie. The president, as you pointed out, first started by apologizing to  the Kavanaugh's for the process. And then he talked about a basic principle  of being innocent until proven guilty. But then he added another part,  implying that Kavanaugh had been through some kind of trial, had been  exonerated clearly in the eyes of the law, which he has not been. Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent  unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir,  under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHILLIP):  I think most people would not disagree with the first part of  that quote, but it's the second part which the president seemed to ad lib  on the end there, is what people would take issue with. There was, if you  remember, a lot of controversy about the process here in the senate, there  were only two witnesses, it was Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey  Ford. </p><p>And then there was a very abbreviated FBI investigation that many said was  limited in scope by the White House in an effort to prevent certain people  from being questioned by the FBI as part of this investigation. But the  president clearly not concerned about much of that at all and trying to  focus on what he says is just a political unfairness directed toward his  nominee. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Kavanaugh, he begins his first day at the Supreme Court. This is  a moment that Republicans have been dreaming of for decades and we are just  a month out until the midterms. So how does the GOP -- how does Donald  Trump -- how do they believe they can capitalize on Kavanaugh and the anger  generated from the hearings? </p><p>PHILLIP:  Well, this is something we're going to hear a lot about in the  next couple of weeks. The president talking about Democrats as an angry  mob, saying that they demonstrated that in the Kavanaugh process. The  president here is really speaking to his base. Republicans have been  worried that their own supporters would not come out in November, and now  President Trump is predicting something totally different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PHILLIP:  A man that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught up in a hoax  that was set up by the Democrats, using the Democrats' lawyers and now they  wan to impeach him. I have heard this from many people. I think it's an  insult to the American public and I think you are going to see a lot of  things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:05:14] PHILLIP:  And the president there implying that the prospect  that Democrats could try to impeach Justice Kavanaugh now would be enough  to get his voters to maybe wake up before November and get to the polls.  Already the Democratic enthusiasm is extremely high going into this  election. What Republicans are hoping to do is get their folks engaged and  out to the polls especially in some of the Senate races that will decide  whether Democrats or Republicans take control of that important chamber. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, a number of Americans fired up ahead of these critical  midterm elections. Abby Phillip reporting live from the White House. Abby,  thank you. </p><p>And for Hillary Clinton, President Trump's decision to honor Kavanaugh at  the White House was troubling for both the country and the court. And she  spoke about her concerns in an exclusive interview with Christiane  Amanpour. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  What was  done last night in the White House was a political rally. It further  undermined the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me  greatly. It saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one  of the main pillars of our constitutional government. </p><p>So, I don't know how people are going to react to it. I think given our  divides, it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and  those who are against. But the president has been true to form. He has  insulted, attacked, demeaned women throughout the campaign, really for many  years leading up to the campaign. And he has continued to do that inside  the White House. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Tune in later for Christiane's full interview with Hillary  Clinton. It airs 6:00 p.m. Tuesday in London, 1:00 a.m. Wednesday here in  Hong Kong, right here on CNN. </p><p>Hurricane Michael is threatening nearly 500 kilometers of the U.S. Gulf  Coast and is expected to strengthen into a dangerous major hurricane before  making landfall in Florida on Wednesday. Millions of people now are under  evacuation orders, some mandatory. And forecasters warn that the storm  could bring life-threatening storm surges as well as flash flooding. </p><p>Meteorologist Chad Myers joins me now from the CNN World Weather Center.  And Chad, you are closely tracking this major storm as it moves into the  U.S. Gulf Coast. What are you seeing?</p><p>CHAD NYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  The United States actually takes airplanes,  C-130 airplanes that they specially modify and fly them into these things.  They fly them right through the eye to see how strong the wind is. And they  just found 100 miles per hour or 160 kilometers per hour in the eye wall  itself. And it is forecast to go all the way to 200 kilometers per hour. </p><p>Now, that may not be a Haiyan or something in the west pacific, but this is  a big storm that will affect the Gulf of Mexico and get stronger. A very  populated area here from Panama City westward. Not so much eastward. As we  get toward the Apalachicola area. That's where things begin to take her  off. There's not as much land here. </p><p>It's more mangrove, more swampy area here but a very populated tourist  section of the United States right here near Panama City Beach. That will  come onshore tomorrow afternoon, noon to 1:30 local time, somewhere there  as a Category 3, a 200 kilometer per hour hurricane. There it is right  there. That's what it's going to look like. </p><p>This is all the way through midnight tonight, local time. Not single model  in the world has this dying off. Every model has it going up from here. So  the hurricane warnings are posted here. If you are in this red zone, you  are going to get a hurricane force wind and probably some power outages  because the winds are going to start to knock those trees down and power  lines down. </p><p>The winds arrive tonight. The winds very much get into hurricane forecast  strength somewhere around 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. And then all the way  through parts of Georgia and northern Florida, that's where the power lines  are going to fall down. This is the widespread power outage forecast from  Panama City right on back all the way over here. </p><p>This is Apalachicola, Tallahassee, big capital city here, lots of trees  pulling down to even as far north possibly as Macon, Georgia. Here are the  wind gusts and if you see the white, you follow it over here, every one,  not just a pinpoint, but everyone here from 50 miles up 80 kilometers, one  way or the other, Panama City will see a 160 mile per hour or kilometer per  hour wind gust as the storm comes onshore. </p><p>So, we are going to be having a rough couple days across the southeast. And  then the storm runs right back over North Carolina where the last hurricane  came down. </p><p>[08:10:003] Roads are still flooded, trees are certainly in mud. They will  come down as well when you get 100 kilometer per hour wind on a tree that's  already standing in mud, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Well, this storm will be life-threatening and very, very  dangerous. Chad Myers, reporting live for us. Chad, thank you. </p><p>Turkey says that Saudi officials have agreed to a search of its consulate  in Istanbul where a missing Saudi journalist, Jamala Khashoggi, was last  seen. And now, we are getting a look at Khashoggi entering the building  before he vanished one week ago. The Saudis insist that he left the  consulate but his fiance says he never re-emerged. </p><p>CNN's Nic Robertson is in Istanbul outside the Saudi consulate. He joins us  now live. And Nic, Turkey says that Saudi officials, they have agreed to  the search on the consulate. What would that search involve? </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yes, at the moment,  Kristie, we do not know what the parameters are going to be. How many  people can be involved in the search? Are they police forensics? Are they  just officials from the ministry of justice? How long will they get to  search? What kind of freedom of access they may get inside? </p><p>Will they have the opportunity to visit the consulate general's residence?  What are the precise parameters of this investigation? What we know from  the ministry of foreign affairs here is that they are using the Vienna  convention's governing sort of diplomatic properties in all the countries  to be allowed to have this kind of access. </p><p>But again, we don't know what it's going to lead to. And it's also  important to point out, you know, of an investigation of this type, it  comes a week now after Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after that video was  shot of him on a security camera going into the consulate, 1:14 p.m. </p><p>His fiance waiting outside later raises the alarm. We are also hearing from  President Trump on this saying that he is concerned. He says that we don't  know anything. We don't have any of the details yet. Vice President Mike  Pence is saying he is deeply troubled and that the world deserves answers. </p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is saying that the Saudis should support an  investigation. So perhaps what we are seeing here, Saudi officials  listening to what they are hearing from the United States, the leading  world power here and a keen supporter of Saudi Arabia. But again, we don't  know the limits of that investigation but the Saudis are accepting on the  premises of the consulate here. </p><p>And we do know from the Turkish president that has left it on the Saudis to  prove that Khashoggi left the building because, of course, that's what the  Saudis say as well as saying that the reports that Khashoggi may have been  killed here are outrageous and untrue, Kristie. </p><p>LU STOUT:  This is a case that will certainly affect ties between Saudi  Arabia and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. One week on, still no answers.  Nic Robertson joining us live from Istanbul. Thank you. </p><p>Now, police in Bulgaria, they are questioning a Romanian man in connection  with the rape and murder of a journalist Viktoria Maranova, but they say he  is not a suspect. Hundreds of mourners held vigils in cities across the  country demanding justice for Maranova. Prosecutors say that she had been  raped, beaten and suffocated. Her body was found on Saturday. The European  Union is urging Bulgaria to waste no time trying to find whoever killed  her. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARITIS SCHINAS, CHIEF SPOKESPERSON, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  The  Commission expects a swift and thorough investigation by the responsible  authorities that will bring those responsible to justice and clarify  whether this attack was linked to her work. We must make sure that  journalists everywhere are safe and make their invaluable contributions to  our Democratic societies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LU STOUT:  Just over a week ago, Maranova had journalists on her TV show  who were investigating alleged corruption involving E.U. funds. She said  she would do similar investigations. However this one police say, it is not  clear whether her death was connected to her work. </p><p>Hong Kong's leaders is refusing to explain why a prominent \"Financial  Times\" journalist has been denied a visa. Chief executive Carrie Lam made  the comments in speech on Tuesday and is facing mounting pressure to  justify this apparent challenge to press freedom. Victor Mallet, the FT's  Asian news editor and a British national angered authorities in Beijing and  Hong Kong (inaudible) by hosting a speech by the leader of a tiny pro  independent political party in August. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG:  I cannot tell you exactly what  journalist should say or act or interview. But I can assure you as I did  intense (ph) news, freedom of expression, freedom of reporting are core  values in Hong Kong. </p><p>[08:15:01] And as a chief executive, I and the Hong Kong (inaudible)  government will safeguard all these rights as enshrined in the basic law. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  On Sunday, Mallet was given seven days to leave Hong Kong. </p><p>The wife of the former chief of Interpol tells CNN that China is detaining  her husband because of, quote, \"political persecution.\" Meng Hongwei  vanished after he took a flight from France to Beijing. CNN'S Sam Kiley is  here in Hong Kong. He has been reporting on this story extensively for us.  He joins us now, and Sam, Meng's wife says that he is a victim of political  persecution. Could you tell us more about Meng Hongwei and what would make  him a target in China? </p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, he comes from  very much the inner elite of the nation, not only that, but he is  securocrat of the almost the highest level securocrat. He's vice minister,  at least was until he was arrested and accused or investigated for alleged  corruption. </p><p>The vice minister for public security, not only that of course, but he was  the president of Interpol, elected in 2016 as the head man of the world's  liaison system between national police organizations. So in that context,  he would have been -- one would have hoped he would have been assumed to be  beyond reproach. But according to the Chinese government, he is now under  investigation for corruption and a number of other issues. </p><p>His wife though unusually I think here has gone on to the front foot rather  than retreat and hope that he would be leniently treated. She is now --  said to CNN, in a brief text exchange, that his arrest is a result of  political persecution. She has also said over the last 24 hours that she  will continue to speak out to, quote, \"protect other husbands and fathers  from being disappeared\" as she put it, in China. </p><p>So, this is becoming a very heated topic. Undermining China's efforts  internationally to establish extradition treaties, but it is consistent  with China's efforts, and they have been going on for some years as you  know, to round up officials that have been accused of corruption and indeed  prosecute them. And in the case of some more junior officials, actually  execute them. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Sam Kiley with the latest on the situation involving Meng  Hongwei and his wife speaking out as well. Thank you very much for your  reporting Sam. </p><p>Now, the U.S. and China, they could soon pay the price for their ever  escalating trade war. The world's two largest economies have been targeting  each other's products with tariffs on goods totalling some hundreds of  billions of dollars. One consequence, the IMF is cutting the growth  forecast for both countries next year. </p><p>Now, for the United States, that means slipping from 2.5 percent next year  down from nearly 2.9 percent this year. It predicts a similar slowdown for  China to 2.2, rather 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent. And it warns that growth  could be hit further if the two countries don't settle their disputes. </p><p>We are going to have much more on this on this gloomy outlook amid the  trade war, that's coming up on \"First Move with Julia Chatterley\" and that  starts in less than an hour from now. You are watching \"News Stream.\" </p><p>And still ahead, a British website is claiming to know the true identity of  one of two suspects wanted in the poisoning of a former Russian double  agent and his daughter. </p><p>Plus, Google is in damage control mode after news of a major security  breach. </p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT\":  Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is \"News  Stream.\"</p><p>Now, a British investigative website is claiming to have uncovered the true  identity of Russian agent wanted in connection with the Novichok poisonings  in Salisbury, England earlier this year. Now the website is called  Bellingcat, it says the man on the left of your screen named by British  police as Alexander Petrov is in fact Alexander Mischkin.</p><p>The Russian embassy in London now says it is ready to discuss what it's  calling the speculations through official channels with British  authorities. Now CNN's Nina Dos Santos has been covering this story, joins  us from London outside the Houses of Parliament. And Nina, tell us more  about, you know, how Bellingcat was able to uncover the identity of this  second suspect. </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bellingcat does have four  members (ph) you will remember a few weeks ago managed to uncover the  identity of the first GRU officer as part of that batch of suspects who  were involved allegedly according to U.K. in the Salisbury poisonings. And  they have used similar techniques on this individual. Though they said that  his digital footprint as far scarcer (ph) so it took quite a bit more time. </p><p>He also comes from originally a more remote part of Russia and his name is  Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin. They believe 39-years-old and he is a  doctor which is quite interesting because obviously, these two individuals  were allegedly handling a very toxic substance. </p><p>The idea there being that having a doctor on hand could be important in  terms of administering the right dose of poison and also dealing with the  consequences potentially if one of the two officers were to have  contaminated themselves, Kristie. </p><p>They say that they (inaudible) through open source databases. They found an  individual as like a similar (inaudible) and a similar date of birth of  those particular individuals who have studied at a naval academy in the  medical unit there. </p><p>And they essentially have just given a press conference in parliament  behind me where they have given more information about how they uncovered  all of this. They said they blanket e-mailed people who were potentially  classmates in the year above and the year below. They also sent a reporter  very recently to the village of this individual and that's when they manage  to get conclusive -- what they believe was conclusive photographic evidence  that this is indeed the same person. </p><p>They managed to get hold of a passport issued in 2001 with what is said to  be his real name and used facial recognition software to try and cross  check the features in the passport that came out, on of course, travelling  under the alias, Alexander Petrov. He was intercepted as having coming to  the U.K. earlier on this year, Kristie. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Nina Dos Santos, reporting live for us in London. Thank you. </p><p>Google's unpopular social network is finally finding itself in the  spotlight but for all the wrong reasons. Google says it is shutting down  Google+ for consumers after a \"Wall Street Journal\" report revealed the  firm chose not to publically disclose a security flaw when it was  discovered in the spring. </p><p>In a blog post seemingly in response to the Journal's report, Google said  this, quote, \"that it discovered and immediately patched a software glitch  in March of 2018, that had given outside developers access to users'  private profile data. The bug reportedly exposed some 500,000 user  accounts.\" Google says it found no evidence of any data misuse. </p><p>Now, we are joined now by David edleman. He previously advised former U.S.  President Barack Obama on technology and economic policy and now leads  MIT's research on technology governance, and joins us live from D.C. David,  thank you so much for joining us here on the program. </p><p>DAVID EDELMAN, DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON TECHNOLOGY, THE ECONOMY, &amp; NATIONAL  SECURITY:  Thanks Kristie for having me. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Google is shutting down Google+. Let's face it, this was a  social platform that wasn't that working. It was on the wane. Let's talk  about the real headline here that reports out there Google knew about this  security flaw and covered it up. Is that going to be a big problem for  Google? </p><p>[08:24:59] EDELMAN:  Well, it's another day, another potential data leak  here in the U.S. Last week it was Facebook with 50 million potential  exposed users, and this time it's Google with a half a million. Certainly,  the news here is not great for Google. You may remember that this news was  first uncovered, we understand from the memo, back in March. </p><p>The same time that Facebook, the giant social network, was being called  here to Washington to have their executives grilled in front of Congress to  figure out exactly what happened in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And it  was apparently according to internal memos, that reason, Google's desire to  stay out of the spotlight. That was the reason they didn't come out with  this immediately. </p><p>Now, Google took a pretty unusual step here of actually killing the entire  service that was responsible for this potential data leak. They also  announced some new limitations on how third parties can get access to data. </p><p>But there's no question that this time of real regulatory scrutiny of  Silicon Valley companies particularly social media firms, this is not going  to play well for Google which until now has more or less managed to skirt a  lot of the attention that has been paid to Facebook and others in this  debate. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. And one about that the security flaw, Google is launching  some hardware. It's not know for that but it is introducing some new  gadgets today including new Pixel phones, also Google home devices. We know  privacy has been an issue on Google's virtual platform. Is it safe to say  it's going to be an issue to with their hardware? </p><p>EDELMAN:  Well, I think it's fair to say that anytime you have an always on  device in your house, we have to be concerned about the privacy of it.  That's not unique to Google. It's true of Amazon as well and even Facebook  just announced it is going to have their own device, sort of the masters by  ironic timing, a video device in houses that can potentially track user's  faces.</p><p>Now look, all of these companies are trying to reassure users, talking  about how the data streams are encrypted, about how they won't use that  information for marketing. What we're seeing time and again is that what  companies say in some instances today may not hold tomorrow or next year,  particularly really when that data can be valuable. </p><p>That's supposedly the reason why the Instagram co-founders just quit  Facebook, their new parent company because of changes in how this data is  being used. And so, well on the one hand, there's a major commercial  incentive for companies to get this right. Amazon, Google, they don't want  to see users feeling spied on because they will lose their traction. </p><p>At the same time, the timing is not fantastic to be announcing any new  device that's going to be listening to individuals, particularly when nine  out of 10 Americans at least feel like they have lost control out of their  data one way or another. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and yet Google is going to be making a Google Home  announcement today. Facebook just launched Portal, this A.I. powered camera  that's supposed to follow us in our homes. You know, as big tech pushes  deeper into our living rooms, is the industry applying the lessons learned  from all these big data breaches and all those hearings in Washington, D.C.  or is it still a case of let's move fast, let's break things at the expense  of consumer security? </p><p>EDELMAN:  Well, it's probably a little bit of both. In the one hand, I  don't think you would have seen the same attention being paid to security  for instance this latest Facebook hardware announcement or what Google was  doing in shutting down Google+ and limiting the access to some other areas  of Google information for third parties. </p><p>That is clearly in a response to the potential waning of user trust that  you are seeing. Facebook, Google, the others are trying to shut down others  access to the data and ultimately create an island of themselves. And so  ultimately, the trust relationship with users is just with that company. </p><p>The down side, it's going to invite a lot more regulatory scrutiny  particularly by competition regulators that are going to be in a position  to say, look, now these companies are not just in a broader ecosystem but  are on their own. </p><p>An as they are on their own, more and more you are going to see issues like  these, incidents like these which will not be the last, these sort of data  leaks, creating more and more attention and more and more scrutiny for  individual companies. I do think we have seen a bit of a turning point here  in Washington and indeed around the world. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. Well, a turning point but yet, we can still anticipate more  data breaches to come and us reporting and discussing right here in CNN.  David I have to leave it at that, but thank you so much for joining us.  David Edelman of MIT., take care. </p><p>Now, a controversial digital security law has been approved in Bangladesh  and journalists and human rights groups, they are not happy about it. It  combines the colonial era law, the official Secrets Act with new measures  that Amnesty International says impose dangerous restrictions on freedom of  expression. </p><p>Here's why. Now, police can now make arrests without a warrant. Offenders  can be sentenced up to three years for publishing information that is  aggressive or frightening and up to 10 years for posting information that  ruins communal harmony. Critic calls this the darkest period in  Bangladesh's democracy. </p><p>But a government official says the law is necessary to, quote, \"safeguard  the digital space and democracy.\"  You are watching \"News Stream.\" Still to  come, Brett Kavanaugh is back on the bench this time as a Supreme Court  justice. We will head to Washington for a preview of his first day on the  job. </p><p>[08:30:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong  Kong.

This newly released video shows him going into the  consulate. The Saudis insist he left the building. Turkish President Recep  Tayyip Erdogan is calling on Riyadh to release any images that show  Khashoggi left.</p><p>Rescuers in Southwestern China, they are still searching for a father and a  son inside a massive sinkhole that opened up Sunday afternoon local time.  At least two people died, a young couple who were reportedly married only  days before. The cause of the cave-in is unclear.</p><p>After a bitter battle, Brett Kavanaugh will hear his first argument as a  Supreme Court justice today. U.S. President Donald Trump hosted a  ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for Kavanaugh at the White House Monday  night. Kavanaugh's confirmation ended a contentious process that saw him  accused of sexual assault by multiple women.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Ariane de Vogue. She is at the Supreme Court in  Washington. Ariane, thank you for joining us this day. As now Justice  Kavanaugh puts on his robe for the first time today, protesters are  expected to make their voices heard. Set the scene for us.</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER:  Right, Justice Brett  Kavanaugh is going to take the bench for the first time. This comes after  those polarizing confirmation hearings, perhaps the most political in  modern day history. He will take his seat on the far right side of the  bench. That's where the junior most justice sits, just next to Elena Kagan.</p><p>They are hearing a case on federal firearms. There are so far no huge  blockbuster cases on the docket, but really big issues are percolating in  the courts below. They will make their way up here. Keep in mind, with  Kavanaugh, this court has now taken a hard right turn.</p><p>As for the other justices, Chief Justice John Roberts will really focus on  trying to repair the reputation of the court after those partisan hearings.  At that ceremony last night, all the sitting justices attended not only to  show their support for their new colleague but also a show of force for the  court itself.</p><p>You can see behind me right now, there aren't a lot of protesters. That's  in sharp contrast to what we saw Saturday, when the protesters really  stormed up those steps, something that they're not allowed to do, and they  started banging on those 13-ton bronze doors.</p><p>As for Brett Kavanaugh, he said that his two daughters would be at court  today. He has done something that no other justice has ever done.</p><p>[08:35:00]  He has hired a full compliment of four female clerks. Nobody  has ever done that. He has always said that he wants to advance women. But  it also comes as a push back to those allegations of sexual misconduct,  those that he has so categorically denied from the beginning.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Kavanaugh being flanked by female aides. Very interesting optics  that we will see. With Kavanaugh on the bench, the Supreme Court, as you  put it, has made this hard turn to the right. This will bring change to the  court, but how will it be manifested?</p><p>DE VOGUE:  Well, remember, he is taking the seat of Justice Anthony  Kennedy, and Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote on so many of those  hot button issues, abortion, LGBT rights. And now, that seat that was with  the centrist has gone to a conservative. You can expect there is no longer  a swing vote here. The five justices have a solid conservative majority.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Ariane de Vogue reporting live from the Supreme Court there in  D.C.Ariane, thank you for joining us.</p><p>DE VOGUE:  Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, there is already bad blood between stars Kanye West and  Taylor Swift. Of course, you remember when he grabbed the mike after she  won an MTV music award back in 2009. Well, now it appears that President  Trump is right behind him.</p><p>He lashed out at the pop star one day after long-time Nashville resident  endorsed two Tennessee Democrats on Instagram. She called on her fans to  vote for Phil Bredesen over Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Marsha Blackburn  is doing a very good job in Tennessee. She is leading now substantially  which she should. She's a tremendous woman. I'm sure Taylor Swift has  nothing or doesn't know anything about her. Let's say that I like Taylor's  music about 25 percent less now, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, Swift also endorsed Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper, who  is running for re-election to the House. So far, Swift has not commented on  the president's remarks.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still to come, we will take a look at what  this neighborhood in Hong Kong has to offer.

And then afterwards, there were few  others. \"Ghost in the Shell\" was also another very memorable one.</p><p>And then \"Geostorm\" featuring Gerard Butler. The main reason that film  directors want to come here to Sham Shui Po for film or movies is that they  get a lot of the previously -- what is recognized as Hong Kong in Sham Shui  Po.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  It's not only film crews that flock to this area to  indulge in its visual richness but Instagrammers as well. Tommy Fung is a  photographer and photo editor of Surreal HK.</p><p>TOMMY FUNG, PHOTOGRAPHER AND PHOTO EDITOR, SURREAL HK:  What I'm trying to  do is make people laugh and cheer people up.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Fung was born in Hong Kong but raised in Venezuela.  Upon his return, he was curious about the hometown he left behind and  started to explore it through his camera lens. This building was painted in  2016 as part of the government-approved HK walls street art and mural  festival.</p><p>FUNG:  This is very interesting and very colorful and very eye catching, so  I like it so much.</p><p>I always take a bus to my home in the street across. I always see the sign.  It's very interesting and catch my attention.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Over the past decade, many of Hong Kong's sign  boards have been taken down due to new government safety regulations. For  Fung, these signs are a part of Hong Kong's identity.</p><p>Fung took this photo from a small garden hill. Its easy access has made it  a favorite spot for filming Instagram worth (ph) sunsets.</p><p>FUNG:  I think it's very relaxing and you can enjoy the view.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  From stunning city views and street art to iconic  sign boards, Sham Shui Po is quintessential Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Surreal Hong Kong is a good follow on Instagram.

En entrevista con EL UNIVERSAL, afirma que solamente un entorno legal que sea estable permitir\u00e1 completar al gobierno la inversi\u00f3n que requiere el pa\u00eds, de lo contrario no se atender\u00e1n todas las necesidades que tiene M\u00e9xico. \"Tener un entorno legal regulatorio estable, predecible, que le d\u00e9 confianza a los inversionistas y que permita que M\u00e9xico complemente con ahorro externo y privado los d\u00e9ficits que tiene en t\u00e9rminos de ahorro interno y que no alcanzar\u00eda para financiar todas las necesidades que tenemos de inversi\u00f3n\", expone el funcionario al responder sobre el principal reto econ\u00f3mico que enfrentar\u00e1 el pa\u00eds en 2020. Afirma que a la certidumbre para los inversionistas se suman otros dos desaf\u00edos, cuyo control no corresponde al gobierno y que son la relaci\u00f3n comercial entre China y Estados Unidos y la aprobaci\u00f3n del T-MEC.  ---XXX---  J\u00f3venes piden servicios financieros estilo Big Tech CIUDAD DE M\u00c9XICO, enero 8 .- La mala experiencia de los servicios que ofrece la banca tradicional en M\u00e9xico, tanto en canales f\u00edsicos como digitales, no convence a los usuarios, principalmente a los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, quienes buscan un servicio similar a los de gigantes globales como Amazon o Google. </p><p>De acuerdo con Rafael Roncancio, director de Industria y Servicios Financieros en Capgemini de M\u00e9xico, si bien la banca ha invertido y tratado de mejorar sus servicios, no se eval\u00faa como experiencia positiva por parte de sus usuarios, pues el grado de satisfacci\u00f3n es de 33%. \"El par\u00e1metro que tienen los consumidores es el de las grandes empresas de tecnolog\u00eda (Big Tech) respecto a c\u00f3mo usar e interactuar con los servicios financieros, de manera f\u00e1cil y orientada\". Explic\u00f3 que los desarrollos de empresas financieras tecnol\u00f3gicas que han introducido al mercado productos novedosos y la plataforma Cobro Digital (CoDi), muestran alternativas para mejorar la experiencia de los usuarios.  ---XXX---  \"Este a\u00f1o seguir\u00e1 descontento social en AL\", opina Moody's CIUDAD DE M\u00c9XICO, enero 8 .- Moody's Investors Service prev\u00e9 que en 2020 siga aumentando el descontento social en Am\u00e9rica Latina, ante el bajo crecimiento de los pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n, lo cual ha impactado en creaci\u00f3n de empleos y mejora del ingreso en la regi\u00f3n. \"El aumento del descontento social a lo largo de la regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina afect\u00f3 las perspectivas de inversi\u00f3n y contribuy\u00f3 a los recortes de crecimiento observados el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o. Moody's espera que esta situaci\u00f3n contin\u00fae siendo un punto clave para 2020 y en adelante, debido a que no se espera que el crecimiento relativamente bajo mejore significativamente las din\u00e1micas del empleo, o que disminuya la desigualdad del ingreso\", indic\u00f3 la firma. En su opini\u00f3n, este a\u00f1o en Am\u00e9rica Latina el descontento social limitar\u00e1 la capacidad de los gobiernos de fijar medidas para una consolidaci\u00f3n fiscal sustancial. \"Un aumento en el descontento social puede traducirse en un mayor riesgo pol\u00edtico, que a su vez puede afectar los perfiles de cr\u00e9dito soberano.

She also told BR that the European Commission's opinion on the changes made to theCriminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Codewill be issued soon, and that specific recommendations will be made in the 2018 CVM report, which will be published later this month. 'We advised Romania on what would be the desired way out of the Justice crisis and we still have to publish the CVM report, which contains a very complete recommendation on how to keep a high quality of the judicial and prosecution system, and I am looking forward to further dialogue with Romanian representatives.I am going to Romania in 10 days, where I will speak to the Justice minister and also to other key ministers, because I am responsible for other things as well. </p><p>Also, the CVM report on Romania will be published this month. I've had many discussions with Tudorel Toader. We are in contact very frequently. In a few days, we will also issue an opinion on the last changes in the Civil and the Penal Code laws. We've already seen the Venice Commission's statement on the matter. I do believe that Romania will manage the EU Council presidency in 2019, as well as its domestic crisis. I am always optimistic and I love Romania', the EU official told Business Review. The commissioner reiterated that independent judges are an essential pillar of the country's democratic development. She also explained that her messages have been misinterpreted by the Government's officials. 'I had strong messages for Romania, but I've sent such messages for all member states. An independent judiciary is the basic pillar of democratic development of any country. Independent judges are a strength for every country. My messages towards Romania were unfortunately interpreted as pessimistic. They were not meant like that. My message was that managingthe EU presidency along with these domestic issues would be a very hard job - that's what I said', Jourova stated. Vera Jourova held a speech at the Web Summit on how Social Media and tech development are affecting democracy. 'As a European legislator I can tell you that we want elections to be free and guarantee free choice, and this is why we are advising member states to apply the rules for online content, but of course there isn't that much we can do about manipulative content because we would shift to censorship, and this is something we do not want to have in Europe,' she explained. She also reminded the audience about the fact that the European Commission adopted a strict law on protecting the privacy of citizens: the GDPR. 'I want to underline that there is a protective regulation known as GDPR. We have the strictest rules in the world protecting people's privacy. These principles have to be obeyed in political campaigns run by member states. People's data will not be abused,' she stated. She also shared her reaction on the Cambridge Analytica scandal: 'I lived half of my life in a totalitarian regime, as I am from the Czech Republic. Fortunately, there was a revolution in 1989. But what happened in this Cambridge Analytica case was something that I had experienced that before: we are just objects, we don't have free choice on the data that was stolen and messages were targeted. It's like a science fiction movie. I don't want to compare the Digital industry with a totalitarian regime, of course it's a totally different story, but the result is that people's free choicein elections will be limited. And this is something we have to fight against. This is why we are alerting everybody responsible to comply with GDPR rules, as it's the only way to ensure the people that they will remain subjects and not become objects that are easy to manipulate,' said the EU commissioner. In her opinion, tech companies and social media platforms should take more responsibility with the power they have gained. 'Every time I meet the managers of high tech companies I ask them how they will fix and prepare the world that they have broken. And they know I am partly joking, but we seriously need to renew the balance of power and responsibility. When I speak to managers of Facebook or other platforms, I ask them to what extent they find themselves responsible for the content which they provide and produce. I think big tech companies are aware that they have too much power, and that power is not balanced by responsibility. I was in Silicon Valley last year and some managers said that their companies were just pipelines, and that they don't control the content,' she explained. Vera Jourova also recalled the recommendations the EU has for social media platforms. 'I still believe that democracy occurs when people speak freely to other people. We are trying to apply one principle: to push the digital industry to apply existing laws, criminal laws. We want them to delete terrorist messages. It's absolutely legitimate. We want them to delete hate speech, child pornography. These are the principles we apply in the EU, except Germany, which already had strict laws on this matter. This is about the illegal content. But speaking about disinformation, that is lying, and lying is not illegal. This is why we are supporting the movements of facts checkers and so on', the EU official explained. 'In order for Social Media to help democracy instead of kill it, we have to join forces and bring more responsibility to all stakeholders,' she concluded. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ACTM1342191541581625956251762100150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACTM-134219</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNR-HF41-F03R-N45M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ACTmedia News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009J0N</classCode><className>CRIMINAL LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Criminal Law &amp;

According to a 2020 Financial Services Research Report released yesterday by content services firm Nuxeo, 59% regard the aftermath of Brexit as the biggest challenge the sector faces in 2020, while 21% consider it to be Big Tech competitor firms. The report, conducted independently by research company Censuswide, covered 501 respondents working in UK banking and finance between 27 September and 2 October 2019. Cybersecurity threats and data breaches, physical branches closing down, the burden of increasing regulation, competition from new challenger banks and failure to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) effectively, were among the other major challenges for 2020 identified in the report. </p><p>Overall, 60% of respondents believed that their financial organisation will be at risk of losing customers over the next year. For example, Big Tech companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple, are increasingly adopting technology and taking advantage Open Banking, threatening customer loyalty to traditional banks. With a high percentage of UK financial services specialists considering the aftermath of Brexit to be the biggest threat, banks and other financial services firms should address this with their employees.  The report suggested that firms should also take more active steps to adopt AI in their organisations, with 58% of respondents alleging that their employers lack the latest AI talent and expertise. As the industry continues to be disrupted from all sides, established financial organisations need to harness the qualities that make their propositions superior, said Mike Bagguley, former COO of Barclays International, in a statement. He added: My advice to the financial services industry in 2020 is to not let legacy complexity, residual compliance challenges, or whatever happens next with Brexit, be an excuse not to innovate. Other updates in the financial sector include the  relating to information communication technology and security risk management, effective since 30 September 2019. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDTPT-162209974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDTPT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRF-72W1-JDJN-634J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411387</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point.

Authored by Tom Luongo via Gold, Goats, 'n Guns blog,[3]  In the same week Prime Minister Boris Johnson blew up trade deal talks with the European Unionhe signs a big trade deal with Japan.[4]  In the same week Boris Johnson unveils new, very unpopular social distancing rules barring gatherings of more than six people, he puts the screws to the Scottish Nationalists who still think their support comes from their being arch-Remainers and not the contrary nature of most Scots.  In the same week that Boris Johnson sets an October 15th drop dead date for Brexit talks with the EU, President Donald Trump's election chances rose to even for the first time this summer.  In the same week Julian Assange goes through a sham trial for the sake of protecting the indefensible actions of U.S. and UK intelligence agentsJohnson's government is mulling scrapping the BBC's mandatory licence fee[5]handing them taxpayer money to undermine world security as the tip of the Marxist spear.  Now given all of that, it's clear that Boris Johnson as Prime Minister is a decidedly mixed bag. </p><p>His response to the Coronapocalypse has been an unmitigated disaster, bowing to political winds he should have never exposed himself to.  In doing so he's squandered the significant goodwill his Brexit maneuvers of 2019 garnered him and the Conservative party. So, it's obvious by now that his lack of managerial/organizational skill is what is undermining his government.  At the same time, however, Johnson's handling of Brexit has been nothing short of excellent, the valid criticisms of the Withdrawal Act by Nigel Farage notwithstanding.  Johnson inherited a poison pill from Theresa May and in his zeal to fulfill a political promise agreed to a treaty with the EU that would bring his hardball negotiating stance to the current crossroads because of his compromises on the issue of Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier in the week so much of the Withdrawal Act is predicated on there being a Free Trade Agreement between the U.K. and the EU on New Year's Eve.  That looks unlikely and the introduction of the Internal Markets bill to parliament this week is meant to do far more than what Johnson is selling publicly \u2014 to clarify the parameters of the EU's control over Northern Ireland with respect to British law and Parliament's sovereignty.  And despite the histrionics from Europe and the Remainer crowd in London, it is the EU who are in breach of the Withdrawal Act by in no way measuring up to the standard of negotiating that Free Trade Agreement in good faith.  Michel Barnier's demand are wholly inappropriate and contravene Parliament's sovereignty if not the Withdrawal Act itself. For some context as to the legal arguments this is, referhere.[6]  In short, Barnier hasn't even offered a version of the deal Former European Council President Donald Tusk offered Theresa May in 2018, demonstrating a distinct lack of good faith.  Maybe it was always Johnson's plan to push Barnier to finally reveal the extent to which he would go to demonstrate this bad faith. Then he puts the EU in the position to accept the effective changes to the Withdrawal Act as clarified by the Internal Markets bill or end talks completely.  This would then give Johnson and the Brits the right to terminate the Withdrawal Act as an international treaty, which cannot, as I understand it, supersede Parliament's sovereignty unless Parliament agrees to it. This is what Section 38 of the Withdrawal Act clearly states.  And to remind both Mr. Barnier and anyone still reading who gives a good god damn, the EU signed on to.  No one in their right mind believes international law trumps national law. Only globalists like Barnier, Von der Leyen and the rest of the EU oligarchs who think they can sign papers and make them reality.  So, maybe we are on the cusp of something truly earth-shattering when it comes to Brexit after four years. Maybe this tortuous path that Boris Johnson has taken to get to this point was all part of the plan to clean up some of the swamp surrounding 10 Downing Street, doing what Donald Trump does on the other side of the pond.  Win by not budging on the important issues and forcing your opposition to expose themselves to the public the depths of their depravity and (in the case of both the Democrats and the Eurocrats) their incompetence.  I've been saying that the USDX has been giving us a very false signal as to what's been happening in international markets for months. Solid demand for U.S. Treasury auctions belied strength in the pound, the euro and the yen.  Last week the British pound was pressing against $1.35 versus the dollar, forming a triple-top in the $1.35 area on the monthly chart.    But since last week when the odds of a No-Deal Brexit rose sharply as talks broke down and the dollar began firming, the pound has fallen sharply.  After August's robust move to the highest monthly close in the pound versus the dollar in over two years, the price action this week took the pound back below $1.28 which would be aone-bar bearish reversalif it holds through the end of September.  Is this all about Brexit, though? Or is this just as much about Johnson's insanely totalitarian move to ban all public gatherings over six people. Sure, the protests in London are just as much a political operation as the ones in the U.S. are against Donald Trump.  Yes, Brexit and Trump's re-election are the twin pillars standing tall againstThe Davos Crowd'sGreat Reset through the planned destruction of both economies through unnecessary and draconian lock downs. But,as Martin Armstrong points out[7], it may be just as much about the reality of keeping a damper on social unrest lashing out at those in power regardless of who it actually is.  Johnson's mistake was caving to the political lynch mob during the worst of the COVID-19 scare. He should have stuck by his 'herd immunity' guns. Now he's paying a stiff political price that only the hardest of hard negotiating stances over Brexit can mitigate.  Moreover, I do think this path to a No-Deal may have been the way his staff thought they could suppress the independence movements in Scotland and the eventual cleaving off of Northern Ireland by the EU. By scrapping the Irish border protocol he's telling the EU that if a hard border happens it will be you that pus it up, not us.  This, to me, has been his trump card all along. Make the EU the bad guys in the fight for the Irish border. Put Dublin on the hook for its implementation not Westminster.  Scottish Nationals don't like this path because it also puts them on notice that they can't just adopt EU rules and force another balkanization of the U.K. through Barnier's 'regulatory alignment' schemes.  And the SNP may just find that they are only popular because of their stance on an independence referendum, not because Scots are desperately simping to be a part of the EU.  In any case, a falling pound versus the dollar and a free trade deal with the Japanese are real boons to Johnson and his government today. Trump's rising re-election odds are as well as signing a free trade deal with the U.K. will be his first act in any second term, even if the U.S. has dragged its feet at the negotiating table.  Brussels knows this. The Democrats, through Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have already said they would never give the Brits a deal if they break the Good Friday Agreement.  But it won't be the Brits that do it if Johnson takes the U.K. out on No-Deal in December. It will be the EU. And that's the basis now for any kind of movement in talks.  This is why the ghost of Nigel Farage is lurking bringing up the specter of Article 24 of the GATT Treaty which can keep tariff-free trade going in 2021 between the U.K. and EU if Johnson scraps the Withdrawal Act completely.  If the EU aren't interested in that then they better hope Trump loses in 56 days. For now, expect the pound to fall, the FTSE to get a small boost and the euro rally to fade as the dollar firms on Trump's rising re-election chances.  But no matter what happens from here, the autistic screeching from the EU and Remainers about the 'U.K. breaching international law' will continue right into the courts. But treaties are just paper. They can be broken and a fracturing, impotent EU which lost its Brexit fight and its gambit to break Trump and the U.S. is a toothless one in the long run, despite their image to the contrary.  * * *  Join My Patreon[8]if you want help navigating Brexit.

In a speech at the weekend in front of the International Federation for European Law, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, shot down the notion of anything other than a so-called \u2018adequacy decision\u2019 being on the table for the UK after it exits the bloc. If granted, an adequacy decision is an EU mechanism for enabling citizens\u2019 personal data to more easily flow from the bloc to third countries \u2014 as the UK will be after Brexit. Such decisions are only granted by the European Commission after a review of a third country\u2019s privacy standards that\u2019s intended to determine that they offer essentially equivalent protections as EU rules. </p><p>But the mechanism does not allow for the third country to be involved, in any shape or form, in discussions around forming and shaping the EU\u2019s rules themselves. So, in the UK\u2019s case, the country would be going from having a seat at the rule-making table to being shut out of the process entirely \u2014 at time when the EU is really setting the global agenda on digital regulations. \u201cThe United Kingdom decided to leave our harmonised system of decision-making and enforcement. It must respect the fact that the European Union will continue to work on the basis of this system, which has allowed us to build a single market, and which allows us to deepen our single market in response to new challenges,\u201d said Barnier in Lisbon on Saturday. \u201cAnd, as indicated in the European Council guidelines, the UK must understand that the only possibility for the EU to protect personal data is through an adequacy decision. It is one thing to be inside the Union, and another to be outside.\u201d \u201cBrexit is not, and never will be, in the interest of EU businesses,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it will especially run counter to the interests of our businesses if we abandon our decision-making autonomy. This autonomy allows us to set standards for the whole of the EU, but also to see these standards being replicated around the world. This is the normative power of the Union, or what is often called \u2018the Brussels effect\u2019. \u201cAnd we cannot, and will not, share this decision-making autonomy with a third country, including a former Member State who does not want to be part of the same legal ecosystem as us.\u201d Earlier this month the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, told MPs on the UK parliament\u2019s committee for exiting the European Union that a bespoke data agreement that gave the ICO a continued role after Brexit would be a far superior option to an adequacy agreement \u2014 pointing out that the UK stands to lose influence at a time when the EU is setting global privacy standards via the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into full force last Friday. \u201cAt this time when the GDPR is in its infancy, participating in shaping and interpreting the law I think is really important. And the group of regulators that sit around the table at the EU are the most influential blocs of regulators \u2014 and if we\u2019re outside of that group and we\u2019re an observer we\u2019re not going to have the kind of effect that we need to have with big tech companies. Because that\u2019s all going to be decided by that group of regulators,\u201d she warned. \u201cThe European Data Protection Board will set the weather when it comes to standards for artificial intelligence, for technologies, for regulating big tech. So we will be a less influential regulator, we will continue to regulate the law and protect UK citizens as we do now, but we won\u2019t be at the leading edge of interpreting the GDPR \u2014 and we won\u2019t be bringing British values to that table if we\u2019re not at the table.\u201d She also pointed out that without a bespoke arrangement to accommodate the ICO her office would also be shut out of participating in the GDPR\u2019s one-stop shop, which allows EU data protection agencies to work together and co-ordinate regulatory actions, and which she said \u201cwould bring huge advantages to both sides and also to British businesses\u201d. Huge advantages that the UK stands to lose as a result of Brexit. With the ICO being excluded from participating in GDPR\u2019s one-stop shop mechanism, it also means UK businesses will have to choose an alternative data protection agency within the EU to act as their lead regulator after Brexit \u2014 putting yet another burden on startups as they will need to build new relationships with a regulator in the EU. The Irish Data Protection Commission seems the likely candidate for UK companies to look to after Brexit, when the ICO is on the side lines of GDPR, given shared language and proximity. (And Ireland\u2019s DPC has been ramping up its headcount in anticipation of handling more investigations as a result of the new regulation.) But UK businesses would clearly prefer to be able to continue working with their domestic regulator. Unfortunately, though, Brexit closes the door on that option. We\u2019ve reached out to the ICO for comment and will update this story with any response. The UK government has committed to aligning the country with GDPR regardless of Brexit \u2014 as it seeks to avoid the economic threat of EU-UK data flows being cut off if it\u2019s not judged to be providing adequate data protection. Looking ahead that also essentially means the UK will need to keep its regulatory regime aligned with the EU\u2019s in perpetuity \u2014 or risk being deemed inadequate, with, once again, the risk of data flows being cut of (or at very least businesses scrambling to put in place alternative legal arrangements to authorize their data flows, and saddled with the expense of doing so, as happened when Safe Harbor was struck down in 2015). So, thanks to Brexit, it will be the rest of Europe setting the agenda on regulating AI \u2014 with the UK bound to follow. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN852259320180530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFD-P841-DXCW-D3VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1000\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 30, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In addition the wider partnership of the UK Safer Internet Centre depends on such funding even more.</p><p>\"Not only will there be the loss of the work financed by the potential funding shortfall, but also collaborative working with EU partners stands to diminish after Brexit.</p><p>Sex, sadism, power are nothing new, they are as old as the hills and will never go away.William Chapman</p><p>\"The IWF is the largest hotline in Europe and makes the largest global contribution to the INHOPE database and so it is crucial that the UK's influence in helping shape future policy outside of the UK is not jeopardised.\"</p><p>The IICSA is conducting its second investigation phase, into how the internet is used to facilitate child sexual abuse in England and Wales through acts such as grooming, sharing indecent images and live-streaming abuse.</p><p>Leading tech firms including Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft have given evidence on how they are fighting child sexual exploitation on their platforms.</p><p>During the closing statements to this investigative phase on Friday the inquiry was warned that end-to-end encryption was likely to \"embolden paedophiles\" and make their automated detection \"near impossible\".</p><p>William Chapman, who represents three victims of online child sexual abuse, said that under self-regulation the big internet companies will only do as much as they are \"shamed into doing\".</p><p>He added. \"They are not going to self-regulate themselves out of business, there's too much money to be made.</p><p>\"They certainly will not do so if there is not a common set of rules for everyone. Self-regulation means those companies set the rules.\"</p><p>Mr Chapman said that while online child sexual abuse was driven by a sexual interest in children, sadism and power over the vulnerable, a more fundamental reason was opportunity.</p><p>He said that the rapid expansion of social media to create huge networks provided \"huge opportunities\" for predatory paedophiles, and to tackle online sexual abuse the opportunity had to be removed.</p><p>He added: \"Sex, sadism, power are nothing new, they are as old as the hills and will never go away.</p><p>\"What's new and growing is the opportunity to indulge these. The internet provides that opportunity.\"</p><p>Mr Chapman called for bold action to regulate the big internet companies including companies having to check images and videos before they can be uploaded to their platforms as well as age and identity verification for people wishing to sign up to platforms and services.</p><p>He added: \"Be bold because this is a horrifying problem that is likely to grow exponentially.</p><p>\"Be bold because of the imbalance of power: on the one hand the immensely wealthy global organisations, on the other hand, children.</p><p>\"Be bold because the interests of big tech are not well aligned with child protection.\"</p><p>Mr Chapman also suggested there should be a new criminal offence of an adult posing as a child without reasonable excuse.</p><p>He added: \"We are not saying people should not be free to play with their identity online but there is a limit, a 60-year-old man has no business playing Peter Pan in Neverland.\"</p><p>Nick Griffin QC, representing the Home Office, told the inquiry that the Government had published its online harms white paper consultation and made it clear there had to be a \"model of regulation\".</p><p>But Mr Griffin said the Home Office recognised there was much more to do to tackle the problem.</p><p>He added: \"The most appalling and horrifying illegal content and activity remains prevalent on an unacceptable scale.</p><p>\"The white paper is recognition that the industry has to respond quickly to the evolving threat.</p><p>\"The Government has made clear that we need to move beyond a self-regulation model to a model of regulation.\"</p><p>Counsel to the inquiry Jacqueline Carey said the final investigation report is expected to be published early next year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELWEB-53218683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELWEB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W60-65D1-F021-63YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400553</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><timeReceived>3:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent News &amp;

Though that\u2019s really just the baby step where the Brexit negotiations are concerned.<br/> Parliamentarians have another vote on the bill this afternoon, during its third reading, and the legislative timetable is tight, given that the pan-EU General Data Protection Act (GDPR) takes direct effect on May 25 \u2014 and many provisions in the UK bill are intended to bring domestic law into line with that regulation, and complete implementation ahead of the EU deadline.<br/> Despite the UK referendum vote to pull the country out of the EU, the government has committed to complying with GDPR \u2014 which ministers hope will lay a strong foundation for it to secure a future agreement with the EU that allows data to continue flowing, as is critical for business. Although what exactly that future data regime might be remains to be seen \u2014 and various scenarios were discussed during today\u2019s hearing \u2014 hence there\u2019s further operational uncertainty for businesses in the years ahead.<br/> \u201cGetting the data policy right is of critical importance both on the commercial side but also on the security and law enforcement side,\u201d said Denham. \u201cWe need data to continue to flow and if we\u2019re not part of the unified framework in the EU then we have to make sure that we\u2019re focused and we\u2019re robust about putting in place measures to ensure that data continues to flow appropriately, that it\u2019s safeguarded and also that there is business certainty in advance of our exit from the EU.<br/> \u201cData underpins everything that we do and it\u2019s critically important.\u201d<br/> Another witness to the committee, James Mullock, a partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird, warned that the Brexit-shaped threat to UK-EU data flows could result in a situation akin to what happened after the long-standing Safe Harbor arrangement between the EU and the US was struck down in 2015 \u2014 leaving thousands of companies scrambling to put in place alternative data transfer mechanisms.<br/> \u201cIf we have anything like that it would be extremely disruptive,\u201d warned Mullock. \u201cAnd it will, I think, be extremely off-putting in terms of businesses looking at where they will headquarter themselves in Europe. And therefore the long term prospects of attracting businesses from many of the sectors that this country supports so well.\u201d<br/> \u201cEssentially what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re putting the burden on business to find a legal agreement or a legal mechanism to agree data protection standards on an overseas recipient so all UK businesses that receive data from Europe will be having to sign these agreements or put in place these mechanisms to receive data from the European Union which is obviously one of our very major senders of data to this country,\u201d he added of the alternative legal mechanisms fall-back scenario.<br/> Another witness, Giles Derrington, head of Brexit policy for UK technology advocacy organization, TechUK, explained how the collapse of Safe Harbor had saddled businesses with major amounts of bureaucracy \u2014 and went on to suggest that a similar scenario befalling the UK as a result of Brexit could put domestic startups at a big disadvantage vs tech giants.<br/> \u201cWe had a member company who had to put in place two million Standard Contractual Clauses over the space of a month or so [after Safe Harbor was struck down],\u201d he told the committee. \u201cThe amount of cost, time, effort that took was very, very significant. That\u2019s for a very large company.<br/> \u201cThe other side of this is the alternatives are highly exclusionary \u2014 or could be highly exclusionary to smaller businesses. If you look at India for example, who have been trying to get an adequacy agreement with the EU for about ten years, what you\u2019ve actually found now is a gap between those large multinationals, who can put in place binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, have the kind of capital to be able to do that \u2014 and it gives them an access to the European market which frankly most smaller businesses don\u2019t have from India.<br/> \u201cWe obviously wouldn\u2019t want to see that in a UK tech sector which is an awful lot of startups, scale-ups, and is a key part of the ecosystem which makes the UK a tech hub within Europe.\u201d<br/> Denham made a similar point. \u201cBinding corporate rules133; might work for multinational companies [as an alternative data transfer mechanism] that have the ability to invest in that process,\u201d she noted. \u201cCodes of conduct and certification are other transfer mechanisms that could be used but there are very few codes of practice and certification mechanisms in place at this time. So, although that could be a future transfer mechanism133; we don\u2019t have codes and certifications that have been approved by authorities at this time.\u201d<br/> \u201cI think it would be easier for multinational companies and large companies, rather than small businesses and certainly microbusinesses, that make up the lion\u2019s share of business in the UK, especially in tech,\u201d she added of the fall-back scenarios.<br/> Giving another example of the scale of the potential bureaucracy nightmare, Stephen Hurley, head of Brexit planning and policy for UK ISP British Telecom, told the committee it has more than 18,000 suppliers. \u201cIf we were to put in place Standard Contractual Clauses it would be a subset of those suppliers but we\u2019d have to identify where the flows of data would be coming from \u2014 in particular from the EU to the UK \u2014 and put in place those contractual clauses,\u201d he said.<br/> \u201cThe other problem with the contractual clauses is they\u2019re a set form, they\u2019re a precedent form that the Commission issues. And again that isn\u2019t necessarily designed to deal with the modern ways of doing business \u2014 the way flows of data occurs in practice. So it\u2019s quite a cumbersome process. And133; [there\u2019s] uncertainty as well, given they are currently under challenge before the European courts, a lot of companies now are already doing a sort of \u2018belt and braces\u2019 where even if you rely on Privacy Shield you\u2019ll also put in place an alternative transfer mechanism to allow you to have a fall back in case one gets temporarily removed.\u201d<br/> A better post-Brexit scenario than every UK business having to do the bureaucratic and legal leg-work themselves would be the UK government securing a new data flow arrangement with the EU. Not least because, as Hurley mentioned, Standard Contractual Clauses are subject to a legal challenge, with legal question marks now extended to Privacy Shield too.<br/> But what shape any such future UK-EU data transfer arrangement could take remains tbc.<br/> The panel of witnesses agreed that personal data flows would be very unlikely to be housed within any future trade treaty between the UK and the EU. Rather data would need to live within a separate treaty or bespoke agreement, if indeed such a deal can be achieved.<br/> Another possibility is for the UK to receive an adequacy decision from the EC \u2014 such as the Commission has granted to other third countries (like the US). But there was consensus on the panel that some form of bespoke data arrangement would be a superior outcome \u2014 for legal reasons but also for reciprocity and more.<br/> Mullock\u2019s view is a treaty would be preferable as it would be at lesser risk of a legal challenge. \u201cI\u2019m saying a treaty is preferable to a decision but we should take what we can get,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a treaty is the ultimate standard to aim for.\u201d<br/> Denham agreed, underlining how an adequacy decision would be much more limiting. \u201cI would say that a bespoke agreement or a treaty is preferable because that implies mutual recognition of each of our data protection frameworks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt contains obligations on both sides, it would contain dispute mechanisms. If we look at an adequacy decision by the Commission that is a one-way decision judging the standard of UK law and the framework of UK law to be adequate according to the Commission and according to the Council. So an agreement would be preferable but it would have to be a standalone treaty or a standalone agreement that\u2019s about data \u2014 and not integrate it into a trade agreement because of the fundamental rights element of data protection.\u201d<br/> Such a bespoke arrangement could also offer a route for the UK to negotiate and retain some role for her office within EU data protection regulation after Brexit.<br/> Because as it stands, with the UK set to exit the EU next year \u2014 and even if an adequacy decision was secured \u2014 the ICO will lose its seat at the table at a time when EU privacy laws are setting the new global standard, thanks to GDPR.<br/> \u201cUnless a role for the ICO was negotiated through a bespoke agreement or a treaty there\u2019s no way in law at present that we could participate in the one-stop shop [element of GDPR, which allows for EU DPAs to co-ordinate regulatory actions] \u2014 which would bring huge advantages to both sides and also to British businesses,\u201d said Denham.<br/> \u201cAt this time when the GDPR is in its infancy, participating in shaping and interpreting the law I think is really important. And the group of regulators that sit around the table at the EU are the most influential blocs of regulators \u2014 and if we\u2019re outside of that group and we\u2019re an observer we\u2019re not going to have the kind of effect that we need to have with big tech companies. Because that\u2019s all going to be decided by that group of regulators.\u201d<br/> \u201cThe European Data Protection Board will set the weather when it comes to standards for artificial intelligence, for technologies, for regulating big tech. So we will be a less influential regulator, we will continue to regulate the law and protect UK citizens as we do now, but we won\u2019t be at the leading edge of interpreting the GDPR \u2014 and we won\u2019t be bringing British values to that table if we\u2019re not at the table,\u201d she added.<br/> Hurley also made the point that if the ICO is not inside the GDPR one-stop shop mechanism then UK companies will have to choose another data protection agency within the EU to act as their lead regulator \u2014 describing this as \u201cagain another burden which we want to avoid\u201d.<br/> The panel was asked about opportunities for domestic divergence on elements of GDPR once the UK is outside the EU. But no one saw much advantage to be eked out outside a regulatory regime that is now responsible for the de facto global standard for data protection.<br/> \u201cGDPR is by no means perfect and there are a number of issues that we have with it. Having said that because GDPR has global reach it is now effectively being seen as we have to comply with this at an international level by a number of our largest members, who are rolling it out worldwide \u2014 not just Europe-wide \u2014 so the opportunities for divergence are quite limited,\u201d said Derrington. \u201cParticularly actually in areas like AI. AI requires massive amounts of data sets. So you can\u2019t do that just from a UK only data-set of 60 million people if you took everyone. You need more data than that.<br/> \u201cIf you were to use European data, which most of them would, then that will require you to comply with GDPR. So actually even if you could do things which would make it easier for some of the AI processes to happen by doing so you\u2019d be closing off your access to the data-sets \u2014 and so most of the companies I\u2019ve spoken to133; see GDPR as that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to comply with. We\u2019d much rather it be one rule133; and to be able to maintain access to [EU] data-sets rather than just applying dual standards when they\u2019re going to have to meet GDPR anyway.\u201d<br/> He also noted that about two-thirds of TechUK members are small and medium sized businesses, adding: \u201cA small business working in AI still needs massive amounts of data.<br/> \u201cFrom a tech sector perspective, considering whether data protection sits in the public consciousness now, actually don\u2019t see there being much opportunity to change GDPR. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily where the centre of gravity amongst the public is \u2014 if you look at the data protection bill, as it went through both houses, most of the amendments to the bill were to go further, to strengthen data protection. So actually we don\u2019t necessarily see this is idea that we will significantly walk back GDPR. And bear in mind that any company which are doing any work with the EU would have to comply with GDPR anyway.\u201d<br/> The possibility for legal challenges to any future UK-EU data arrangement were also discussed during the hearing, with Denham saying that scrutiny of the UK\u2019s surveillance regime once it is outside the EU is inevitable \u2014 though she suggested the government will be able to win over critics if it can fully articulate its oversight regime.<br/> \u201cWhether the UK proceeds with an adequacy assessment or whether we go down the road of looking at a bespoke agreement or a treaty we know, as we\u2019ve seen with the Privacy Shield, that there will be scrutiny of our intelligence services and the collection, use and retention of data. So we can expect that,\u201d she said, before arguing the UK has a \u201cgood story\u201d to tell on that front \u2014 having recently reworked its domestic surveillance framework and included accepting the need to make amendments to the law following legal challenges.<br/> \u201cAccountability, transparency and oversight of our intelligence service needs to be explained and discussed to our [EU] colleagues but there is no doubt that it will come under scrutiny \u2014 and my office was part of the most recent assessment of the Privacy Shield. And looking at the US regime. So we\u2019re well aware of the kind of questions that are going to be asked \u2014 including our arrangement with the Five Eyes, so we have to be ready for that,\u201d she added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN805113420180510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S95-8YP1-DXCW-D0VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 10, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On Friday, Britain will officially leave the European Union, after more than four decades with the closest of ties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What will change? Nothing! At least, at first.</p><p>For the rest of 2020, free trade and free movement between the United Kingdom and the E.U. will continue. Britain will still contribute to the E.U. budget. And it will still have to abide by E.U. laws \" even though British members of the European Parliament will have packed their bags and lost their say in how those laws are determined. </p><p>The biggest jolt to British politics in a generation won't be felt by most until the end of an 11-month transition period. That's when everyone will see a profound change in Britain's relationship with Europe and the world. And there's still lots that needs sorting between now and then. Here's what's on the to-do list.</p><p>Secure fish and chips</p><p>It's all about cod.</p><p>British fishing folk, and the folk who love them, have been banging on for years about rapacious Irish, French and Danish fleets over-exploiting rich British waters. </p><p>Fisheries account for a tiny percent \" a mere minnow \" of Britain's gross domestic product and employ just 24,000 people. But the issue is highly emotional, stirring up nationalist fervor.</p><p>Johnson has vowed that Britain will \" no matter what else \" reclaim its 'spectacular maritime wealth.'</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned on the BBC on Monday: 'You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services' in a post-Brexit trade deal.</p><p>The Cod War of 2020 is just beginning.</p><p>Hold on to those 450-million European consumers</p><p>During the transition period, Britain will remain in the E.U.'s custom union and single market, but after that, everything is up for grabs.</p><p>Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has declared that the U.K. wants a 'zero tariff, zero quota' trade pact with the E.U. by the end of the year.</p><p>But the new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned \" in a very friendly, very warm, very public way \" that it is almost certainly 'impossible' for the two sides to complete a comprehensive agreement within this 'very tight' schedule. She suggested that Johnson will have to ask for a delay. Or accept a partial deal \" and keep talking.</p><p>The prime minister insists he will walk away if his deadlines are blown and head (again) for the dreaded cliff edge of a no-deal departure. Not everyone believes this.</p><p>Strike a deal with President Trump \" or his successor</p><p>Once the U.K. is officially out of the E.U., it can start to negotiate with countries that don't already have trade deals with the E.U. At the top of that list is the United States.</p><p>President Trump, a fan of Brexit, has promised a 'massive' deal. Both sides have said they want to hammer something out quickly. But there could be stumbling blocks, including over drug prices and taxes on big tech companies.</p><p>There's also the debate about 'chlorinated chicken.'</p><p>Believe it or not, this is a big thing. Bigger than cod. </p><p>To have easy, free trade of agricultural goods, Europe is pressing Britain to remain aligned with E.U. rules on food safety and animal welfare. But that puts Britain on a collision course with the United States and its relatively lax regulations on industrial farming. American food processors rinse their poultry in a chlorine bath and shoot up their beef with antibiotics \" both no-nos in Europe.</p><p>Whether Johnson will bow to the Americans on chlorinated chicken and on allowing U.S. pharmaceutical companies access to the U.K. health-service market were both points of contention in last month's general election. Brits will be watching what he does.</p><p>Then strike a deal with everybody else</p><p>As Britain goes its own way, it will effectively withdraw from hundreds of pacts signed between the E.U. and the rest of the world.</p><p>The Financial Times counted more than 750 treaties 'running to hundreds of thousands of pages and spanning 168 non-EU countries. Within them are covered almost every external function of a modern economy, from flying planes to America and trading sows with Iceland to fishing in far-flung seas.'</p><p>Johnson's government has said most of these treaties will be quickly dispatched with a few added lines of text and rubber-stamped by the sides. </p><p>In any case, Britain will need lots of ink.</p><p>Print new passports and 'take back control' of borders</p><p>Britain will begin introducing spiffy new passports \" blue, like in the good old days \" early this year. By mid-2020, all new British passports will be blue.</p><p>But they won't have that 'European Union' stamp on the front cover, which allows the 500-million citizens of the bloc to travel effortlessly across the member states. </p><p>Free movement will continue through the transition period. Londoners can still freely move to Lisbon, and Berliners can take jobs in Birmingham. But E.U. citizens living in Britain must apply for residency rights by June 2021 \" or they will be in the country illegally. </p><p>Going forward, Europeans won't get automatic preference over people from other countries who want to live and work in the U.K. And Brits won't as easily be able to live and work in Europe.</p><p>Johnson will soon unveil a post-Brexit immigration plan, which is expected to be something akin to Australia's point-based method. Immigration was a huge driver in the 2016  referendum on E.U. membership, with Brexiteers promising to 'take back control' of Britain's borders. Johnson will want to say he's achieved that goal.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:william.booth@washpost.com\">william.booth@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:karla.adam@washpost.com\">karla.adam@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-f7ebd2a0-4112-11ea-99c7-1dfd4241a2fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y37-FHD1-DXXY-32NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

On Friday, Britain will officially leave the European Union, after more than four decades with the closest of ties.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What will change? Nothing! At least, at first.</p><p>For the rest of 2020, free trade and free movement between the United Kingdom and the E.U. will continue. Britain will still contribute to the E.U. budget. And it will still have to abide by E.U. laws \" even though British members of the European Parliament will have packed their bags and lost their say in how those laws are determined. </p><p>The biggest jolt to British politics in a generation won't be felt by most until the end of an 11-month transition period. That's when everyone will see a profound change in Britain's relationship with Europe and the world. And there's still lots that needs sorting between now and then. Here's what's on the to-do list.</p><p>          Secure fish and chips                    </p><p>It's all about cod.</p><p>British fishing folk, and the folk who love them, have been banging on for years about rapacious Irish, French and Danish fleets over-exploiting rich British waters. </p><p>Fisheries account for a tiny percent \" a mere minnow \" of Britain's gross domestic product and employ just 24,000 people. But the issue is highly emotional, stirring up nationalist fervor.</p><p>Johnson has vowed that Britain will \" no matter what else \" reclaim its 'spectacular maritime wealth.'</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned on the BBC on Monday: 'You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services' in a post-Brexit trade deal.</p><p>The Cod War of 2020 is just beginning.</p><p>          Hold on to those 450-million European consumers                    </p><p>During the transition period, Britain will remain in the E.U.'s custom union and single market, but after that, everything is up for grabs.</p><p>Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has declared that the U.K. wants a 'zero tariff, zero quota' trade pact with the E.U. by the end of the year.</p><p>But the new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned \" in a very friendly, very warm, very public way \" that it is almost certainly 'impossible' for the two sides to complete a comprehensive agreement within this 'very tight' schedule. She suggested that Johnson will have to ask for a delay. Or accept a partial deal \" and keep talking.</p><p>The prime minister insists he will walk away if his deadlines are blown and head (again) for the dreaded cliff edge of a no-deal departure. Not everyone believes this.</p><p>          Strike a deal with President Trump \" or his successor                    </p><p>Once the U.K. is officially out of the E.U., it can start to negotiate with countries that don't already have trade deals with the E.U. At the top of that list is the United States.</p><p>President Trump, a fan of Brexit, has promised a 'massive' deal. Both sides have said they want to hammer something out quickly. But there could be stumbling blocks, including over drug prices and taxes on big tech companies.</p><p>There's also the debate about 'chlorinated chicken.'</p><p>Believe it or not, this is a big thing. Bigger than cod. </p><p>To have easy, free trade of agricultural goods, Europe is pressing Britain to remain aligned with E.U. rules on food safety and animal welfare. But that puts Britain on a collision course with the United States and its relatively lax regulations on industrial farming. American food processors rinse their poultry in a chlorine bath and shoot up their beef with antibiotics \" both no-nos in Europe.</p><p>Whether Johnson will bow to the Americans on chlorinated chicken and on allowing U.S. pharmaceutical companies access to the U.K. health-service market were both points of contention in last month's general election. Brits will be watching what he does.</p><p>          Then strike a deal with everybody else                    </p><p>As Britain goes its own way, it will effectively withdraw from hundreds of pacts signed between the E.U. and the rest of the world.</p><p>The Financial Times counted more than 750 treaties 'running to hundreds of thousands of pages and spanning 168 non-EU countries. Within them are covered almost every external function of a modern economy, from flying planes to America and trading sows with Iceland to fishing in far-flung seas.'</p><p>Johnson's government has said most of these treaties will be quickly dispatched with a few added lines of text and rubber-stamped by the sides. </p><p>In any case, Britain will need lots of ink.</p><p>          Print new passports and 'take back control' of borders          </p><p>Britain will begin introducing spiffy new passports \" blue, like in the good old days \" early this year. By mid-2020, all new British passports will be blue.</p><p>But they won't have that 'European Union' stamp on the front cover, which allows the 500-million citizens of the bloc to travel effortlessly across the member states. </p><p>Free movement will continue through the transition period. Londoners can still freely move to Lisbon, and Berliners can take jobs in Birmingham. But E.U. citizens living in Britain must apply for residency rights by June 2021 \" or they will be in the country illegally. </p><p>Going forward, Europeans won't get automatic preference over people from other countries who want to live and work in the U.K. And Brits won't as easily be able to live and work in Europe.</p><p>Johnson will soon unveil a post-Brexit immigration plan, which is expected to be something akin to Australia's point-based method. Immigration was a huge driver in the 2016  referendum on E.U. membership, with Brexiteers promising to 'take back control' of Britain's borders. Johnson will want to say he's achieved that goal.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:william.booth@washpost.com\">william.booth@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:karla.adam@washpost.com\">karla.adam@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-f7ebd2a0411211ea99c71dfd4241a2fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y37-9J41-DYX1-H39R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 125 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0050: Unparseable date: \"0050\"EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

Who would have predicted that this was the way Britain would end its five-decade membership of the European Union? Today, as the 11th hour approaches, there will be no street parties or pealing of bells in celebration, nor are there angry demonstrations and defiant protests of outrage. The exhausted nation is hardly aware that, after all the acrimony, the moment of departure is upon us. Brexit is done. The best the governing party can manage to mark the event that has consumed all its political energies, and dispatched two of its leaders, is a commemorative mug and tea towel. Why? Because whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure.</p><p>For the Remainers the defeat is absolute. We can lament the mistaken decision to call a referendum, and the lacklustre, unemotional campaign. We can rue the errors that followed, as overly-moderate Tory rebels pitched their fight on the method rather than the substance of our departure; while the extremist Labour leadership and naive Liberal Democrats proved unwitting handmaidens to our exit and their own destruction. But the facts are these: after half a century of membership, appeals in the 2016 referendum to a common European identity fell on millions of deaf ears; and after three years of economic stagnation since, and transparent evidence that the promises of Brexit were false, the voters reaffirmed their decision in a second vote in the election last Whatever you have the debate has cleaved society in today a failure month. So the truth must be faced by all who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, including this newspaper: we did not convince our fellow citizens.</p><p>If the failure of pro-Europeans is obvious, why are the celebrations of Brexiteers so muted? In part, because they too know they have not convinced the nation. Britain walks through the exit door with a feeling of melancholic resignation rather than excitement about the future. The nation knows it has chosen the poorer path - the estimates produced by the Bank of England yesterday show an economy barely growing, with a trend rate not seen since the Seventies. The country also knows it has greatly diminished its voice in the world - already our views on everything from climate goals to the taxation of big tech matter far less.</p><p>The more thoughtful leaders of the Brexit campaign know too that they prevailed by harnessing a nativist opposition to change and a resentment at the success of others in parts of the country, outside the cities of the North and South, that felt left behind. They talk of levelling up, but they won on the argument of levelling down: if you can't enjoy the fruits of globalisation, then nor should anyone <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.else.No\">www.else.No</url> one beyond the offices of a few deluded hedge funds in Mayfair believes Brexit was a vote for less red tape and more free trade. The party that now represents Sedgefield and Blyth Valley champions more government intervention, higher spending and extra regulation. Yesterday, the Conservatives were trumpeting their re-nationalisation of the Northern railways, the kind of state involvement in the economy that we joined the EU to get away from. \"Global Britain\" may be the slogan, but neither the globe nor Britain believe a word of it.</p><p>side taken in that our half, represents So what lies ahead? Ignore those who say that Brexit isn't done. It is. Yes, there's a trade agreement to be negotiated - and the details matter a lot to businesses - but it's a much less important decision than the existential one we've just taken about whether we are members of the EU. There will be an argument about \"divergence\" - but the truth is that, in most areas, global standard-setting and the European markets will force us to be a taker of the rules we have until today participated in making. That's why the hard Brexit on paper will feel much softer in practice. Even the hour of our departure - midnight Central European Time - is set by others. It will take time for this loss of control to become apparent - but when it does, the same questions that faced Britain 50 years ago will confront us now: how do we exert our influence in the world? How do we sustain support for the free markets and the open society? US Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously said of post-war Britain that we had lost an empire but not yet found a role. Back in 1972, we thought we had by joining the European community. In 2020, as we leave, it's time to come together - because we still haven't found what we're looking for.</p><p>Whatever side you have taken in the debate that has cleaved our society in half, today represents a failure</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTAND-157059688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTAND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3P-TPN1-JCBW-N4F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138528</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Evening Standard (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31730\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Loss of Consortium</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODNDRDA2NjQxNzRCNERGMTgxOTk1NEI5N0EzQUZCMDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzdGMUVGMjdBODg4NDRCMUJGMDY2MjNGRTM2NTJEOTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

The fact that we are a company in and of itself says that we resonate with the business sector.</p><p>\"We have a contract, not a manifesto. We don't believe in empty promises, we don't believe in marketing gimmicks around general elections.</p><p>\"We are brutally realistic and come from many professions and our contract is something that is a binding agreement between us and the people of the community.</p><p>\"So it's deliverable targets that we are specifically focussed on at this point in time.</p><p>\"We believe that capitalism and democracy are interwoven and that the deeper the democracy, the greater the opportunity for capitalism, and that includes social enterprises as well.</p><p>\"We have three fundamental aspects to our approach - independence, that allows us to be selfdetermining and self-governing, which allows us to control our investment framework. \"Then, our investment framework is based on regional regeneration, based on what we call a turbocharged economy, looking at very specific initiatives for small and medium-sized enterprises, the high street, for boosting the little businesses in this country.\"</p><p>She said after investment the third part of the approach was innovation, from \"political innovation\" such as abolishing the House of Lords, to \"social innovation\" in areas such as public services.</p><p>ANDREW BRIDGEN \"WHEN I became the MP for North West Leicestershire it was the most deprived area in Leicestershire. It's now enjoying the highest economic growth outside London and the South East.</p><p>\"This is the most important election probably in our lifetimes. We've said that every single election - this is my fourth General Election in less than 10 years - but this time it's the truth, I promise you.</p><p>\"There is a huge difference between the ideologies. The Conservative Party is a party that knows that everything good in the world starts with someone, somewhere making a profit and paying tax.</p><p>\"There is the difference in ideology between a government now under Boris Johnson that sees taxation as something that is essential to pay for the public services we all need and deserve, and the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn, which is the only other alternative government where taxation is seen as a way of punishing success, hard work and diligence.\"</p><p>ZUFFAR HAQ \"THIS election isn't about me, it's not even about the Liberal Democrats, it's about what kind of country we are going to be living in.</p><p>\"We have got hospitals here in Leicester that 300 to 400 nurses have left, who came from Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece.</p><p>\"We have the same problems in social care, where a lot of people who came in from Europe have now left, so care homes are struggling to get staff.</p><p>\"We've got the construction industry also struggling to get workers such as bricklayers, and we need housing because there is a huge shortage there.</p><p>\"We had the farmers only a few weeks ago saying millions of apples had been left on the trees because they've got nobody to pick those crops.</p><p>\"Farmers were telling me only last week it's not just the crop pickers, but we haven't got enough vets because there were European vets coming here.</p><p>\"We've also got shortages of abattoir staff as well.</p><p>\"So we've got a huge problem with Brexit. We need to remain and the reason we need to remain is we need those people to be able to come in.</p><p>\"We've got a whole list of car companies, Rolls-Royce, BMW, so many other companies, that are really scared about what's going on and they are looking at their investments and thinking 'is the UK the best place?' \"Really, are we going to close ourselves in and become isolationist and turn our backs on Europe and try to do a trade deal with Donald Trump? \"We are going to become the corner shop instead of the Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco of the world.\"</p><p>Q: How do you see the business and political landscape in five years' time? STUART BRADY BREXIT overshadows \"absolutely\" everything, he said, and the \"Get Brexit Done\" slogan was empty because it just applies to the Withdrawal Agreement - and actual future framework is unknown.</p><p>Negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with the EU could go \"on and on and on\" he said.</p><p>Those and other negotiations will lead to more uncertainty, so we need another referendum and he would campaign to remain.</p><p>A \u00a3400 billion, 10-year Labour gov-ernment fund would help the green economy, with additional investment on a par with some Scandinavian countries.</p><p>TARA BALDWIN SHE wants to re-address \"inadequacies\" in the balance of power.</p><p>Her party is a \"futuristic, radical, revolutionary\" party, offering political reform, deeper democracy, regional regeneration with do-able things \"on the ground today\".</p><p>She wants to bring business individuals and government together in a new way.</p><p>ANDREW BRIDGEN A MAJORITY Conservative government would leave the EU on or before January 31, as \"every\" Tory candidate has signed up to Boris Johnson's deal.</p><p>He said the transition period would mean quota and tariff free-trade with everything \"as is\" and no extension beyond December 31, 2020.</p><p>No-deal would be back on the table though, which he said was a \"guarantee\" the country would get a good deal, because there would be a \"walkaway\" position.</p><p>Also, during transition, the UK would be under EU laws, but with no say in them so would need the get-out clause in case the EU wanted to pass laws that were detrimental to the economy of the UK.</p><p>While negotiating with the EU, we would be able to negotiate free trade deals with other countries, which would end the uncertainty hanging over the business community like a \"dark cloud\".</p><p>He agreed that business investment and the economy had been suppressed by uncertainty but the EU \"desperately\" needed a free trade agreement with the UK.</p><p>ZUFFAR HAQ HE said it does not make sense to turn your back on your nearest trading partner and say you are going to do business with Australia, New Zealand or South America.</p><p>If you are Toyota, Nissan or Ford, you will be put off by no-deal staying on the table, creating more uncertainty.</p><p>The Tories, he said, are the Brexit party which means no security for business.</p><p>A second referendum would get it sorted once and for all, and staying in the EU would ensure the next electric car maker, for instance, will invest in Britain, not Berlin.</p><p>International companies come to the UK because of Europe and we are going to lose that.</p><p>Immigration, he said, helps the country move forward, because it brings in talent from the whole of Europe.</p><p>Q: How would they stop Amazon - which pays a low proportion of tax - putting more SMEs out of business? ZUFFAR HAQ AMAZON should pay the \"full, proper\" tax and retail rates, said Mr Haq.</p><p>Business rates should be reviewed, and small shops should be protected for people who find it hard to shop online.</p><p>ANDREW BRIDGEN IT is dangerous to attack Amazon, he said, because consumers have made the choice to buy online.</p><p>Amazon employs 1,000 people in his area and pay \u00a34 million a year business rates.</p><p>But planning needs to be relaxed to help shops.</p><p>Multi-nationals should not have safe havens to avoid paying tax. Maybe a turnover tax would help.</p><p>TARA BALDWIN SMES (small and medium enterprises) are the backbone of Britain, which helped this country win two wars, and there should be \"deep\" incentives to support them.</p><p>Her party would have zero corporate tax for small companies with low profits.</p><p>Online sales taxation should be increased to let business on the ground have a chance.</p><p>STUART BRADY LABOUR says multi-nationals should be taxed on economic activity \"within the jurisdiction\" in which that happens.</p><p>His party wants to take on monopolies and regulate them.</p><p>Maybe, big tech should be broken up to split conflicts of interest and not have a position of dominance.</p><p>Q: How would they restore public trust in politics? ZUFFAR HAQ THE language used by politicians has been \"terrible\", he said.</p><p>He added that everyone is entitled to their views, but that if you can't say something good, move on.</p><p>The leaders in particular need to change the way they talk to people.</p><p>ANDREW BRIDGEN HE said the reason so many MPs are standing down is they \"have not got the guts\" to stand on the doorstep and look the electorate in the eye because they have \"let them down so badly\".</p><p>TARA BALDWIN SHE said she wants the community to engage with her. Responding to them as a facilitator, rather than a leader, will restore trust.</p><p>STUART BRADY PARLIAMENT should have the same standards that you would find in a business. He said the threats MPs are getting from the public are partly because of the way the temperature has been \"ratcheted up by the surrender bill language, the traitor language and all the rest of it\". East Midlands Chamber of Commerce hosted a heated political debate at the Leicester Tigers' ground, to test the General Election hopefuls on what they are offering to back British business.</p><p>The four candidates under the spotlight were: \u00a6 Tara Baldwin, Brexit candidate for Leicester East (current MP Keith Vaz) \u00a6 Stuart Brady, Labour candidate for Loughborough (current MP Nicky Morgan) \u00a6 Andrew Bridgen, Tory candidate for North West Leicestershire (current MP) \u00a6 Zuffar Haq, Liberal Democrat candidate for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston (current MP Neil O'Brien) Chamber non-executive director Stuart Dawkins chaired the session</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEICMY-155262288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LEICMY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMF-B9X1-JCBW-N08R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166717</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Localworld All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Leicester Mercury</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 30, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

A rather feeble pathetic sort of gavel there.   Which perhaps justified when you look at how the marketed traded throughout  the course of the day.  We'll give you great analysis on what happened and  why.  But the day is over.  It is Monday, it's December the 4th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, a Brexit break through that blows a pause.  Talks in Brussels  falter at the last minute.  We'll be in Brussels and on Downing Street.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street gets a big payday from the tax vote.  The Dow is at a record,  barely and just.  And the fall of the \"House of Cards,\" Netflix announces  final season without Kevin Spacey.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest, tonight, live from the world financial capital, New York  City, where I mean business </p><p>Good evening, we start tonight with Brexit and the negotiations that have  stalled on the question of the Irish border.  The day began with smiles,  handshakes and optimism a deal could be reached.  That's Jean-Claude, the  president of the commission and Teresa May the British Prime Minister.   After intense hours of negotiations those hopes were dashed.  The PM and  the Commissioner warned crucial issues remain unresolved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT:  Despite our best  efforts and significant progress, we and our teams have made over the past  days on the agreement on issues, it was not possible to reach a complete  agreement today.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  And it's clear crucially that we want  to move forward together.  But on a couple of issues, some differences do  remain, which require further negotiation and consultation.  And those will  continue, but we will reconvene before the end of the week.  And I'm also  confident that we will conclude this positively.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Now the pound sterling tracked the ups and downs of the talks.   Look how you see it spiked before lunchtime in Brussels.  The word  seemingly good reports of a deal being done, and then it came crashing back  down as Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announced they had not made  sufficient progress.  </p><p>So, let's update you with the issues.  So, the big question, of course, the  dates until the U.K. leaves the EU, 480 days, 1 hour 57 a minutes and 20  seconds.  Everybody is obviously obsessed by that.  But that really doesn't  tell the whole story.  Because the actual time to do a deal, then to get it  ratified by Parliaments and then to get it ratified by national  governments.  If some cases it has to be.  Means that has actually a lot  less time than you would think.  </p><p>So, negotiations that had to be resolved before the talks.  OK, so the  first thing is the sequencing of how things are going to be dealt with.   What needs to be dealt with, before you can get from this side of the chart  to this side of the chart.  And then you got the EU exit bill.  So, there's  been substantial progress on the EU exit bill.  It's believed that Theresa  May is going to offer up to 50 billion pounds on the exit bill and that  should sort that out.  </p><p>You've got the citizens' rights.  There the snag has to do with the Court  of Justice and who's going to be allowed in and who is not.  The one thing  that's interesting is the Irish border, because it's the last hurdle and  Juncker was confident of an agreement this week.  The problem of course is,  that everybody had thought it was going to be -- it was sort of the hidden  issue that's suddenly come back.  </p><p>Now remember, they've got to get through all of this before they can start  talking about trade, legal security, and the two-year, three-year, whatever  it is transition period.  So, we're still firmly still stuck here.  And the  European counsel, which is December 14, that's when the British were hoping  to get the green light to start moving from this to that side.  Keep an eye  on this Irish border question, it's the one that's sticking at the moment.   We're covering it from both sides of the English Channel.  Erin McLaughlin  is in Brussels and Bianca Nobilo is in London.  Start with you Erin the  issue of Northern Ireland and this weird phrase regulatory alignment.  What  finally caused or what stymied the talks from success today?  </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well that is certainly the question of  today, Richard, it's what people here in Brussels are asking.  Here is what  we know in terms of how these events unfolded.  </p><p>[16:05:00] At the beginning of the day, all signs pointed to there being a  deal on the Northern Ireland issue, seen as one of, if not the most  contentious issue of these talks.  We heard from the Irish Tea Shock saying  that a was a deal in place between the EU, the U.K. and Ireland.  Then  Theresa May arrived she met with the president of the European Commission,  Jean-Claude Juncker, for a working lunch.  At some point, according to  British and Irish media reports, during that lunch there was a phone call  between Prime Minister May and the head of the DUP, Eileen Foster, that had  been as a critical -- </p><p>QUEST:  Let's pause there with that phone call because that phone call  takes us across to London, picking up the story, Bianca, what was that  phone call about?  </p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN PRODUCER:  Well, Arlene Foster who you just mentioned is  the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, the DUP.  That's the biggest  party in Northern Ireland.  That's the party that's propping up Theresa  May's minority government in the U.K. So, the Prime Minister relies on  DUP's support to pass all of her crucial Brexit bills and other government  bills of confidence which she needs in order to govern at all.</p><p>QUEST:  Stay with you, Bianca.  The DUP would not sign up to this deal that  was being put together in Brussels.  Is that right?  </p><p>NOBILO:  That is right.  The DUP have always been firm on being pro-Brexit  and pro-union.  That's what they stand for.  That they would never  countenance the idea of being treated differently from the rest of the U.K.  with regards to Brexit.  They didn't want to diverge from the rest of the  U.K. and be more like the Republic of Ireland.  They want to be pro-union  and with the rest of the U.K. </p><p>QUEST:  Erin, If that is the situation and regulatory alignment is not  possible, but they don't -- both sides say they don't want a hard border,  what happens next?  Could Northern Ireland be the ultimate sticking point?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, it certainly looks that way, Richard.  From the EU's  perspective, Theresa May needs to sort this out at home and then come back  with something along the same lines of the deal that was agreed in Brussels  earlier today.  That is what the Irish Tea Shock said.  He said it's fine  if you change the wording, but the meaning has to stay the same.  And  that's a regulatory alignment essentially, which is according to the draft  document that leaked here in Brussels earlier today.  Regulatory alignment  for Northern Ireland, it has to essentially remain a part of the single  market as well as the customs union.  </p><p>NOBILO:  Richard, I would add as well, that it's not just the DUP that  oppose this idea.  It's also hard core Brexiteers within the Prime  Minister's own government and also within the Labour Party, they don't want  to see any difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.  either </p><p>QUEST:  All right, Brussels, London, thank you, we'll see throughout the  course of the week.  Time is short in terms of what happened.  The impasse  in Brussels did not dent European shares.  Take a look at the numbers.   It's strong gains in Germany and France.  Very strong, up 1.5 percent in  Germany.  The DAX was the driver there.  Portugal's finance minister to  become the new Euro Group president.  That's interesting.  Remember the  Eurogroup, that's the Eurozone, it deals with matters of the Eurozone, and  the Eurogroup, Portugal now taking over.  </p><p>The tax vote drove U.S. stocks higher, come and join me, at the trading  post.  Paul.  good to see you.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>QUEST:  We'll be with you in just a moment.  Stay comfortable.  Guru Paul  La Monica will be giving us perspective on a variety of issues.</p><p>The Dow -- only the Dow is at a record.  Now bear in mind they sort of hit  intraday highs, but fell off late in the session.  The Dow was up 300  points at one point, but by the end, it just ekes out a small gain.  It's  hardly worth -- it's an interesting one here because do we go green in the  wall or red in the wall?  I think today, we have to go red in the wall.   Because we had two of the major markets, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq that  were lower, the Nasdaq sizably lower.  It is artificial to say that it was  a particularly good day just because the Dow gets up over to a record high,  even though it does get to a record high and the rotation continues.  So,  you get at that number -- Paul, would you agree with me, that we perhaps  have to call this a down day, even though I know people are getting very  excited that the Dow was at a record.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we do, the Dow, as the name implies, has 30 stocks in  it.  The S&amp;P has only 500 -- has 500 companies.  </p><p>[16:10:00] the Nasdaq has even more.  This was a down day.  You had a  handful of stocks, banks in particular that did go up.  But the tax  euphoria has already started to fade, because reality is setting in.  Now  the bills have to be reconciled.  That may be easier said than said and  done, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Even this morning, the Nasdaq didn't join in the rally, which I  don't understand.  Because Nasdaq big tech firms like Amazon and Apple  stand to gain by those provisions on lower corporate taxes and the  repatriation of overseas profits.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  That is true.  I think though that those companies have been  beat up all year partly because of all the cash they have and the  expectation they might bring it back.  Increased dividends, increased buy  backs.  Their fundamentals are healthy too.  But the problem is everyone  knows that.  Is it a secret that Facebook is one of the best run companies  on the planet?  Or that Apple and Amazon are?  Not at all.  The good news  here is that the overall market is not falling apart just because tech is  starting to slide.  And I think there were a lot of people worried.  We had  gotten so heavy with those big five tech companies.  Microsoft was one of  the worst performers in the Dow today.  </p><p>QUEST:  The Fang+ Index, which is what we're going to start looking at  more.  That's Fang, plus Alibaba --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Microsoft, others.  </p><p>QUEST:  That was down 2.5 percent today.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, there just is this general sense that the easy money, I  think, has been made in technology and other areas of the market.  Banks,  maybe energy stocks, are starting to look a little bit more attractive.   And the good news is, we're not seeing as of yet, a fear that the whole  market is overvalued, because people are just fleeing sectors, not the  entire market.  </p><p>QUEST:  The -- I can hear the view of being very concerned there.  It looks  as if -- I mean, is tech taking a break, or is tech taking a beating?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I wouldn't go so far as to say they're taking a beating, given  that all of these companies are still very, very dominant.  Have strong  earnings growth expectations, a heck of a lot of cash.  Having the pull  back that we have seen today with FacebookMicrosoft, Google.  It's healthy </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.</p><p>Now have a listen to this.  Now, the first time you hear it, oh, it's  lovely makes you swell with holiday cheer and bright.  The question is,  after you have heard it for the 1,500th time, what happens then?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  So, there is the story of the day on Wall Street straight out of  the gate, we open at a record.  We go higher by 300 points, and it's all  because of the potential for a tax cut and taking that.  But that  evaporated as the day wore on towards the close.  And by the close, we are  just up .25 of a percentage point at 58 points.</p><p>[16:15:06] Figure it got to nearly 24,290.  The Dow was on track for  another triple digit gain.  And then it just sort of lost steam.  Last week  the rally was interrupted by the Michael Flynn drama on Friday.  Just look  at that, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, triple digit gains and you see what  happens on Friday.  Mr. Trump said the markets will continue their  momentum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The stock market I think is  going to have a very big day, based on the massive tax cuts that we're very  much in the process of getting approved.  But based on the vote we had last  week, the stock market has been reacting unbelievably well.  With the only  thing that hurts it is the fake news, and there's plenty of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Stephen Moore helped draft Donald Trump's tax plan during the  presidential campaign, he joins me now from Seattle.  Good to see you, sir,  as always.  </p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hi, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  So, you've got the two competing plans now.  You know, the reality  is, I was looking at the differences between them.  They're not huge.  I  mean, arguably, the biggest difference is the number of tax brackets, the  pass-through rule and the expiration of the individual part -- oh, and the  mandate aspect, the health care mandate.  Can they be easily reconciled?  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, yes, real easily.  And look, the Republicans don't want to  fail here.  They know they can't fail, Richard.  So, they're going to get  something -- by the way I'm hearing now that it will be Thursday or Friday  that they start the reconciliation process between the two bills.  Not sure  how long that's going to take, but it won't take more than three or four  days.  So, we should have a vote probably not this week, but next week on  the final passage of this.  </p><p>One of the big issues of difference is what is going to happened to the  small business tax rate.  The Senate bill passes -- lowers that rate to  about 30 percent, where it's closer to about 35 percent in the House bill.   But look, I think the big story is here, that this is pro-growth.  You  mentioned the stock market, it's really been on a boom now for the last  couple of months as investors have become more and more confident that this  tax bill is going to happen.  Whether it's running a little bit ahead of  itself, I can't say.  I mean, there's a lot of exuberance out here.  But  the real question is, is this going to translate into real gains for the  economy next year.  And I'm on the side that says that it will.  That we're  going to see a good 2018 as a result of these were reduced tax rates.  </p><p>QUEST:  But Stephen, the issue of the longer-term deficit, when you have  the Senate scoring says that the deficit goes up by over a trillion, and  you want to assume that -- the people who come up with that score are as  familiar with the economic argument of trickle down as anybody else.  Now I  know they don't include that directly.  They don t account for the actual  economic increase.  Do you honestly believe that the increased economic  taxation will make up the deficit of a trillion?  </p><p>MOORE:  Well, that's a great question.  First of all, the number one job  that Donald Trump has is to get the economy moving again.  We have been in  a 10-year ditch in the American economy.  We haven't grown by more than 2  percent for ten years.  The reason the debt grew so rapidly under Bush and  under Obama, was the economy just underperformed.  That, Richard, you  cannot -- I've looked at these numbers sideways, upside down, any way you  look at them, you're not going to make any progress in terms of reducing  our debt until you get the economy moving.  Now, Trump has done that big  time.  I mean, we're up to 3 to 3.5 percent already.  That's up from 1.5  percent in Obama's last year.  That's a big, big increase.  And I think we  can keep that growth going.  And I would make the case -- if you get the  economy moving faster at a sustained level, that debt burden is going to  fall.  I'm not saying that those tax cuts are going to pay for themselves,  I'm saying our ability to absorb the debt is much easier to, you know, to  pay off if you've got a growing in prosperous economy.  </p><p>QUEST:  I am confused in my weekend reading -- in my weekend reading I am  confused because --  </p><p>MOORE:  I thought you said weakened reading -- weekend reading.</p><p>QUEST:  On the one hand, you know, I read that the growth cannot be  attributed to the president, it is the hangover legacy of eight years of  Yellen and Obama and the way in which they constructed the recovery.  On  the other hand, I have the president tell us at every turn it's all about  him.  He's only been in office for six months, or nine months, ten months.   This can't really be his recovery?  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, sure it is.  I think it's irrefutable that it is.  And the  evidence of that is look what happened to the stock market the day after  the election where the stocks went up by 700 points.  </p><p>[16:20:00] That wasn't a coincidence.  We have a pro-business president  right now.  There's no question about it.  Obama was anti-business.  This  is a president that who is pro-business.  Some people think he's too pro- business, but there is no question, the reduction in the regulation.  The  anticipation of this tax cut has had a big effect.  Now, Richard, you are a  smart guy, you are smart economic analyst.  There's no way you can look at  an economy that was slowing down in 2016, we only had 1.5 percent growth in  the year 2016.  And then you see this curve go straight up after the Trump  election.  There's a Trump effect here, it's not just a Trump bounce.  I  think it's a Trump moon bounce and I anticipate it to continue into 2018- 2019 </p><p>QUEST:  Stephen, when your next time you're in New York, we've got a seat  for you here.  Please come and join me.  We'll have a chat.</p><p>MOORE:  I would love to.  Love your show.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you Stephen.</p><p>MOORE:  Every time I travel abroad, I watch your show.  </p><p>QUEST:  There we are then.  Good, thank you.  We like this robust  discussion on economics.  Which of course, is our part of our conversation.   And we'll continue that now with our next guest.  A source is telling CNN,  Netflix will resume production of the smash hit TV series, \"House of Cards\"  without Kevin Spacey as the U.S. president, Frank Underwood.  The show's  future has been uncertain.  There are numerous allegations.  You're all  familiar with that of miss conduct against the Hollywood star.  Chloe is  with me.  Now hang on, I'm confused.  I'm confused a lot tonight.  What did  we know until today?  We knew they were going to try and finish the current  series.  </p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Right, well, no, this is not  true, Richard Quest.  Let me explain and let me unconfused you if I may.   So, \"House of Cards\" suspended production.  Netflix, the company behind the  show, Media Rights Capital, after the allegations of sexual misconduct on  set in my CNN report came forward, they suspended the show, leaving  hundreds of people who work on \"House of Cards\" in limbo.  They were paying  them the hiatus through the break, but their lives, their future, they  show, fans at home, nobody knew.</p><p>QUEST:  So, they suspended production to be shown when?  </p><p>MELAS:  They just suspended production of season six.  They were in the  middle of filming season six which was set to premier in 2018.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  So now what are they going to do with season six?  </p><p>MELAS:  They're going to start filming again.  And they're going to start  filming after the new year.  And so, that means that hundreds of people  have jobs.  They can feed their families through Christmas and the  holidays.  This is a joyous occasion for the people who have spent so many  seasons telling the \"House of Cards\" stories.  But it's been crazy, I can  tell you, speaking to sources, for the writers.  Having to rewrite this  that they spent months writing season six.  And then they had to rewrite it  in just a few weeks, so it's been a scramble writing out Kevin Spacey's  character -- </p><p>QUEST:  Without him -- I mean, it's now you see me, now you don't.  </p><p>MELAS:  Right.</p><p>QUEST:  One episode he's there.  Next episode he's not going to be there.   And it's how you going to get rid of him between the two.</p><p>MELAS:  Well, exactly.  Now in the original series that this show is based  on they kill off Kevin Spacey's character.  So, there's a chance that Kevin Spacey will be  killed off in the first episode, or were not exactly sure how the writers  are going to frame it.  But he will not be on anymore.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, they've got to kill him off.  </p><p>MELAS:  Yes.  We're not sure, maybe he goes away on a long-extended  vacation somewhere.  Rides off into the sunset.</p><p>QUEST:  I have a year or two on you, and so I'm old enough to remember  Dallas.  I think it was Bobby Ewing, who came back after several months of  being in a sleep coma.  We thought he was going to be truly killed off, so  they managed to bring him back.  So, they're going to get rid of him.  </p><p>MELAS:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  And this is the end of season six.  </p><p>MELAS:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  What happens after that?</p><p>MELAS:  We're not sure if the show -- the show is definitely not going to  continue at all.  So, Netflix had said that season six would be its last  season.  </p><p>QUEST:  And that's still the case?  </p><p>MELAS:  This is still the case, and Richard, I can tell you though, we have  been waiting for a response from Kevin Spacey.  You know, his team really  no longer exists, because everybody has dropped him in the wake of these  allegations, with the exception of his attorney.  You know, we don't know  where he is.  We think that perhaps he might still be in rehab, which is  the last we heard about a month ago.  So, we haven't heard from him, his  thoughts on being ousted from this show that he's been a part of since the  beginning.  </p><p>QUEST:  One can certainly say though that the audience for that particular  episode, between the before and the after, will be fairly humongous, and  trying to keep a secret of what they've done with him is going to be very  difficult?  </p><p>MELAS:  It's going to be difficult especially when you have reporters like  myself who are always trying to break the scoop, so.  I'll tell you, I'll  keep you posted.</p><p>QUEST:  I was confused before, I am clear now.</p><p>MELAS:  Great, wonderful.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>MELAS:  Thanks </p><p>QUEST:  Our show has a podcast, it's available from all the main providers.   You can listen at CNN.com/podcast.  </p><p>[16:25:00] Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, all tied with monkey's tales.   One of those tales is now the elephant in the room of Brexit negotiations.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  When Venezuelan President think cryptocurrencies can help  dig the company out of its economic hole.  And Christmas comes once a year,  thankfully.  That music, unfortunately, does not more and more, yes, that  music, you're going to hear a great deal more of, to the point where you're  going to -- </p><p>Before all of that, this is CNN and on this network, the news always comes  first.  </p><p>Houthi rebels have killed the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh.   The Houthi commander says Saleh was killed while fleeing his home in Sanaa.   Sanaa broke with Houthi's two days ago.  We have to turn a page with the  Saudi led coalition that are fighting the rebels.  </p><p>Despite significant progress between Britain and the European Union, they  fail to reach a deal on Brexit at least for now.  The British Prime  Minister, Theresa May and the European Commission President, Jean-Claude  Juncker weren't able to reach an agreement regarding the Irish border, and  several other issues.  The two said they hope to bridge their differences  by week's end.  </p><p>President Trump's endorsing the embattled Republican Senate candidate, Roy  Moore, in the eight days before a special election.  Moore has been accused  of sexually harassing and assaulting women, including minors.  Accusations  he denies.  Despite that, Mr. Trump says Moore is needed in the Senate to  help pass the Republicans massive tax cuts.  </p><p>A new round of wargames is underway in South Korea.  An Air Force official  says U.S. and South Korean fighter jets are carrying out attacks on mock  North Korean missile sites.  North Korean state media says the drills are  creating a situation where, in their words, nuclear war may break out at  any moment.  </p><p>The mayor of Jerusalem has now made a televised appeal to Donald Trump.   Nir Barkat encouraged Mr. Trump to in his words, do the right thing and  recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  He is also urging the  president to bring the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.  </p><p>And news to us at CNN just in, on the president's travel ban.  The U.S.  Supreme Court has granted a request from the government to allow Mr.  Trump's third version of the ban to go into effect pending the appeal.   This is the first time the Supreme Court has allowed any version of the  controversy will ban to go forward in its entirety.  </p><p>[16:30:00] The Turkish president now says he's not considering capital  controls.  It follows reports that President Erdogan had slammed Turkish  business leaders who take money out of the country as traitors.  Now the  president has reiterated Turks must take a national stance.  And again,  allege there are international efforts underway to hurt the Turkish  economy.  The president is fuming after an Iranian/Turkish gold trader on  trial New York, accused the president of helping Iran launder money and  subverting sanctions, which Mr. Erdogan vigorously denies.  In a speech he  hit out at the foreign courts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Some try to  put my country on the trial by being tried themselves in fake courts.   Don't waste your time.  Those fabricated virtual courts and the courts  formed with a made up representatives of that trader faith though can never  convict my country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Soner Cagaptay, is the director of the Turkish Research Program at  the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  Let's begin on the issue of  capital controls.  Do you spot this as being sort of a definitive view on  this, you know, capital controls are not being introduced?</p><p>SONER CAGAPTAY, TURKISH RESEARCH PROGRAM DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR  NEAR EAST POLICY:  Clearly not.  I think that the president, when he made  this comment, then corrected himself today, only a day after, as well as  the deputy Prime Minister, who is a terrific guy -- knows the economy well  -- stepped in to say that the President of Turkey did not at all mean there  would be limits on capital movements.  But I think that was just an  unfortunate comment because despite all the bad news unfortunately coming  out of Turkey, in terms of human rights violations as well as erosion of  democracy, one of Turkey's greatest accomplishments has been that it that  it's a free market economy that provides for a large thriving, prosperous  middle class.  Limitations and restrictions on capital movement will be the  best way to kill that.  So, I'm glad that the President clarified his  comments and walked back from that, </p><p>QUEST:  That is the contradiction of the Turkish situation at the moment.   Isn't it?  Whilst there is widespread condemnation of many of the policies  of President Erdogan -- he obviously, justifies them as being necessary  against the fight against terrorism and dissidents in that sense.  The  economy booms on regardless?  </p><p>CAGAPTAY:  It does because Turkey attracts a lot of -- it used to attract  rather a lot of foreign direct investment in the last decade.  When it  started the accession talks with the European Union.  And now lately it's  been attracting a lot of hot money that comes into Istanbul's stock market.   As well as the fact that there's a pretty large real estate bubble because  of a speculative market that's going on.  And the government itself funds  megaprojects, which not only create employment, of course, creates demand  and builds a support base for the government but also attracts investment.  </p><p>So, I think, it's on the one hand Turkey's economy is a good story.  It's  always a good story.  On the other hand, you're seeing these innate signs  of, I would say, anti-globalism within the government that tries to connect  Turkey's problems to foreign actors.  And I think this remark by the  President that he might limit capital movements is perhaps a symbol of this  two sides of Turkey that you see within the administration and the country.  </p><p>QUEST:  When he talks about national purpose and investors must follow, you  know, obviously what's good for the country, are you seen evidence of  capital flight?  </p><p>CAGAPTAY:  I'm not seeing a lot of it, but I think anecdote is not to put  off data, but I'm hearing a lot of people who are thinking of getting out  of the country.  Especially it wise educated people with many degrees,  speak multiple languages.  And I think that would be unfortunate.  Turkish  President Erdogan, has made Turkey a middle-income economy.  He has lifted  many people out of poverty.  Turkey's main export is now cars.  But you  will become an advanced economy, Turkey has to become a hub for Google.   Meaning it needs to attract talent and keep it.  And Turkey won't get there  if educated Turks are leaving the country.  </p><p>QUEST:  And finally, these accusations that happened in the New York court,  which I read about the president -- the accusation is that President  Erdogan has been helping Iran launder money and subvert U.S. sanctions.  He  talks about phony courts and foreign courts.  Where should we look between  the accusation in the court, and the denial in Turkey?  </p><p>CAGAPTAY:  We have to wait to see the end of the case.  Obviously, this  Turkish/Iranian, dual citizen, businessman, Reza Zarrab, started to say --  confess in the courts that he was part of this sanctions busting scheme.   Which he was running out of Turkish banks, that would be very unfortunate.   It would tarnish Turkey's image.  And it would make a lot of difficulty in  Washington because Turkey is already facing a very difficult period in its  relationship with the United States, and this would add one more pickle to  this very tough period in the relationship.  </p><p>[16:35:04] QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.</p><p>CAGAPTAY:  My pleasure, thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Come back again please.</p><p>In the top story tonight, the Irish border with the U.K. is 500 kilometers  long.  And it's now the crux of the Brexit negotiations.  Take a look at  the map.  You've got, obviously, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland,  Scotland, England and Wales.  But look at that border that goes between  North and South Ireland and that is an open border, the common travel area,  as it's known at the moment.  And there are rumors that the Northern  Ireland could potentially remain aligned with certain EU trade rules, even  after Brexit, in a way to keep that border open.  </p><p>The first minister of Scotland says is a political opportunity.  She hence  that she would want to follow suit, saying, if one part of U.K. can remain  regulatory alignment, there's surely no good practical reason why others  can't.  </p><p>It's an argument picked up by the Mayor of London, who has tweeted similar  support, laying the ground for such a scenario which believes could save  London thousands of jobs.  But for the people of Northern Ireland, it's not  a hypothetical question.  Brexit uncertainties having very real  implications for businesses along the border.  Nic Robertson is along that  border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Below is Middletown, a  tiny, Northern Ireland village nestled against the river that tracks the  Irish border.  It's home to about 300 people.  </p><p>They go to church on Sundays, work hard during the week, and right now,  they feel, well, stuck in the middle in a Brexit tussle.  </p><p>(on camera):  British Prime Minister Theresa May says the U.K. is leaving  the EU customs union and single market, meaning the border on the edge of  Middletown here may get harder to cross.  </p><p>TREVOR MAGILL, MANAGER, MIDDLETOWN POST OFFICE:  The mood always was, this  is a problem, but it would be sorted, and you know, the EU and the  governments would get this sorted.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over):  But now, Trevor McGill, whose family has run the  village post office here for the past 40 years, worries his business and  the village could be harmed.</p><p>MAGILL:  Most of my customers are from this South Ireland, probably 60  percent, 70 percent, and that is the way it helps supports the business for  the for this local area.  </p><p>ROBERTSON:  A few miles away at Linwood's food plant, boss John Woods tells  me his business has boomed since the peace process opened up the border 20  years ago.  His milk comes from the north.  The plastic milk containers  from the south.  He sells on both sides, employs over 300 people.  But if  Brexit brings border controls, all that could change.  </p><p>JOHN WOODS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LINWOODS:  We would just have to abandon  exports to the south on our dairy and on our bakery side.</p><p>The board just runs down the middle of that road.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera):  The middle of the road.</p><p>(voice-over):  It doesn't matter where I look here, people are struggling  to make sense of Brexit.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera):  Tell me when we're crossing over?</p><p>Woods:  Yes, we're crossing over here now.  This is the line.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Fifth generation farmer, Francie Ward, lives just  feet south of the border.  Owns field on both sides.  </p><p>WOODS:  How do you divide it.  </p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera):  Well, that's going to happen in Brexit then.  If  the line is down the middle of the road?  </p><p>WOODS:  I don't know what's going to happen in Brexit </p><p>ROBERTSON:  There are some 310 miles, about 500 kilometers of border, with  between 300 to 400 border crossings.  During Northern Ireland's 30 years of  sectarian violence -- known as the troubles -- many of those crossings like  this one outside Francie Ward's farm were blocked by the police and the  army.</p><p>While few hear fear post Brexit border controls could trigger an immediate  return to the troubles, many like John Woods worry about a possible longer  term economic impact on peace.</p><p>WOODS:  Our success after the troubles has been not only the good work done  by the peacemakers, but also by increasing employment, i.e., lower  unemployment.  Lower unemployment pulls in people who might otherwise see  themselves outside the system.  </p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Like the border, weaving its way betwixt town and  trees, carrying with it a heavy troubled history.  Solution for the current  Brexit impasse seems set to be anything but straight forward and just as  laden with pitfalls.  Nic Robertson, CNN, Middletown, Northern Ireland.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  Philippe Lamberts says certain Brexiteers have a problem  with reality when it comes to border issues, he is the co-president of the  Greens and EFA group at the European Parliament joins me now from Brussels.</p><p>Good to see you, sir, thank you, we were just saying, while we were  listening to Nic's report, there's no easy or obvious solution that  comports to the positions taken by both sides, I mean, a hard border and  you can't have an open border, but the British may say well we'll let goods  go cross, but people can't go across so what is the answer?  </p><p>PHILIPPE LAMBERTS, CO-PRESIDENT OF THE GREENS, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Well,  on the one hand, the United Kingdom government said, OK, we are getting out  of the single market and the customs union then you have Northern Ireland  saying we are sticking with the United Kingdom.  And if you want to keep  the good Friday agreement, you can have no border, so something has to  give, the easy way out would be for the U.K. to reconsider and say that  after all, it will stay in the single market and customs union, but that of  course would a U-turn for the government I mean -- </p><p>QUEST:  Well, you said, with respect, you say the easy thing is for the  British to give in, but it's just as easy for the Irish or the EU side to  say, OK, we'll accept that Ireland remains a special case, that border can  remain open, but the U.K., but Northern Ireland is still not part of the  customs union, that just happens to be a special case and we'll just let it  be as it is.</p><p>LAMBERTS:  That cannot be because if you are regulatory divergence between  north and south, that creates a border de facto because you need to check  the goods and services that go over the border and people wherever they fit  the conditions.  That is the nature of democracy.  So, something has to  give.</p><p>QUEST:  You could check people coming across but not check goods and  services, or you could check goods but say that which goes across that  particular border is tariff or trade free, I mean there are imaginative  ways, you are painting that there's only one solution which is that the  British give way, the British are saying, no, the EU could give way.</p><p>LAMBERTS:  No, I just want to get back to square one.  Brexit created this  contradiction when the referendum was passed, the interpretation that  Theresa May gave to that referendum and she was not obliged to take that  conclusion, is that out of a single market, out of the customs union.  I  respect that, but that creates a border, so you have to place that border  someplace, either you place it on the island of Ireland and that isn't  compatible with the good Friday agreement.</p><p>Or you place it in the Irish Sea and that creates a problem for the  Northern Irish Unionists which I understand.  But this is a contradiction  created by the British government in the interpretation of Brexit, and how  can we on the EU side solve it for them?  It's up to them to make up their  minds, what part of reality they want to live in, but they have created  contradictory versions of reality for them.</p><p>QUEST:  If they say, OK, we'll go back to some form of hard border, that  allows certain goods to cross backwards and forwards because that's the  best way to move forward.  He would say that is not acceptable?</p><p>LAMBERTS:  Well, I'm just saying this isn't compatible with the good Friday  agreement which the U.K. signed for, the good Friday agreement was  basically supported by both Republic of the Ireland and the United Kingdom  and that was easy because both were part of the European Union.  Now we  have discovered, or we seem to have discovered that the fact that one of  the two parties leaves the European Union creates a problem.  But welcome  to reality.  I mean the terms of that impossible equation I've been clear  since day one of the negotiations.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you believe they can settle it by week's end as Theresa May and  President Juncker said?  </p><p>LAMBERTS:  Well, again, something will have to give and while I do not see  the European side giving up on the integrity of the single market.  So, we  have to give time to Theresa May to try to sort it out within her own  majority and within the United Kingdom.  If she can find a majority worthy  --</p><p>QUEST:  Why not, sir, why not?  You have spent the last few minutes telling  me that something has to give, why shouldn't the European side give on the  position of the single market, thus allowing some form of halfway house  that the U.K., for the sake of the good Friday agreement, the U.K. can stay  within the single market, but have restrictions on freedom of movement,  surely that's a quid pro quo.</p><p>LAMBERTS:  In those terms we made a proposal to the United Kingdom ahead of  the U.K. referendum, that was not considered enough by the United Kingdom  government and by the United Kingdom citizens, I respect that.  </p><p>[16:45:00] But then again, why is it so that it is not the EU 27 that has  to give in, because it's not the EU 27 that kicked out the United Kingdom,  it's the United Kingdom that decided to leave the European Union, so they  created the problem.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to have you on the program, lovely, thank you </p><p>Now as we continue our program tonight, that music, that music that will  not go away.  But what effect does it have on shoppers?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Breaking news to bring you, the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to  allow the third version of the travel ban to go into effect.  So, the  significance of this means that the ban against the six countries will be  allowed to come into place while the appeal is being heard, correct?  Our  Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue is on the line.</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER:  Right, this is a significant  temporary victory for the government here the Supreme Court has allowed  that third version of the travel ban to go fully into effect, pending  appeal, right?  And it's the first time the Supreme Court Justices have let  any version of the ban go entirely into effect while the lower courts are  considering the merits, and the reason that's significant is that it could  signal that a majority of the Supreme Court Justices think that this  version might eventually pass legal muster, or certainly that some of them  think that this version is different than the other.  </p><p>QUEST:  This is -- if this is the case, do we know how the Supreme Court  voted on this today, is it one of these things where it was just a signed  order?  </p><p>DE VOGUE:  They released the order and they said the government request is  granted and only two of the liberal justices, that's Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, chose to note that they would have  denied the application.  The Supreme Court, everyone doesn't have to know  the dissent but that sure seems like those two are the only ones that have  a problem with this.</p><p>And keep in mind this version, it was released on the September 24 and it  is a more tailored version of the travel ban, and only placed varying  levels of restrictions on foreign nationals from those eight countries.  A  remember the countries were Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria,  Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen, so the government said to the Supreme Court  this version is different.  And it looks like, at least at this very  preliminary level, the Supreme Court decided to side against -- side with  the Trump administration, while the cases still pending.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST:  Good to have you was, thank you, Ariana.  </p><p>You have heard the song \"Silent Night\" but a new survey says most British  shoppers wish Christmas were little more silent.  And when we come back,  oh, that music.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  It is almost unavoidable at this time of the year, every store you  enter, every tried and true Christmas song over and over again hark, is  that jingle bells I hear once more?  A survey in the U.S. and the U.K.  shows only half of shoppers actually enjoy it.  A quarter of British  consumers actively dislike shopping in a winter wonderland, 20 percent of  retail staff say it causes their Christmas spirit to melt away faster that  frosty the snowman.  </p><p>The founder and chief executive of Soundtrack Your Brand, the streaming  service who did the survey, joins us from Stockholm, can this be true, sir?   Can those who work in shops not like their Christmas music?  </p><p>OLA SARS, FOUNDER AND CEO, SOUNDTRACK YOUR BRAND:  Well, Richard, I used to  work in a retail store when I was younger, and I'll tell you this.  It  drove me crazy personally, you would have to spend six, seven days a week,  working on the floor and hearing the same 20 tracks, so I promise you, I am  not shocked from the results of this study, no.  </p><p>QUEST:  This study showed what?  It makes people feel down.  Why does make  them feel down and not uplift them with the Christmas spirit?</p><p>SARS:  Not all people feel down obviously, the problem is that retail  brands or retail in general are just too sloppy in their execution.  You  can have a great Christmas spirit delivered through music, we all know  that, but it can't be too repetitive, it has to be well thought through and  fit with the local market.  For example, here in Stockholm, looking out at  this silent night right now, actually there's a very local catalog of  Christmas music that we like here, there's a broad spectrum of music, it's  just that retailers are not paying attention and not digging into it and  doing a proper job.</p><p>QUEST:  Hark, is that that same piece of music that one hears yet again?   One wonders, though, from the shoppers' point of view themselves, do they  like it, do shoppers enjoy hearing jingle bells for the 14th time?</p><p>SARS:  Shoppers in general if you look at the numbers do appreciate  Christmas and the Christmas spirit, but it's always trying to deliver the  right type of experience in the morning if you walk in, and the right type  in the evening, they do like the Christmas spirit.</p><p>[16:55:00] But if they do hear the same track over and over again, they  will leave the store.  And as we all know, Christmas is critical for retail  and they need to get that sale done, so they need to think about that  repetitiveness for sure.</p><p>QUEST:  A very merry Christmas or whatever you may be celebrating at the  festive season, sir, when it finally comes, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>SARS:  Merry Christmas.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment, the former British Prime Minister John  Major talking about Northern Ireland once rebuked a reporter saying if  there were any easy solutions, don't you think we would have found them by  now?  </p><p>The same could certainly be true for Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May as  they grapple with the final question over what to do over the northern- southern Irish border, the issue is how to maintain the integrity from the  south's point of view, but still have Brexit from the north's point of view  without a hard border.  </p><p>It's not going to be easy make no bones about it but as you heard on this  program tonight, it often seems as if one side wants the British to make  all the concessions, when actually the Europeans could simply say we will  accept U.K. access to the single market under less favorable terms, but  they won't.  Oh, no, because the Europeans firmly believe it has to be all  pillars or no single market.  </p><p>And the British think there has to be Brexit because Brexit means Brexit.   Remember what I said.  There are no easy solutions because if there were,  they would have found them by now, which means that this one is going to be  tricky right until the end.</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York,  whatever you're up to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable.  I will  see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

A rather feeble pathetic sort of gavel there. Which perhaps justified when you look at how the marketed traded throughout the course of the day. We'll give you great analysis on what happened and why. But the day is over. It is Monday, it's December the 4th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, a Brexit break through that blows a pause. Talks in Brussels falter at the last minute. We'll be in Brussels and on Downing Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street gets a big payday from the tax vote. The Dow is at a record, barely and just. And the fall of the \"House of Cards,\" Netflix announces final season without Kevin Spacey.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, tonight, live from the world financial capital, New York City, where I mean business</p><p>Good evening, we start tonight with Brexit and the negotiations that have stalled on the question of the Irish border. The day began with smiles, handshakes and optimism a deal could be reached. That's Jean-Claude, the president of the commission and Teresa May the British Prime Minister. After intense hours of negotiations those hopes were dashed. The PM and the Commissioner warned crucial issues remain unresolved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT: Despite our best efforts and significant progress, we and our teams have made over the past days on the agreement on issues, it was not possible to reach a complete agreement today.</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: And it's clear crucially that we want to move forward together. But on a couple of issues, some differences do remain, which require further negotiation and consultation. And those will continue, but we will reconvene before the end of the week. And I'm also confident that we will conclude this positively.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now the pound sterling tracked the ups and downs of the talks. Look how you see it spiked before lunchtime in Brussels. The word seemingly good reports of a deal being done, and then it came crashing back down as Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announced they had not made sufficient progress.</p><p>So, let's update you with the issues. So, the big question, of course, the dates until the U.K. leaves the EU, 480 days, 1 hour 57 a minutes and 20 seconds. Everybody is obviously obsessed by that. But that really doesn't tell the whole story. Because the actual time to do a deal, then to get it ratified by Parliaments and then to get it ratified by national governments. If some cases it has to be. Means that has actually a lot less time than you would think.</p><p>So, negotiations that had to be resolved before the talks. OK, so the first thing is the sequencing of how things are going to be dealt with. What needs to be dealt with, before you can get from this side of the chart to this side of the chart. And then you got the EU exit bill. So, there's been substantial progress on the EU exit bill. It's believed that Theresa May is going to offer up to 50 billion pounds on the exit bill and that should sort that out.</p><p>You've got the citizens' rights. There the snag has to do with the Court of Justice and who's going to be allowed in and who is not. The one thing that's interesting is the Irish border, because it's the last hurdle and Juncker was confident of an agreement this week. The problem of course is, that everybody had thought it was going to be -- it was sort of the hidden issue that's suddenly come back.</p><p>Now remember, they've got to get through all of this before they can start talking about trade, legal security, and the two-year, three-year, whatever it is transition period. So, we're still firmly still stuck here. And the European counsel, which is December 14, that's when the British were hoping to get the green light to start moving from this to that side. Keep an eye on this Irish border question, it's the one that's sticking at the moment. We're covering it from both sides of the English Channel. Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels and Bianca Nobilo is in London. Start with you Erin the issue of Northern Ireland and this weird phrase regulatory alignment. What finally caused or what stymied the talks from success today?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well that is certainly the question of today, Richard, it's what people here in Brussels are asking. Here is what we know in terms of how these events unfolded.</p><p>[16:05:00] At the beginning of the day, all signs pointed to there being a deal on the Northern Ireland issue, seen as one of, if not the most contentious issue of these talks. We heard from the Irish Tea Shock saying that a was a deal in place between the EU, the U.K. and Ireland. Then Theresa May arrived she met with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for a working lunch. At some point, according to British and Irish media reports, during that lunch there was a phone call between Prime Minister May and the head of the DUP, Eileen Foster, that had been as a critical --</p><p>QUEST: Let's pause there with that phone call because that phone call takes us across to London, picking up the story, Bianca, what was that phone call about?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN PRODUCER: Well, Arlene Foster who you just mentioned is the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, the DUP. That's the biggest party in Northern Ireland. That's the party that's propping up Theresa May's minority government in the U.K. So, the Prime Minister relies on DUP's support to pass all of her crucial Brexit bills and other government bills of confidence which she needs in order to govern at all.</p><p>QUEST: Stay with you, Bianca. The DUP would not sign up to this deal that was being put together in Brussels. Is that right?</p><p>NOBILO: That is right. The DUP have always been firm on being pro-Brexit and pro-union. That's what they stand for. That they would never countenance the idea of being treated differently from the rest of the U.K. with regards to Brexit. They didn't want to diverge from the rest of the U.K. and be more like the Republic of Ireland. They want to be pro-union and with the rest of the U.K.</p><p>QUEST: Erin, If that is the situation and regulatory alignment is not possible, but they don't -- both sides say they don't want a hard border, what happens next? Could Northern Ireland be the ultimate sticking point?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, it certainly looks that way, Richard. From the EU's perspective, Theresa May needs to sort this out at home and then come back with something along the same lines of the deal that was agreed in Brussels earlier today. That is what the Irish Tea Shock said. He said it's fine if you change the wording, but the meaning has to stay the same. And that's a regulatory alignment essentially, which is according to the draft document that leaked here in Brussels earlier today. Regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland, it has to essentially remain a part of the single market as well as the customs union.</p><p>NOBILO: Richard, I would add as well, that it's not just the DUP that oppose this idea. It's also hard core Brexiteers within the Prime Minister's own government and also within the Labour Party, they don't want to see any difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. either</p><p>QUEST: All right, Brussels, London, thank you, we'll see throughout the course of the week. Time is short in terms of what happened. The impasse in Brussels did not dent European shares. Take a look at the numbers. It's strong gains in Germany and France. Very strong, up 1.5 percent in Germany. The DAX was the driver there. Portugal's finance minister to become the new Euro Group president. That's interesting. Remember the Eurogroup, that's the Eurozone, it deals with matters of the Eurozone, and the Eurogroup, Portugal now taking over.</p><p>The tax vote drove U.S. stocks higher, come and join me, at the trading post. Paul. good to see you.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: We'll be with you in just a moment. Stay comfortable. Guru Paul La Monica will be giving us perspective on a variety of issues.</p><p>The Dow -- only the Dow is at a record. Now bear in mind they sort of hit intraday highs, but fell off late in the session. The Dow was up 300 points at one point, but by the end, it just ekes out a small gain. It's hardly worth -- it's an interesting one here because do we go green in the wall or red in the wall? I think today, we have to go red in the wall. Because we had two of the major markets, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq that were lower, the Nasdaq sizably lower. It is artificial to say that it was a particularly good day just because the Dow gets up over to a record high, even though it does get to a record high and the rotation continues. So, you get at that number -- Paul, would you agree with me, that we perhaps have to call this a down day, even though I know people are getting very excited that the Dow was at a record.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think we do, the Dow, as the name implies, has 30 stocks in it. The S&amp;P has only 500 -- has 500 companies.</p><p>[16:10:00] the Nasdaq has even more. This was a down day. You had a handful of stocks, banks in particular that did go up. But the tax euphoria has already started to fade, because reality is setting in. Now the bills have to be reconciled. That may be easier said than said and done, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Even this morning, the Nasdaq didn't join in the rally, which I don't understand. Because Nasdaq big tech firms like Amazon and Apple stand to gain by those provisions on lower corporate taxes and the repatriation of overseas profits.</p><p>LA MONICA: That is true. I think though that those companies have been beat up all year partly because of all the cash they have and the expectation they might bring it back. Increased dividends, increased buy backs. Their fundamentals are healthy too. But the problem is everyone knows that. Is it a secret that Facebook is one of the best run companies on the planet? Or that Apple and Amazon are? Not at all. The good news here is that the overall market is not falling apart just because tech is starting to slide. And I think there were a lot of people worried. We had gotten so heavy with those big five tech companies. Microsoft was one of the worst performers in the Dow today.</p><p>QUEST: The Fang+ Index, which is what we're going to start looking at more. That's Fang, plus Alibaba --</p><p>LA MONICA: Microsoft, others.</p><p>QUEST: That was down 2.5 percent today.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, there just is this general sense that the easy money, I think, has been made in technology and other areas of the market. Banks, maybe energy stocks, are starting to look a little bit more attractive. And the good news is, we're not seeing as of yet, a fear that the whole market is overvalued, because people are just fleeing sectors, not the entire market.</p><p>QUEST: The -- I can hear the view of being very concerned there. It looks as if -- I mean, is tech taking a break, or is tech taking a beating?</p><p>LA MONICA: I wouldn't go so far as to say they're taking a beating, given that all of these companies are still very, very dominant. Have strong earnings growth expectations, a heck of a lot of cash. Having the pull back that we have seen today with FacebookMicrosoft, Google. It's healthy</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much.</p><p>Now have a listen to this. Now, the first time you hear it, oh, it's lovely makes you swell with holiday cheer and bright. The question is, after you have heard it for the 1,500th time, what happens then?</p><p>QUEST: So, there is the story of the day on Wall Street straight out of the gate, we open at a record. We go higher by 300 points, and it's all because of the potential for a tax cut and taking that. But that evaporated as the day wore on towards the close. And by the close, we are just up .25 of a percentage point at 58 points.</p><p>[16:15:06] Figure it got to nearly 24,290. The Dow was on track for another triple digit gain. And then it just sort of lost steam. Last week the rally was interrupted by the Michael Flynn drama on Friday. Just look at that, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, triple digit gains and you see what happens on Friday. Mr. Trump said the markets will continue their momentum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The stock market I think is going to have a very big day, based on the massive tax cuts that we're very much in the process of getting approved. But based on the vote we had last week, the stock market has been reacting unbelievably well. With the only thing that hurts it is the fake news, and there's plenty of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Stephen Moore helped draft Donald Trump's tax plan during the presidential campaign, he joins me now from Seattle. Good to see you, sir, as always.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST: Hi, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: So, you've got the two competing plans now. You know, the reality is, I was looking at the differences between them. They're not huge. I mean, arguably, the biggest difference is the number of tax brackets, the pass-through rule and the expiration of the individual part -- oh, and the mandate aspect, the health care mandate. Can they be easily reconciled?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, yes, real easily. And look, the Republicans don't want to fail here. They know they can't fail, Richard. So, they're going to get something -- by the way I'm hearing now that it will be Thursday or Friday that they start the reconciliation process between the two bills. Not sure how long that's going to take, but it won't take more than three or four days. So, we should have a vote probably not this week, but next week on the final passage of this.</p><p>One of the big issues of difference is what is going to happened to the small business tax rate. The Senate bill passes -- lowers that rate to about 30 percent, where it's closer to about 35 percent in the House bill. But look, I think the big story is here, that this is pro-growth. You mentioned the stock market, it's really been on a boom now for the last couple of months as investors have become more and more confident that this tax bill is going to happen. Whether it's running a little bit ahead of itself, I can't say. I mean, there's a lot of exuberance out here. But the real question is, is this going to translate into real gains for the economy next year. And I'm on the side that says that it will. That we're going to see a good 2018 as a result of these were reduced tax rates.</p><p>QUEST: But Stephen, the issue of the longer-term deficit, when you have the Senate scoring says that the deficit goes up by over a trillion, and you want to assume that -- the people who come up with that score are as familiar with the economic argument of trickle down as anybody else. Now I know they don't include that directly. They don t account for the actual economic increase. Do you honestly believe that the increased economic taxation will make up the deficit of a trillion?</p><p>MOORE: Well, that's a great question. First of all, the number one job that Donald Trump has is to get the economy moving again. We have been in a 10-year ditch in the American economy. We haven't grown by more than 2 percent for ten years. The reason the debt grew so rapidly under Bush and under Obama, was the economy just underperformed. That, Richard, you cannot -- I've looked at these numbers sideways, upside down, any way you look at them, you're not going to make any progress in terms of reducing our debt until you get the economy moving. Now, Trump has done that big time. I mean, we're up to 3 to 3.5 percent already. That's up from 1.5 percent in Obama's last year. That's a big, big increase. And I think we can keep that growth going. And I would make the case -- if you get the economy moving faster at a sustained level, that debt burden is going to fall. I'm not saying that those tax cuts are going to pay for themselves, I'm saying our ability to absorb the debt is much easier to, you know, to pay off if you've got a growing in prosperous economy.</p><p>QUEST: I am confused in my weekend reading -- in my weekend reading I am confused because --</p><p>MOORE: I thought you said weakened reading -- weekend reading.</p><p>QUEST: On the one hand, you know, I read that the growth cannot be attributed to the president, it is the hangover legacy of eight years of Yellen and Obama and the way in which they constructed the recovery. On the other hand, I have the president tell us at every turn it's all about him. He's only been in office for six months, or nine months, ten months. This can't really be his recovery?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, sure it is. I think it's irrefutable that it is. And the evidence of that is look what happened to the stock market the day after the election where the stocks went up by 700 points.</p><p>[16:20:00] That wasn't a coincidence. We have a pro-business president right now. There's no question about it. Obama was anti-business. This is a president that who is pro-business. Some people think he's too pro- business, but there is no question, the reduction in the regulation. The anticipation of this tax cut has had a big effect. Now, Richard, you are a smart guy, you are smart economic analyst. There's no way you can look at an economy that was slowing down in 2016, we only had 1.5 percent growth in the year 2016. And then you see this curve go straight up after the Trump election. There's a Trump effect here, it's not just a Trump bounce. I think it's a Trump moon bounce and I anticipate it to continue into 2018- 2019</p><p>QUEST: Stephen, when your next time you're in New York, we've got a seat for you here. Please come and join me. We'll have a chat.</p><p>MOORE: I would love to. Love your show.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you Stephen.</p><p>MOORE: Every time I travel abroad, I watch your show.</p><p>QUEST: There we are then. Good, thank you. We like this robust discussion on economics. Which of course, is our part of our conversation. And we'll continue that now with our next guest. A source is telling CNN, Netflix will resume production of the smash hit TV series, \"House of Cards\" without Kevin Spacey as the U.S. president, Frank Underwood. The show's future has been uncertain. There are numerous allegations. You're all familiar with that of miss conduct against the Hollywood star. Chloe is with me. Now hang on, I'm confused. I'm confused a lot tonight. What did we know until today? We knew they were going to try and finish the current series.</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Right, well, no, this is not true, Richard Quest. Let me explain and let me unconfused you if I may. So, \"House of Cards\" suspended production. Netflix, the company behind the show, Media Rights Capital, after the allegations of sexual misconduct on set in my CNN report came forward, they suspended the show, leaving hundreds of people who work on \"House of Cards\" in limbo. They were paying them the hiatus through the break, but their lives, their future, they show, fans at home, nobody knew.</p><p>QUEST: So, they suspended production to be shown when?</p><p>MELAS: They just suspended production of season six. They were in the middle of filming season six which was set to premier in 2018.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So now what are they going to do with season six?</p><p>MELAS: They're going to start filming again. And they're going to start filming after the new year. And so, that means that hundreds of people have jobs. They can feed their families through Christmas and the holidays. This is a joyous occasion for the people who have spent so many seasons telling the \"House of Cards\" stories. But it's been crazy, I can tell you, speaking to sources, for the writers. Having to rewrite this that they spent months writing season six. And then they had to rewrite it in just a few weeks, so it's been a scramble writing out Kevin Spacey's character --</p><p>QUEST: Without him -- I mean, it's now you see me, now you don't.</p><p>MELAS: Right.</p><p>QUEST: One episode he's there. Next episode he's not going to be there. And it's how you going to get rid of him between the two.</p><p>MELAS: Well, exactly. Now in the original series that this show is based on they kill off Kevin Spacey's character. So, there's a chance that Kevin Spacey will be killed off in the first episode, or were not exactly sure how the writers are going to frame it. But he will not be on anymore.</p><p>QUEST: Well, they've got to kill him off.</p><p>MELAS: Yes. We're not sure, maybe he goes away on a long-extended vacation somewhere. Rides off into the sunset.</p><p>QUEST: I have a year or two on you, and so I'm old enough to remember Dallas. I think it was Bobby Ewing, who came back after several months of being in a sleep coma. We thought he was going to be truly killed off, so they managed to bring him back. So, they're going to get rid of him.</p><p>MELAS: Right.</p><p>QUEST: And this is the end of season six.</p><p>MELAS: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: What happens after that?</p><p>MELAS: We're not sure if the show -- the show is definitely not going to continue at all. So, Netflix had said that season six would be its last season.</p><p>QUEST: And that's still the case?</p><p>MELAS: This is still the case, and Richard, I can tell you though, we have been waiting for a response from Kevin Spacey. You know, his team really no longer exists, because everybody has dropped him in the wake of these allegations, with the exception of his attorney. You know, we don't know where he is. We think that perhaps he might still be in rehab, which is the last we heard about a month ago. So, we haven't heard from him, his thoughts on being ousted from this show that he's been a part of since the beginning.</p><p>QUEST: One can certainly say though that the audience for that particular episode, between the before and the after, will be fairly humongous, and trying to keep a secret of what they've done with him is going to be very difficult?</p><p>MELAS: It's going to be difficult especially when you have reporters like myself who are always trying to break the scoop, so. I'll tell you, I'll keep you posted.</p><p>QUEST: I was confused before, I am clear now.</p><p>MELAS: Great, wonderful.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MELAS: Thanks</p><p>QUEST: Our show has a podcast, it's available from all the main providers. You can listen at CNN.com/podcast.</p><p>[16:25:00] Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, all tied with monkey's tales. One of those tales is now the elephant in the room of Brexit negotiations.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. When Venezuelan President think cryptocurrencies can help dig the company out of its economic hole. And Christmas comes once a year, thankfully. That music, unfortunately, does not more and more, yes, that music, you're going to hear a great deal more of, to the point where you're going to --</p><p>Before all of that, this is CNN and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>Houthi rebels have killed the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Houthi commander says Saleh was killed while fleeing his home in Sanaa. Sanaa broke with Houthi's two days ago. We have to turn a page with the Saudi led coalition that are fighting the rebels.</p><p>Despite significant progress between Britain and the European Union, they fail to reach a deal on Brexit at least for now. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May and the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker weren't able to reach an agreement regarding the Irish border, and several other issues. The two said they hope to bridge their differences by week's end.</p><p>President Trump's endorsing the embattled Republican Senate candidate, Roy Moore, in the eight days before a special election. Moore has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting women, including minors. Accusations he denies. Despite that, Mr. Trump says Moore is needed in the Senate to help pass the Republicans massive tax cuts.</p><p>A new round of wargames is underway in South Korea. An Air Force official says U.S. and South Korean fighter jets are carrying out attacks on mock North Korean missile sites. North Korean state media says the drills are creating a situation where, in their words, nuclear war may break out at any moment.</p><p>The mayor of Jerusalem has now made a televised appeal to Donald Trump. Nir Barkat encouraged Mr. Trump to in his words, do the right thing and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He is also urging the president to bring the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p>And news to us at CNN just in, on the president's travel ban. The U.S. Supreme Court has granted a request from the government to allow Mr. Trump's third version of the ban to go into effect pending the appeal. This is the first time the Supreme Court has allowed any version of the controversy will ban to go forward in its entirety.</p><p>[16:30:00] The Turkish president now says he's not considering capital controls. It follows reports that President Erdogan had slammed Turkish business leaders who take money out of the country as traitors. Now the president has reiterated Turks must take a national stance. And again, allege there are international efforts underway to hurt the Turkish economy. The president is fuming after an Iranian/Turkish gold trader on trial New York, accused the president of helping Iran launder money and subverting sanctions, which Mr. Erdogan vigorously denies. In a speech he hit out at the foreign courts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): Some try to put my country on the trial by being tried themselves in fake courts. Don't waste your time. Those fabricated virtual courts and the courts formed with a made up representatives of that trader faith though can never convict my country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Soner Cagaptay, is the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Let's begin on the issue of capital controls. Do you spot this as being sort of a definitive view on this, you know, capital controls are not being introduced?</p><p>SONER CAGAPTAY, TURKISH RESEARCH PROGRAM DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY: Clearly not. I think that the president, when he made this comment, then corrected himself today, only a day after, as well as the deputy Prime Minister, who is a terrific guy -- knows the economy well -- stepped in to say that the President of Turkey did not at all mean there would be limits on capital movements. But I think that was just an unfortunate comment because despite all the bad news unfortunately coming out of Turkey, in terms of human rights violations as well as erosion of democracy, one of Turkey's greatest accomplishments has been that it that it's a free market economy that provides for a large thriving, prosperous middle class. Limitations and restrictions on capital movement will be the best way to kill that. So, I'm glad that the President clarified his comments and walked back from that,</p><p>QUEST: That is the contradiction of the Turkish situation at the moment. Isn't it? Whilst there is widespread condemnation of many of the policies of President Erdogan -- he obviously, justifies them as being necessary against the fight against terrorism and dissidents in that sense. The economy booms on regardless?</p><p>CAGAPTAY: It does because Turkey attracts a lot of -- it used to attract rather a lot of foreign direct investment in the last decade. When it started the accession talks with the European Union. And now lately it's been attracting a lot of hot money that comes into Istanbul's stock market. As well as the fact that there's a pretty large real estate bubble because of a speculative market that's going on. And the government itself funds megaprojects, which not only create employment, of course, creates demand and builds a support base for the government but also attracts investment.</p><p>So, I think, it's on the one hand Turkey's economy is a good story. It's always a good story. On the other hand, you're seeing these innate signs of, I would say, anti-globalism within the government that tries to connect Turkey's problems to foreign actors. And I think this remark by the President that he might limit capital movements is perhaps a symbol of this two sides of Turkey that you see within the administration and the country.</p><p>QUEST: When he talks about national purpose and investors must follow, you know, obviously what's good for the country, are you seen evidence of capital flight?</p><p>CAGAPTAY: I'm not seeing a lot of it, but I think anecdote is not to put off data, but I'm hearing a lot of people who are thinking of getting out of the country. Especially it wise educated people with many degrees, speak multiple languages. And I think that would be unfortunate. Turkish President Erdogan, has made Turkey a middle-income economy. He has lifted many people out of poverty. Turkey's main export is now cars. But you will become an advanced economy, Turkey has to become a hub for Google. Meaning it needs to attract talent and keep it. And Turkey won't get there if educated Turks are leaving the country.</p><p>QUEST: And finally, these accusations that happened in the New York court, which I read about the president -- the accusation is that President Erdogan has been helping Iran launder money and subvert U.S. sanctions. He talks about phony courts and foreign courts. Where should we look between the accusation in the court, and the denial in Turkey?</p><p>CAGAPTAY: We have to wait to see the end of the case. Obviously, this Turkish/Iranian, dual citizen, businessman, Reza Zarrab, started to say -- confess in the courts that he was part of this sanctions busting scheme. Which he was running out of Turkish banks, that would be very unfortunate. It would tarnish Turkey's image. And it would make a lot of difficulty in Washington because Turkey is already facing a very difficult period in its relationship with the United States, and this would add one more pickle to this very tough period in the relationship.</p><p>[16:35:04] QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you.</p><p>CAGAPTAY: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Come back again please.</p><p>In the top story tonight, the Irish border with the U.K. is 500 kilometers long. And it's now the crux of the Brexit negotiations. Take a look at the map. You've got, obviously, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. But look at that border that goes between North and South Ireland and that is an open border, the common travel area, as it's known at the moment. And there are rumors that the Northern Ireland could potentially remain aligned with certain EU trade rules, even after Brexit, in a way to keep that border open.</p><p>The first minister of Scotland says is a political opportunity. She hence that she would want to follow suit, saying, if one part of U.K. can remain regulatory alignment, there's surely no good practical reason why others can't.</p><p>It's an argument picked up by the Mayor of London, who has tweeted similar support, laying the ground for such a scenario which believes could save London thousands of jobs. But for the people of Northern Ireland, it's not a hypothetical question. Brexit uncertainties having very real implications for businesses along the border. Nic Robertson is along that border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Below is Middletown, a tiny, Northern Ireland village nestled against the river that tracks the Irish border. It's home to about 300 people.</p><p>They go to church on Sundays, work hard during the week, and right now, they feel, well, stuck in the middle in a Brexit tussle.</p><p>(on camera): British Prime Minister Theresa May says the U.K. is leaving the EU customs union and single market, meaning the border on the edge of Middletown here may get harder to cross.</p><p>TREVOR MAGILL, MANAGER, MIDDLETOWN POST OFFICE: The mood always was, this is a problem, but it would be sorted, and you know, the EU and the governments would get this sorted.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): But now, Trevor McGill, whose family has run the village post office here for the past 40 years, worries his business and the village could be harmed.</p><p>MAGILL: Most of my customers are from this South Ireland, probably 60 percent, 70 percent, and that is the way it helps supports the business for the for this local area.</p><p>ROBERTSON: A few miles away at Linwood's food plant, boss John Woods tells me his business has boomed since the peace process opened up the border 20 years ago. His milk comes from the north. The plastic milk containers from the south. He sells on both sides, employs over 300 people. But if Brexit brings border controls, all that could change.</p><p>JOHN WOODS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LINWOODS: We would just have to abandon exports to the south on our dairy and on our bakery side.</p><p>The board just runs down the middle of that road.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): The middle of the road.</p><p>(voice-over): It doesn't matter where I look here, people are struggling to make sense of Brexit.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): Tell me when we're crossing over?</p><p>Woods: Yes, we're crossing over here now. This is the line.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Fifth generation farmer, Francie Ward, lives just feet south of the border. Owns field on both sides.</p><p>WOODS: How do you divide it.</p><p>ROBERTSON (on camera): Well, that's going to happen in Brexit then. If the line is down the middle of the road?</p><p>WOODS: I don't know what's going to happen in Brexit</p><p>ROBERTSON: There are some 310 miles, about 500 kilometers of border, with between 300 to 400 border crossings. During Northern Ireland's 30 years of sectarian violence -- known as the troubles -- many of those crossings like this one outside Francie Ward's farm were blocked by the police and the army.</p><p>While few hear fear post Brexit border controls could trigger an immediate return to the troubles, many like John Woods worry about a possible longer term economic impact on peace.</p><p>WOODS: Our success after the troubles has been not only the good work done by the peacemakers, but also by increasing employment, i.e., lower unemployment. Lower unemployment pulls in people who might otherwise see themselves outside the system.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Like the border, weaving its way betwixt town and trees, carrying with it a heavy troubled history. Solution for the current Brexit impasse seems set to be anything but straight forward and just as laden with pitfalls. Nic Robertson, CNN, Middletown, Northern Ireland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST: Philippe Lamberts says certain Brexiteers have a problem with reality when it comes to border issues, he is the co-president of the Greens and EFA group at the European Parliament joins me now from Brussels.</p><p>Good to see you, sir, thank you, we were just saying, while we were listening to Nic's report, there's no easy or obvious solution that comports to the positions taken by both sides, I mean, a hard border and you can't have an open border, but the British may say well we'll let goods go cross, but people can't go across so what is the answer?</p><p>PHILIPPE LAMBERTS, CO-PRESIDENT OF THE GREENS, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Well, on the one hand, the United Kingdom government said, OK, we are getting out of the single market and the customs union then you have Northern Ireland saying we are sticking with the United Kingdom. And if you want to keep the good Friday agreement, you can have no border, so something has to give, the easy way out would be for the U.K. to reconsider and say that after all, it will stay in the single market and customs union, but that of course would a U-turn for the government I mean --</p><p>QUEST: Well, you said, with respect, you say the easy thing is for the British to give in, but it's just as easy for the Irish or the EU side to say, OK, we'll accept that Ireland remains a special case, that border can remain open, but the U.K., but Northern Ireland is still not part of the customs union, that just happens to be a special case and we'll just let it be as it is.</p><p>LAMBERTS: That cannot be because if you are regulatory divergence between north and south, that creates a border de facto because you need to check the goods and services that go over the border and people wherever they fit the conditions. That is the nature of democracy. So, something has to give.</p><p>QUEST: You could check people coming across but not check goods and services, or you could check goods but say that which goes across that particular border is tariff or trade free, I mean there are imaginative ways, you are painting that there's only one solution which is that the British give way, the British are saying, no, the EU could give way.</p><p>LAMBERTS: No, I just want to get back to square one. Brexit created this contradiction when the referendum was passed, the interpretation that Theresa May gave to that referendum and she was not obliged to take that conclusion, is that out of a single market, out of the customs union. I respect that, but that creates a border, so you have to place that border someplace, either you place it on the island of Ireland and that isn't compatible with the good Friday agreement.</p><p>Or you place it in the Irish Sea and that creates a problem for the Northern Irish Unionists which I understand. But this is a contradiction created by the British government in the interpretation of Brexit, and how can we on the EU side solve it for them? It's up to them to make up their minds, what part of reality they want to live in, but they have created contradictory versions of reality for them.</p><p>QUEST: If they say, OK, we'll go back to some form of hard border, that allows certain goods to cross backwards and forwards because that's the best way to move forward. He would say that is not acceptable?</p><p>LAMBERTS: Well, I'm just saying this isn't compatible with the good Friday agreement which the U.K. signed for, the good Friday agreement was basically supported by both Republic of the Ireland and the United Kingdom and that was easy because both were part of the European Union. Now we have discovered, or we seem to have discovered that the fact that one of the two parties leaves the European Union creates a problem. But welcome to reality. I mean the terms of that impossible equation I've been clear since day one of the negotiations.</p><p>QUEST: Do you believe they can settle it by week's end as Theresa May and President Juncker said?</p><p>LAMBERTS: Well, again, something will have to give and while I do not see the European side giving up on the integrity of the single market. So, we have to give time to Theresa May to try to sort it out within her own majority and within the United Kingdom. If she can find a majority worthy --</p><p>QUEST: Why not, sir, why not? You have spent the last few minutes telling me that something has to give, why shouldn't the European side give on the position of the single market, thus allowing some form of halfway house that the U.K., for the sake of the good Friday agreement, the U.K. can stay within the single market, but have restrictions on freedom of movement, surely that's a quid pro quo.</p><p>LAMBERTS: In those terms we made a proposal to the United Kingdom ahead of the U.K. referendum, that was not considered enough by the United Kingdom government and by the United Kingdom citizens, I respect that.</p><p>[16:45:00] But then again, why is it so that it is not the EU 27 that has to give in, because it's not the EU 27 that kicked out the United Kingdom, it's the United Kingdom that decided to leave the European Union, so they created the problem.</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you on the program, lovely, thank you</p><p>Now as we continue our program tonight, that music, that music that will not go away. But what effect does it have on shoppers?</p><p>QUEST: Breaking news to bring you, the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to allow the third version of the travel ban to go into effect. So, the significance of this means that the ban against the six countries will be allowed to come into place while the appeal is being heard, correct? Our Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue is on the line.</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER: Right, this is a significant temporary victory for the government here the Supreme Court has allowed that third version of the travel ban to go fully into effect, pending appeal, right? And it's the first time the Supreme Court Justices have let any version of the ban go entirely into effect while the lower courts are considering the merits, and the reason that's significant is that it could signal that a majority of the Supreme Court Justices think that this version might eventually pass legal muster, or certainly that some of them think that this version is different than the other.</p><p>QUEST: This is -- if this is the case, do we know how the Supreme Court voted on this today, is it one of these things where it was just a signed order?</p><p>DE VOGUE: They released the order and they said the government request is granted and only two of the liberal justices, that's Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, chose to note that they would have denied the application. The Supreme Court, everyone doesn't have to know the dissent but that sure seems like those two are the only ones that have a problem with this.</p><p>And keep in mind this version, it was released on the September 24 and it is a more tailored version of the travel ban, and only placed varying levels of restrictions on foreign nationals from those eight countries. A remember the countries were Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen, so the government said to the Supreme Court this version is different. And it looks like, at least at this very preliminary level, the Supreme Court decided to side against -- side with the Trump administration, while the cases still pending.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST: Good to have you was, thank you, Ariana.</p><p>You have heard the song \"Silent Night\" but a new survey says most British shoppers wish Christmas were little more silent. And when we come back, oh, that music.</p><p>QUEST: It is almost unavoidable at this time of the year, every store you enter, every tried and true Christmas song over and over again hark, is that jingle bells I hear once more? A survey in the U.S. and the U.K. shows only half of shoppers actually enjoy it. A quarter of British consumers actively dislike shopping in a winter wonderland, 20 percent of retail staff say it causes their Christmas spirit to melt away faster that frosty the snowman.</p><p>The founder and chief executive of Soundtrack Your Brand, the streaming service who did the survey, joins us from Stockholm, can this be true, sir? Can those who work in shops not like their Christmas music?</p><p>OLA SARS, FOUNDER AND CEO, SOUNDTRACK YOUR BRAND: Well, Richard, I used to work in a retail store when I was younger, and I'll tell you this. It drove me crazy personally, you would have to spend six, seven days a week, working on the floor and hearing the same 20 tracks, so I promise you, I am not shocked from the results of this study, no.</p><p>QUEST: This study showed what? It makes people feel down. Why does make them feel down and not uplift them with the Christmas spirit?</p><p>SARS: Not all people feel down obviously, the problem is that retail brands or retail in general are just too sloppy in their execution. You can have a great Christmas spirit delivered through music, we all know that, but it can't be too repetitive, it has to be well thought through and fit with the local market. For example, here in Stockholm, looking out at this silent night right now, actually there's a very local catalog of Christmas music that we like here, there's a broad spectrum of music, it's just that retailers are not paying attention and not digging into it and doing a proper job.</p><p>QUEST: Hark, is that that same piece of music that one hears yet again? One wonders, though, from the shoppers' point of view themselves, do they like it, do shoppers enjoy hearing jingle bells for the 14th time?</p><p>SARS: Shoppers in general if you look at the numbers do appreciate Christmas and the Christmas spirit, but it's always trying to deliver the right type of experience in the morning if you walk in, and the right type in the evening, they do like the Christmas spirit.</p><p>[16:55:00] But if they do hear the same track over and over again, they will leave the store. And as we all know, Christmas is critical for retail and they need to get that sale done, so they need to think about that repetitiveness for sure.</p><p>QUEST: A very merry Christmas or whatever you may be celebrating at the festive season, sir, when it finally comes, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>SARS: Merry Christmas.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment, the former British Prime Minister John Major talking about Northern Ireland once rebuked a reporter saying if there were any easy solutions, don't you think we would have found them by now?</p><p>The same could certainly be true for Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May as they grapple with the final question over what to do over the northern- southern Irish border, the issue is how to maintain the integrity from the south's point of view, but still have Brexit from the north's point of view without a hard border.</p><p>It's not going to be easy make no bones about it but as you heard on this program tonight, it often seems as if one side wants the British to make all the concessions, when actually the Europeans could simply say we will accept U.K. access to the single market under less favorable terms, but they won't. Oh, no, because the Europeans firmly believe it has to be all pillars or no single market.</p><p>And the British think there has to be Brexit because Brexit means Brexit. Remember what I said. There are no easy solutions because if there were, they would have found them by now, which means that this one is going to be tricky right until the end.</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever you're up to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable. I will see you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017120401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R3T-SKK1-DXH2-6061-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 4, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

We've covered most of the Brexit issues presented here, but this is a very useful high-level take that could be helpful as a recap of the state of play for curious friends and colleagues. By Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. Originally published at openDemocracy[1] The fallout of coronavirus only adds to Britain's problems as the country tries to extricate itself from 40 years of EU membership. </p><p>We already know that Boris Johnson, rather than taking the easy route and remaining part of institutions which can ensure air travel safety or facilitate approval of new medicines - at least until such institutions can be created anew in the UK - is risking the most extreme version of Brexit imaginable. Even British membership of the European Convention on Human Rights, has been thrown into doubt by Johnson's team, an institution which has nothing to do with the EU, and in fact includes Russia and Turkey. Johnson has said he wants a 'Canada style' trade deal with the EU, but he wants such a shallow relationship with the EU that he will accept a no deal Brexit (now referred to as an 'Australian option') if that falls through. By the government's own reckoning this would wipe between 5% off the UK economy in the government's best case scenario, and up to 9% in the event of no deal. Not content with negotiating one immense deal this year, Johnson has set himself a second mammoth objective - a trade deal with the USA. Some suggest that this is a negotiating ploy - to play off the world's two biggest trading blocks against one another in their desire for a deal with Britain. Sinn Fein pointed out the 'glaring contradictions' in 'publishing their objectives for parallel talks with the US'. They're right in that it isn't possible to do deep trade deals with both the EU and US - let alone in a year. That's because modern trade deals are less about the tariff reductions most people associate with 'free trade', and far more to do with how a government regulates its economy. EU and US regulations are very different, and as a relatively small country, broadly speaking, Britain needs to decide which system it will adopt, which block it wants to be closer to. If this is all a negotiating ploy, Johnson has massively overplayed his hand. The EU would love a deal with the UK, but it cannot breach fundamental principles of the block, and neither can it offer Britain significantly better terms than it would any other third country. If Britain moves towards the US 'market know best' economic model, the EU will only be able to offer the lightest of trade deals. On the other side, Trump's real interest in a trade deal with Britain is precisely to weaken and thumb his nose at the EU, which he sees as America's main trade competitor. For him, unless Britain accepts the US regulatory model, a trade deal is of no interest to him, something his negotiators have said clearly in the papers from the preliminary trade talks leaked before Christmas. So it's a choice. And from what we've seen to date, Johnson has already made up his mind which path he prefers. Never before in history must trade talks have begun amid the levels of distrust and hostility that currently exist between Britain and the EU. Speeches by Johnson and his lead negotiator David Frost went out of their way to irritate European negotiators. Far from the normal warm words, Frost's speech was a lament to an outdated vision of national sovereignty in which he quoted extensively from Edmund Burke and seemed to imply the EU was the ultimate toxic outgrowth of the French Revolution. The British approach to Trump has been quite different, although even here Johnson seems to have underestimated just how difficult an operator Trump is. His decision to adopt Huwei technology led to a temporary breakdown in relations between the two sides, and civil servants were said to be aghast at the level of Trump's anger. But that aside, Johnson clearly favours the transatlantic relationship. And this shouldn't surprise us. After all, a central driver for Brexit for a section of Britain's ruling class has always been that the EU is an over-regulated bureaucratic nightmare akin to a communist dictatorship. Brexit, for them, represented a desire to break free from Europe, slash regulations and become a free market US proxy floating in the North Atlantic. A trade deal is a key mechanism for locking in this right-wing dream, and for fundamentally and irreversibly shifting power away from ordinary people and towards international capital. That's precisely because trade deals today are really about so much more than 'trade'. Indeed in many ways trade rules are the fundamental laws of the global economy. And unlike international agreements on human rights or climate changes, they are highly enforceable. By their nature, they're largely written behind closed doors, especially in post-Brexit Britain where we have no accountability mechanisms. MPs have no rights to vote on the government's objectives, no ability to properly scrutinise the negotiations, and can't even stop a trade deal when it's been agreed. Ironically, while our potential trade deal with the EU would have to be passed through the European Council and the European Parliament, and in all likelihood member state parliaments and even regional assemblies in Belgium, our MPs will have no power over that deal. 'Science-Based' Chlorine Chicken Chlorine chicken has become a symbol of a US trade deal, and this isn't as frivolous as it might sound. Rather these poor birds are a great symbol of the downward pressure which modern trade deals exert on our hard-fought for rights, standards and protections. How does it work? Imagine I'm a chicken farmer in the US. I think my chicken is just as good and just as safe as British chicken, but I farm it in a different way. I see British food standards, which don't allow me to wash my chicken in chemicals like chlorine, as simply a form of trade protectionism. So I lobby my government to ensure that in the trade deal my chicken is seen as 'equivalent' to British chicken, and can enter the British market even though it's made in ways not allowed here. This might be acceptable if the chicken genuinely was the same. But US food standards are radically different to those practiced in Britain. US agriculture is dominated by massive corporations, farming animals on an industrial scale, with intensive use of antibiotics, hormones and steroids to promote rapid growth and prevent illness in what are often extremely unpleasant and unhealthy conditions. It isn't the chlorine that's the problem per se, more that it conceals a non-existent animal welfare system. Chicken is just an example. Across the board, big business has subverted the US system of consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental sustainability. Small farmers have been decimated by this system. Astonishingly, it's a model that has become known as 'science-based', in contrast to the 'precautionary based' model practiced here, which takes a cautious approach to health risks and bans foods where there's a substantial and credible risk to health. A good example of what this means in practice is that lead-based paint, banned in most of Europe before the Second World War, was not prohibited in the US until 1978. Worryingly, Johnson has endorsed this 'science-based' approach. Food standards here will change. And farmers, unable to compete against the lower standard food being imported here, will have to themselves push for lower standards. This is how trade deals exert downward pressure on regulations. Regulations aren't the end of it. There's been much talk of the NHS in relation to US trade talks. Is it on the table? In a word, yes. This doesn't mean a US multinational will come over and buy up the NHS lock, stock and barrel. It means that modern trade deals embed the liberalisation of services across the board. For the NHS, this means locking in and 'ratcheting up' (an actual trade term) liberalisation. Renationalising privatised services can become nearly impossible. Medicine prices are a core element of many trade deals which extend the monopoly power of big pharmaceutical corporations. Already so bloated as to be dysfunctional, as we've seen in the current Coronavirus crisis, modern trade deals give Big Pharma longer patent terms, make them easier to extend and keep their research secret, making medical collaboration impossible. And Big Pharma isn't alone. Increasingly trade deals give similar privileges to Big Tech companies, and even incorporate special 'corporate courts' which allow foreign investors to sue governments for any policy they don't like. In one recent case an energy multinational took action against the Netherlands in one of these 'courts' for daring to announce a phase out of coal power. As far as the US government is concerned, this is all 'on the table' - it's there in black and white in their own mandate or in the leaked version of those censored trade papers[2] which Jeremy Corbyn held up during the general election.
