That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p> Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p> The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p> Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p> Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p> That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p> In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p> And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p> Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p> And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p> All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p> KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p> By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p> But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p> That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p> This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p> The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p> So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p> What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p> Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p> So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p> Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p> But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p> I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p> And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p> So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p> Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p> As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p> So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p> Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p> Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p> So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p> So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p> I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p> They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p> We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p> And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p> A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p> But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p> So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p> Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p> In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p> Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p> Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p> Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p> But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p> KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p> I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p> ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p> ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p> ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p> ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p> And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p> And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p> They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p> Joining us now is --</p><p> SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p> What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p> This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p> So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p> Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p> 401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p> And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p> And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p> So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p> And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p> MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p> Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p> ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p> If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p> XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p> Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p> The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p> GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p> The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p> A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p> PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p> Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p> The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p> If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p> And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p> But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p> THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p> There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p> We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p> Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p> And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p> Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p> MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p> TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p> JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p> TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.  Still ahead, \"Hercules\" star Kevin Sorbo here.  His take on  the Harvey Weinstein scandal, harassment in Hollywood and his new movie,  that is next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p>Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p>And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p>TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.  Still ahead, \"Hercules\" star Kevin Sorbo here.  His take on  the Harvey Weinstein scandal, harassment in Hollywood and his new movie,  that is next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p>Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p>ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p>And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p>RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p>THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p>TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\"  We now turn  it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning.   \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Back at you Cheryl.  We'll see you in a little  bit.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including  Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning.  This comes after one stellar  afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all  delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p> Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer.   By the way, Google and Microsoft hitting all time highs in the post market.   And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazon gaining wholesale  pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p> The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy  health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p> Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across  the board.  The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment.  This is  after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p> Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy  was growing in the last quarter.  Investors are also eyeing key  developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a  budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I am very, very excited  because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it  strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p> That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been  living under a broken system.  So much time and money is wasted just  complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.  </p><p> In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and  Germany.  We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into  Friday's trading day there.  The CAC Krones in France up more than one  percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well.  Gains in Hong Kong  and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across  the board.  The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p> And the truth is out there but not all of it.  Conspiracy theorist outrage  after the White House continues to keep some JFK's assassination files  under wraps.  The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p> Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X,  the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.  </p><p> And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker  Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out  of the game.  Awful hit.</p><p> All of that coming up this morning and so much.  Joining me all morning  long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle.  Kelly and Company Managing  Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin  Elmore.  Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE:  You as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall.  And I know you are so  fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from  earnings.  We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up  which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER:  I don't --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p> KELLY:  I couldn't sleep last night.  I mean it was just like I was so  excited, there's so much happening.  And the people we have coming on today  to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let's tee that up.  Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of  (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel.  His conversation with Maria.  New York Stock  Exchange president, Tom Farley.  Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board  of Director, Rajeev Misra.  And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new  movie and so much more coming out.  </p><p> By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one  lucky guy.</p><p> But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with  Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the  bell.  </p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour.   And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported  record quarterly revenue.  Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy  business.</p><p> That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual  newspapers.  There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon  has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12  states. </p><p> This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's  third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion.  Kevin, where  do you want to start?  Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal  because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and  given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high.  So we  actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p> The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is  regulation.  We see that they don't even really pay taxes.  When you look  at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single  quarter.</p><p> So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services.  They  continuously dominate in that facet.  The clear number one -- Microsoft is  number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p> What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud.  So  what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually  replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as  on site.</p><p> Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to  compete against Microsoft on that.  And Amazon web services, they  continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p> So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to  see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the  delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics.  Their -- 50 percent of their  sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's  pretty telling.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday.  And by  the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today.  Boo,  there you go, $66 billion offer.  </p><p> Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this  potentially change not just CVS's business?  Because CVS has been moving  toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a  percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their  revenue.  </p><p> But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage  negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal,  more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to  strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p> I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy  like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And the -- yes.  And that's the interesting aspect, right?   CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business.  And then  they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health  insurers.</p><p> And this goes back to drug pricing, right?  We've seen a lot of chatter  about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being.  On drug  pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit  manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p> So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going  to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's fascinating to just think about the  possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that --  because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the  campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p> Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license --  Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And I think one of the things that  we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p> As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that  that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if  Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well Amazon does everything right.  But I sort of feel that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until they don't.  That day is coming, we just don't know when  that might happen.</p><p> ELMORE:  Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in  terms of their retail products.  And now that Amazon is the one that's  getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat  chasing its tail?</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're  trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in  their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales,  right?</p><p> So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales.  What  they're going to do is server replacement on the front page.  So if you're  a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music,  they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at  the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into  these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet,  there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p> Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's  strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there.  And  then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud  computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365  online.</p><p> Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent.   So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Well, there's -- they're broken up differently.  Which  Microsoft --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  Right.  So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually  pay a dividend like that.  Think about how Google doesn't even pay a  dividend, okay?  And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p> So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time  enterprise sales into subscriptions, right?  So for Office 365 you now pay  on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the  latest edition.</p><p> So they're all trying to transition.  And what they do best for all these  companies is they have the best leaderships.  (INAUDIBLE) came out,  Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their  actually core competencies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one  hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for  Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p> I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three  companies.  Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets  moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare  reform is because of these earnings.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, exactly.  Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also  benefited from the weak dollar.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.  So much more to talk about.  I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X  which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p> They were out to five weeks in delivery times.  They don't even start  shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p> We're going to talk about all of that.  Coming up, newly released  government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are  released but there still more questions than answers.  Were the Russians  involved?</p><p> And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you  started your day this morning, you are officially too late.  More on that  ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House delaying the release of some of the JFK  assassination documents sighting national security concerns.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen?  Historians,  conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire  collection.  </p><p> A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year.   But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld.  President  Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had  no choice.</p><p> But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new  details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months  before the shooting.  And get this, the CIA had been involved in  assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p> So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents  I'm sure coming out.  </p><p> Okay.  Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably  going to have trouble getting your hands on one.  Sources say supplies of a  hot new phone already sold out.  Shipping estimates are slipping well  beyond November 3rd launch date.  </p><p> In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months.  The news coming on weak sales  of the iPhone8.  Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest  sales of any of the company's new smartphones.  People are still getting  the 7 basically.  Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p> Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last  night.  Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco.  Kiko  Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet.  A fight ensues after all  this goes down.  Just waiting for the fight.</p><p> Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso.  Now he crushed  Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight.  Flacco would go straight  into the locker room.  He had a concussion, he did not come back to the  game.</p><p> Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these  days.  A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is  dropping.  Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now  but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p> Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase.  Fans are  also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national  anthem.  Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate.  That's up  from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent  who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p> But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel  during the national anthem at a football game.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Kevin, so we see the favorability  ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that  much.  They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but  they're not down that much.</p><p> KELLY:  No, it's not.  And I mean there's so much business and  entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it  come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that  revolves around it.</p><p> I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right?  I mean it's  such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh,  Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p> ELMORE:  Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not anymore.  I'm tired because you see all the commercials  beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday.  He said,  \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday.  I'll just  relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's funny.  </p><p> ELMORE:  I love it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts,  you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks  and ultimately it trickles down.  So that's the way you do it.</p><p> ELMORE:  But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to?   Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are  switching off television and they're watching programming differently.  But  also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of  seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p> ELMORE:  And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They got a lot of work to do.  I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday  and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways.  Like not covering  breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p> And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget  resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan.  Now, the real  drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?  </p><p> And Harvey Weinstein suing the company that bears his name to get his  personal files.  The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to  defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan  clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4  trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p> The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on  this.  Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE:  I think the negative votes that came  were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p> KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in  every state.  Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would  -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p> They are worried because their state and local politicians are just  hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden.  We're  working with those lawmakers --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax  plan in the following weeks.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants  the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p> Joining us now is --</p><p> SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA:  Ballotpedia</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen.   I knew I was going to foul that up.  Can the G -- can the tax reform get  done by the end of the year?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  It has to.  I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican  senators who loosen their primaries.  And the base is so angry with the  inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be  done.</p><p> What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will  let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to  see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care.   I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw  the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  John --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators  who don't care what happened.</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax  reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.  </p><p> This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of  lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and  through a different approach.  It's something that will get done.  But I  don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw  yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to these pieces down because this is something  that I have lost my head over.  My eye have been in a full rage for the  last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to  401(k) contribution.</p><p> So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over  these 401(k) plan details.  Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou  Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any  cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRADY:  He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do  I.  We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more.   He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p> Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do  that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing.  I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a  contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400,  that's a fact.  And now you get this response.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you.  It's  also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict  tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p> 401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became.  It was a  mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and  figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of  millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it is.  Because they lost --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is.  It absolutely is.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are  going to be huge issue.  You say that this has to get done, this tax plan  has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash  this out.</p><p> And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local  taxes and those deductions.  So I guess my question is, you see it has to  get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p> RASMUSSEN:  What you will see happening is state and local deductions,  there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that  affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p> And that's where the money is.  So that's why these fights will be so  intense.  The popular support around the country is to get rid of these  things that benefit high income people.  High income earners are the ones  with the most influence.</p><p> So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and  local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation.  I think you'll see  the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as  they're talking about right now.</p><p> And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with  economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Scott.  We need to go.  Sorry Erin.  Great to see you.   But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's  not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise.  Based on the plan  right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years.  It's  not worth it.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics.  They  have to pass something.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because there is no substance in politics.  </p><p> RASMUSSEN:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Scott Rasmussen, great to see you.  In case you missed it,  here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future  Investment Initiative.  There is something of a revolution going on in  Saudi Arabia right now.  They are starting from scratch hoping to build  industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh  hoping to get a piece of this build up.  His royal highness, Prince  Mohammad bin Salman.  </p><p> MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and  of large companies are individuals.</p><p> Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi  people are less than 30-years-old.  And quite frankly, we will not waste 30  years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas.  We will be starting  today.</p><p> ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS:  The crowned prince  and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of  the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p> If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast  and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal.  It is going to  be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p> XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE:  This potential transaction needs  to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting  the growth of Saudi economy.  Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance  on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p> Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and  Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do.  I do think it's because of our  mindset.  We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I  would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an  investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p> The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods?  And I'm all for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply  reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p> GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax  bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's  retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea.  We've got to get away  from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words  against you.  His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I  don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to  Trump.</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was kind of  shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the  Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself.  And, look, it's factual, if  we get the growth, it will pay down the debt.  So we can debate whether we  get the growth or not.  But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL:  What we've witnessed is not a  misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox.  The  machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for  them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop  bickering.  And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  An earnings  blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names  closing out the busiest week of earning season.  We bring you the numbers  as they come out.  And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans,  Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent, Alphabet, all delivering better than  expected results.  Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to  a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.  </p><p> The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Google actually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday.  Later this morning, we get the  first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite  three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy.   We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany.  In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains  there in the fourth major market that we watched.  Declaring a crisis,  President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in  America.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This epidemic is a national  health emergency.  In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's  going on now.  As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  It's time  to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction.  Never been  this way.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead.  A  disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why Harvey Weinstein is suing  his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal.  A real  deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging  more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.  </p><p> A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking  amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction.  And if I  had the coin, I would pay it.  Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down  with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi  Investment Conference yesterday.  She asked him about everything from  Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities.  Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time.   Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're  talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of  every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data.  So zero in  for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in  industry?</p><p> PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND:  Certainly, you know, for example,  Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each  of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the  sharing economy or social networking for Facebook.  But, that's a  misleading way to describe it.  It was much better to think of them as  solving a very specific problem.  </p><p> Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute.  It's not the sharing economy  obstruction.  It's the hotel room substitute.  It's the only company that's  doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company.   Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is  what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is  going to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the  opportunities in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city,  what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about  the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon  Valley, very many other places.  It is but -- even though there are these  incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things.   And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of  subway, or something like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> THIEL:  In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or  anything new.  The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is  this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect,  it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city  has been built.  If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would  say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the  developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are  generally inadequate.  </p><p> The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend.  It's a very important  trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously.   If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute  because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some  things would change.  I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are  a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars.  It's  hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning  you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So, are robots going to  be taking our jobs?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous  about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all  because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers  or the last generation of computers or anything in between.  We can mean  things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in  the future.  </p><p> If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you  had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I  would say that the problem with that is not economic but political.  It'll  be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens  landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment  rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things  like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p> THIEL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is  serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we  feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more  powerful?</p><p> THIEL:  Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have  all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is,  that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.  </p><p> And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure  out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems.  And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you  can do a lot.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's --  there is something about it where it's very asymmetric.  That, you know, in  most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty  good.  </p><p> But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend.  It's very easy to attack.   And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack,  incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges.  I  think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them.  We  certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to  take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p> THIEL:  I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating  Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of  money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need  to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion  worth of Bitcoin in the world.  </p><p> There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber  equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential  left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people  in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms  or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi  Arabia.  Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad  operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate  engine revving again.  And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount  that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back!  Futures pointing to a higher open -- really,  fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right  now.  We're looking at a few stocks on the move.  General Electric one of  the name to watch.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its  railroad business.  The report says that the move is part of new CEO John  Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple  years.  Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now.  They  need a little bit of ballots here.  </p><p> We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter  earnings after the bell yesterday.  Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above  analyst estimates of $0.80 a share.  The company also raising its full-year  outlook.  Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.  </p><p> Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National  Prescription Drug Takeback Day.  Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go  through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by  taking them to designated collection sites.  Leftover opioid painkillers  can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by  the DEA and local agencies.  Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare  reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid  a public health emergency.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TRUMP:  I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best  personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a  problem with alcohol.  But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that  is what I think is so important. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Another headline we're following for you this morning: Harvey  Weinstein, suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he  claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal  claims.  Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last  week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  </p><p> And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports  he sexually harassed five women.  Penguin Press says it's canceling the  next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential  campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann.  And HBO is scrapping a  miniseries tied to that book.  Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.  </p><p> Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world  record for a wristwatch at auction.  The watch was given to Newman by his  wife on the set of the film winning.  Later, Newman gifted to a Southern  Ailes close friend.  A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman  Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well.  Dagen and those are  your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Paul Newman.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch.  It didn't belong  to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie.  So, I  would wear them both at the same time.  Coming up, the true cause of war;  we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You  For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the implication on the victim?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Close it, please.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Bryan, it can't be.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This was on the body.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The truth will set you free.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Help!</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering  today.  It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday  weekend.  Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain  Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Has it been eight?  Has it really  been eight, Dagen?  No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these  movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run  from that person.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror  history at the box office.  These movies have brought close to a billion  dollars.  So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number  one.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\"  I  thought that the first one was unbelievable.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic.  The ones after that, not so  much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible  year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, \"IT\", definitely.  Michael, so you have a chance to sit  down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq  war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Fantastic movie.  The only interview Miles Teller is doing with  Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this  incredible movie.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TAMMERO:  Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\"  You  described this as your toughest role.  How so?</p><p> MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR:  I mean, I think to try and embody somebody  else's trauma -- is difficult, you know.  And especially, for Adam to kind  of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days  in combat.  You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I rode shotgun and leave hungry.  And I look for bombs.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stop the truck </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What you got?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see nothing there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't see; he feels it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape  perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have  been doing battle day in and day out.    </p><p> TELLER:  Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the  -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through  when they get home.  Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause,  because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even  more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.  </p><p> JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR:  We just have to make sure that as a  country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to  make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men  and women we are sending over into them.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much.  And if you have one  movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this  weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not a hero.  We're brothers, we protect each other.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   I'm only human after all.  Don't put the blame on me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'd rather see that than a horror.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle  continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic  portrayal of their struggles.  And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American  Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling  some of these stories.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think it's incredible.  Michael, thank you for bringing this  up.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Have an awesome weekend!</p><p> TAMMERO:  You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry.  Thank  you, Michael.  Still ahead, \"Hercules\" star Kevin Sorbo here.

That is it for \"FBN:am.\" We now turn it over to the lovely, the talented Dagen McDowell and say good morning. \"Mornings With Maria\" start now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Back at you Cheryl. We'll see you in a little bit. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell in for <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It's Friday, October 27th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings extravaganza, we are awaiting reports from big names including Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron this morning. This comes after one stellar afternoon for some tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft, and Googleall delivering better than expected earnings results.</p><p>Amazon shares jumping on the news making CEO Jeff Bezos $6 billion richer. By the way, Google and Microsofthitting all time highs in the post market. And it wasn't the only good news for the retailer, Amazongaining wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states.</p><p>The move, part of the driving force behind CBS reported proposal to buy health insurer Aetna for a staggering $66 billion.</p><p>Futures are showing this in the markets right here right now, gains across the board. The DOW Industrial Futures up 42 points at the moment. This is after gains yesterday in the markets.</p><p>Later this morning we get the first reading on how fast the U.S. economy was growing in the last quarter. Investors are also eyeing key developments out of Washington, of course, including the House passing a budget paving the way forward for highly anticipated tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>REP. PAUL RYAN, </nameText></person>(R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I am very, very excited because today, we passed a budget that is physically responsible, it strengthens our national defense, and it's really good for taxpayers.</p><p>That means more jobs, fairer taxes, too long the American people have been living under a broken system. So much time and money is wasted just complying with this incredibly complicated tax code, it's unsustainable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: More on the prospect of getting that deal done straight ahead.</p><p>In Europe, we have -- looking at the markets in England, France and Germany. We have gains across the board, the biggest winner so far into Friday's trading day there. The CAC Krones in France up more than one percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, stock ending the day higher as well. Gains in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the Nikkei, and Japan, and the Kospi in South Korea across the board. The Nikkei the biggest winner.</p><p>And the truth is out there but not all of it. Conspiracy theorist outrage after the White House continues to keep some <person><nameText>JFK's assassination </nameText></person>files under wraps. The biggest revelations from what was released coming up.</p><p>Plus, iPhone lovers braving the early morning hours to get the iPhone X, the latest as preorders for the highly anticipated device go up online.</p><p>And furor on the field, the tensed moments after Miami Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso hits Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the head knocking him out of the game. Awful hit.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and so much. Joining me all morning long, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle. Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly. Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Erin Elmore. Great to see you Erin as always.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER TRUMP SURROGATE: You as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lea, I see you everyday even in the hall. And I know you are so fired up about -- because there is so much news in the markets from earnings. We have the first reading on the third quarter GDP coming up which could be a huge market mover as well.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, KELLY AND COMPANY MANAGING PARTNER: I don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even though (INAUDIBLE) I say it is a market mover.</p><p>KELLY: I couldn't sleep last night. I mean it was just like I was so excited, there's so much happening. And the people we have coming on today to talk about it, I mean that's what I'm even more excited about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let's tee that up. Thank you for teeing it up Kevin.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And coming up this morning, Venture Capitalist and Partner of (INAUDIBLE) Peter Thiel. His conversation with Maria. New York Stock Exchange president, Tom Farley. Softbank Investment Advisor CEO and Board of Director, Rajeev Misra. And TV And Film star, Kevin Sorbo on his new movie and so much more coming out.</p><p>By the way, I'll be on \"Outnumbered \" later with Kevin Sorbo as the one lucky guy.</p><p>But first, we are keeping an eye on earnings, a big day for interview with Exxon, Chevron, and Phillips 66 all out with quarterly numbers before the bell.</p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, Merck also expected to report within the hour. And, of course, we're watching shares of Amazon after the company reported record quarterly revenue. Amazon also reportedly getting into the pharmacy business.</p><p>That was according -- I love being able to attribute stories to individual newspapers. There's a story in the\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" that Amazon has received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states.</p><p>This as the drugstore giant CVS is said to be in talks to buy the nation's third largest health insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion. Kevin, where do you want to start? Do you want to start with Amazon and then this deal because they kind of go one -- they go together.</p><p>KELLY: I think it's pretty interesting to report on Amazon right now and given the fact that Amazon even (INAUDIBLE) is 52-week high. So we actually saw it reached $1,082 a share.</p><p>The interesting aspect about Amazon is the biggest threat to them is regulation. We see that they don't even really pay taxes. When you look at Walmart, they're paying billions of dollars of taxes every single quarter.</p><p>So the big play here on Amazon is their Amazon web services. They continuously dominate in that facet. The clear number one -- Microsoft is number two really in cloud services but they don't even compete.</p><p>What they're trying to compete on is really what's called hybrid cloud. So what that means is companies that have servers on site, they can actually replicate it up in the cloud too so they can pull from the cloud as well as on site.</p><p>Now what's interesting is, Amazon did a deal with VMware last October to compete against Microsoft on that. And Amazon web services, they continuously cut their cost to be the number one player in that space.</p><p>So it's so interesting how Amazon conducts business and then you start to see it play out into the pharmacy side, right, because they have the delivery mechanisms, right, the logistics. Their -- 50 percent of their sales are third party distributors on the e-commerce sites, so that's pretty telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Huge move up in Aetna stock on those report yesterday. And by the way, it is the top story in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today. Boo, there you go, $66 billion offer.</p><p>Multiple meetings between the two CEOs of CVS and Aetna, how could this potentially change not just CVS's business? Because CVS has been moving toward more of a healthcare business as their overall retail sales as a percentage of their revenue have been falling, the smaller percent of their revenue.</p><p>But this could do -- in the \"Journal\" they point out, this could leverage negotiations with drug makers for CVS over -- it would get a great deal, more health data from owning Aetna and it would be -- give an ability to strike new deals that tie drug prices to patient outcomes.</p><p>I just think that the possibilities are limitless when you have a pharmacy like this buying a health insurance company.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. And the -- yes. And that's the interesting aspect, right? CVS has no experience whatsoever in the insurance business. And then they're coming out the gate and they're buying one of the largest health insurers.</p><p>And this goes back to drug pricing, right? We've seen a lot of chatter about pharmacy benefit managers and what the rebates are being. On drug pricing you have the drug makers pointing to the pharmacy benefit manufacturers and you have the insurers pointing it back at them.</p><p>So it's such an interesting dynamic and this shows you how much it's going to change over the next couple years and CVS is trying to get in front of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that it's fascinating to just think about the possibility with Amazon filing these wholesale pharmacy licenses that -- because people in Washington, even President Trump has talked about on the campaign trail driving down the cost to prescription medications.</p><p>Well how about letting the private industry to it with the license -- Amazon coming and becoming a major negotiator with these drug company.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And I think one of the things that we'll see is how regulators get involved and how lawmakers get involved.</p><p>As you mentioned in regulations if Amazon does move in, but I think that that will be balanced by the potential for drug prices to come way down if Amazon does get into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>ELMORE: Well Amazon does everything right. But I sort of feel that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Until they don't. That day is coming, we just don't know when that might happen.</p><p>ELMORE: Well I think Amazon has captured a lot of CVS's market share in terms of their retail products. And now that Amazon is the one that's getting into the pharmaceutical world, is CVS sort of the one that the cat chasing its tail?</p><p>KELLY: Yes. I think the interesting aspect about Amazon and what they're trying to do here is that they are -- the next leg of growth for them in their stock price and that's what we need to focus on is their ad sales, right?</p><p>So they just are opening a new headquarters here for ad sales. What they're going to do is server replacement on the front page. So if you're a company, they've got what you listen to on your -- on Amazon Music, they've got instant prime video, now they're going to see what you buy at the pharmacy, they have -- they're delivering it to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People talk about Amazon's getting too big but if you read into these earnings reports from Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet, there is still a competition out there for Amazon in myriad ways.</p><p>Alphabet reported a 40 percent increase and non-advertising revenue, that's strength of its cloud competing business, that was $3.4 billion there. And then Microsoft had a huge surge and two critical components of its cloud computing business as your infrastructure services in the Office 365 online.</p><p>Both of those, the revenue there respectively up 90 percent and 42 percent. So there is competition for some of Amazon's businesses.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Well, there's -- they're broken up differently. Which Microsoft --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Which you've mentioned earlier.</p><p>KELLY: Right. So Microsoft is sort of the utility play and they actually pay a dividend like that. Think about how Googledoesn't even pay a dividend, okay? And they're constantly reinvesting.</p><p>So what Microsoft did is they switched their business from one time enterprise sales into subscriptions, right? So for Office 365 you now pay on a yearly basis it automatically updates, you rollover, you get the latest edition.</p><p>So they're all trying to transition. And what they do best for all these companies is they have the best leaderships. (INAUDIBLE) came out, Microsoft finally got to -- off to the races and dominating in their actually core competencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And one thing I'll point out because I'm a stats nerd, in one hour after the close of trading yesterday after the earnings came out for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, $80 billion in market value was added.</p><p>I said that at the top of the show, $80 billion in one hour for three companies. Really incredible -- again, you want to know why the markets moving up despite D.C. doing nothing on tax reform so far or healthcare reform is because of these earnings.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, exactly. Largest sector in the S&amp;P500 and they've also benefited from the weak dollar.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you sir. So much more to talk about. I didn't even get - - we didn't even get -- we didn't even get to talk about the new iPhone X which was I watching online to see what the delivery times are now.</p><p>They were out to five weeks in delivery times. They don't even start shipping until early November, November 3rd I think.</p><p>We're going to talk about all of that. Coming up, newly released government records about President John F. Kennedy's assassination are released but there still more questions than answers. Were the Russians involved?</p><p>And sold out, if you are planning to preorder an iPhone X before you started your day this morning, you are officially too late. More on that ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The White House delaying the release of some of the <person><nameText>JFK </nameText></person>assassination documents sighting national security concerns. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE: Where's Kevin Costner when you need him Dagen? Historians, conspiracy theorists upset that President Trump didn't release the entire collection.</p><p>A 1992 law mandated that all the documents be publicly disclosed this year. But the CIA and the FBI asked that some information be withheld. President Trump put those files under a six-month review saying that he basically had no choice.</p><p>But the 20,000 pages that were released reveal some pretty interesting new details like Lee Harvey Oswald meeting a KGB agent in Mexico two months before the shooting. And get this, the CIA had been involved in assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro.</p><p>So like I said, there will be movies and TV shows about these new documents I'm sure coming out.</p><p>Okay. Preorders for the Apple iPhone X starting today but you're probably going to have trouble getting your hands on one. Sources say supplies of a hot new phone already sold out. Shipping estimates are slipping well beyond November 3rd launch date.</p><p>In fact, we're talking weeks, maybe months. The news coming on weak sales of the iPhone8. Two research firms say that the iPhone8 posted the weakest sales of any of the company's new smartphones. People are still getting the 7 basically. Shares of Apple trading higher in the premarket.</p><p>Well, a costly win for the Baltimore Ravens against the Miami Dolphins last night. Second quarter, watch the hit on quarterback Joe Flacco. Kiko Alonso nailed him, knocks of Flacco's helmet. A fight ensues after all this goes down. Just waiting for the fight.</p><p>Anyway, unnecessary roughness got called against Alonso. Now he crushed Flacco as he goes for the quarterback flight. Flacco would go straight into the locker room. He had a concussion, he did not come back to the game.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Football League has also taken some hits these days. A new FOX News poll finds that the league's favorable rating is dropping. Forty six percent of voters have a positive view of the NFL now but that's down eighteen points from four years ago.</p><p>Forty one percent view it in a negative way, that's an increase. Fans are also starting to come around the NFL players kneeling for the national anthem. Yes, forty four percent think kneeling is appropriate. That's up from forty one percent who felt that way last month and thirty two percent who didn't really -- they liked in September.</p><p>But basically still a majority think that it's inappropriate Dagen to kneel during the national anthem at a football game.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Cheryl. Kevin, so we see the favorability ratings clutching with the earnings -- the ratings haven't fallen that much. They're down year-over-year but -- were earlier in the season but they're not down that much.</p><p>KELLY: No, it's not. And I mean there's so much business and entertainment that revolves around the NFL that you really wouldn't see it come down from fantasy football to sports betting, to everything that revolves around it.</p><p>I mean even think about the Super Bowl half time show, right? I mean it's such a big production put on by Pepsi that we talk about how, \"Oh my gosh, Justin Timberlake is coming up.\"</p><p>ELMORE: Commercial -- the commercials are half of the fun too, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not anymore. I'm tired because you see all the commercials beforehand, here's my favorite tweet from Pat Sajak yesterday. He said, \"Staying away from politics and social issues on my birthday. I'll just relax and watch an NFL game and maybe a couple of late night talk show.\"</p><p>GABRIELLE: That's funny.</p><p>ELMORE: I love it.</p><p>GABRIELLE: And even the point is, if you want to hit them where it counts, you hit the ratings, you turn off your televisions, you hit the pocketbooks and ultimately it trickles down. So that's the way you do it.</p><p>ELMORE: But since rating are down, what do you think we attribute that to? Is it the CTE and the brain injury scandals or --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think some of it is -- I think some of it is that people are switching off television and they're watching programming differently. But also it's certainly impacted it somewhat is that they're just tired of seeing the political shenanigans in sports.</p><p>ELMORE: And \"ESPN\" is sort of a thing in the past these days.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They got a lot of work to do. I was watching \"ESPN\" yesterday and \"ESPN\" has a lot of work to do in a lot of ways. Like not covering breaking news, but that's what we do here is cover breaking news.</p><p>And coming up, just four votes, it was a narrow win for the budget resolution that clears the way for the president's tax plan. Now, the real drama begins, can the GOP come together to get this done by year's end?</p><p>And <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>suing the company that bears his name to get his personal files. The fired movie executive is trying to get documents to defend himself against a mountain of sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turning now the road to tax reform, President Trump's tax plan clearing another major hurdle, the house narrowly approving the Senate's $4 trillion budget measure yesterday paving the way for tax reform.</p><p>The plan was passed with a vote of 216 to 212, 20 republicans voting nay on this. Here's what Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady had to say yesterday after the vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, SECRTARY OF COMERCE: I think the negative votes that came were probably mostly over the deductibility of state and local.</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX) HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We're proposing to flatten the brackets, lower the tax rates for everybody in every state. Lawmakers in very high tax states, New York, New Jersey would -- Illinois and California, others as well.</p><p>They are worried because their state and local politicians are just hammering them with taxes and so they worry about that burden. We're working with those lawmakers --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The tax writing committee will hold a markup for the GOP tax plan in the following weeks. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he wants the House to pass a tax bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p>Joining us now is --</p><p>SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA: Ballotpedia</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ballotpedia Editor-at-Large, Political Analyst, Scott Rasmussen. I knew I was going to foul that up. Can the G -- can the tax reform get done by the end of the year?</p><p>RASMUSSEN: It has to. I mean if it doesn't, there will be some republican senators who loosen their primaries. And the base is so angry with the inability pass -- to repeal ObamaCare, they're looking for something to be done.</p><p>What yesterday's vote did, it said we need to have a procedure that will let us pass something with 51 votes, that's all it was and we're going to see lots of horse trading between now and the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. But senators who aren't up for reelection don't care. I'll point to John McCain, John McCain won his seat last year and you saw the -- on the healthcare bill --</p><p>RASMUSSEN: John --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I -- so I push back on that that there are a lot of senators who don't care what happened.</p><p>RASMUSSEN: But the republican senators are more united on a desire for tax reform than they were on the -- on changes to ObamaCare.</p><p>This is an issue that really does unite the republicans of the idea of lower tax rates, the idea of growing the economy through tax cuts and through a different approach. It's something that will get done. But I don't think it's going to look anything like the framework we saw yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get to these pieces down because this is something that I have lost my head over. My eye have been in a full rage for the last week over the GOP tinkering or messing with or taking a hatchet to 401(k) contribution.</p><p>So the president -- President Trump and the GOP has been battling over these 401(k) plan details. Chairman Brady of House Ways and Means told Lou Dobbs last night that he and the president were not planning to make any cuts to 401(k) plans, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRADY: He wants to increase the amount of savings in 401(k)'s limit, so do I. We want to encourage more people to save sooner in life and save more. He and I are going to work together on this effort.</p><p>Within the day, if we can't find consensus in the country on how best to do that, we'll leave them as they are --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a -- that's tap dance, verbal tap dancing. I hear it's - - because listen, they in Washington have been talking about cutting in a contribution limit from $18,000 a year, it's $18,500 next year to $2,400, that's a fact. And now you get this response.</p><p>RASMUSSEN: And I think it's something that shouldn't furiate you. It's also a great example though of what the problem is with trying to predict tax reform and what it will end up being.</p><p>401(k)s themselves were never intended to be what they became. It was a mistake written to the law, a guy named Ted Benna actually read the law and figured out somehow Congress had made this mistake and we now have tens of millions of people who see this is a cornerstone of retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well because it is. Because they lost --</p><p>GABRIELLE: It is. It absolutely is.</p><p>RASMUSSEN: That's correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE: And they're talking about those pretax contribution limits are going to be huge issue. You say that this has to get done, this tax plan has to be done but the devil's going to be at the details when they hash this out.</p><p>And yesterday, we saw 20 noes and that was because of the state and local taxes and those deductions. So I guess my question is, you see it has to get done, how can it get done when we have seen no details yet?</p><p>RASMUSSEN: What you will see happening is state and local deductions, there's a big issue for people who live in New York and New Jersey, that affects higher income earners more to lower income people.</p><p>And that's where the money is. So that's why these fights will be so intense. The popular support around the country is to get rid of these things that benefit high income people. High income earners are the ones with the most influence.</p><p>So I think you'll end up seeing is something will be done on state and local deductions but it will not be a full of a nation. I think you'll see the same thing with 401(k)s, they will trim something back, not as much as they're talking about right now.</p><p>And they're going to do it with one goal in mind, it has nothing to do with economics, it will all be, \"Where's the 50 first votes?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Scott. We need to go. Sorry Erin. Great to see you. But if they tinker even a little bit with 401(k) plans, my issue is it's not worth the little bit of revenue that it will raise. Based on the plan right now, it would only raise a quarter of a trillion over 10 years. It's not worth it.</p><p>RASMUSSEN: And you're talking substance, I'm just talking politics. They have to pass something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Because there is no substance in politics.</p><p>RASMUSSEN: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scott Rasmussen, great to see you. In case you missed it, here's some of this week's top moments from the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>MARIA BARTIROMO, </nameText></person>FBN HOST: From Riyadh, Saudi Arabia we are at the Future Investment Initiative. There is something of a revolution going on in Saudi Arabia right now. They are starting from scratch hoping to build industries, you've got the titans of business here on the ground in Riyadh hoping to get a piece of this build up. His royal highness, Prince Mohammad bin Salman.</p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWNED PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA: The opportunity is unimaginable. A region that is almost vacant, there are many dreams from the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many -- and our partners and of large companies are individuals.</p><p>Thousands of dreams that will be established, 70 percent of the Saudi people are less than 30-years-old. And quite frankly, we will not waste 30 years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas. We will be starting today.</p><p>ALAN SCHWARTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS: The crowned prince and everybody really announcing that they are changing the whole nature of the way they think about this economy and this culture.</p><p>If they take the reforms that they're talking about, this whole Gulf Coast and Saudi as a leader could have a real revival going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Investors are watching the Saudi Aramco deal. It is going to be the largest IPO in the world.</p><p>XAVIER ROLET, CEO, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE: This potential transaction needs to be looked in the context of an overall strategy of effectively promoting the growth of Saudi economy. Overtime, reducing, of course, it's reliance on the export of hydrocarbons.</p><p>Maria Do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:I do. I do think it's because of our mindset. We've spend six decades since the martial plan the consumer. I would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in things like manufacturing.</p><p>The president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in America as an exporter of manufactured goods? And I'm all for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: House republicans were reportedly considering a plan to sharply reduce the amount of money that Americans can save in their 401(k) plans.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: If having higher tax bracket was a stupid idea, and it is, going after savings for people's retirement is a particularly god-awful stupid idea. We've got to get away from punishing people's ability to save for their own retirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waging a war of words against you. His statements are outlandish and he seems just to want to, I don't know if I'm allowed today use this word, I think I am, suck up to Trump.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES: I was kind of shocked that he'd be saying that about me or about any Secretary of the Treasury and, you know, I restrained myself. And, look, it's factual, if we get the growth, it will pay down the debt. So we can debate whether we get the growth or not. But i was quite surprised of his comments.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK JR., CEO OF COLONY CAPITAL: What we've witnessed is not a misfire by President Trump, his voice playing badly in the sandbox. The machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop bickering. And nobody toys with President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It's Friday, October 27th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. An earnings blitz on Wall Street, Merck, Exxon, Chevron, just a few of the names closing out the busiest week of earning season. We bring you the numbers as they come out. And it comes after a huge day for three tech titans, Amazon, Microsoft and Googleparent, Alphabet, all delivering better than expected results. Turning to broader markets, you have Futures pointing to a higher open 43 point gain on the Dow Futures.</p><p>The likes of Microsoft and Alphabet, parent of Googleactually hit an all- time high in post market trading yesterday. Later this morning, we get the first reading on how fast the economy was growing last quarter, not quite three percent of the expectation, but pretty close for the U.S. economy. We head to Europe, we have gains across the board in England, France and Germany. In Asia overnight, stocks ending the week higher as well, gains there in the fourth major market that we watched. Declaring a crisis, President Trump setting his sights on the rise of opioid addiction in America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This epidemic is a national health emergency. In our lifetime, nobody has seen anything like what's going on now. As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue. It's time to liberate our communities from discourse of drug addiction. Never been this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: How the President plans to combat that epidemic, ahead. A disgraced Hollywood heavyweight hits back, why <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>is suing his former company in the wake of his sexual harassment scandal. A real deal or a box office flop, Regal Theatres testing surge pricing charging more for the biggest blockbusters, we will look at how it will work.</p><p>A Cool Hand Luke's wristwatch does not come cheap, the record-breaking amount that Paul Newman's legendary Rolex, brought in at auction. And if I had the coin, I would pay it. Our top story this half hour, Maria sat down with Venture Capitalist and Founder Fund Partner, Peter Thiel at the Saudi Investment Conference yesterday. She asked him about everything from Artificial Intelligence to investment communities or opportunities. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you first founded PayPal, we were in a different time. Today, we are talking about data, we're talking about the Cloud, we're talking about digitizing our life and technology is the under pending of every industry whether it's driverless cars or collecting data. So zero in for us on industries, where are you finding opportunity to invest in industry?</p><p>PETER THIEL, PARTNER OF FOUNDERS FUND: Certainly, you know, for example, Airbnb, SpaceX, Facebook earlier on, you know, investments I made and each of these companies, you can describe them as part of the trends or the sharing economy or social networking for Facebook. But, that's a misleading way to describe it. It was much better to think of them as solving a very specific problem.</p><p>Airbnb was, sort of, a hotel room substitute. It's not the sharing economy obstruction. It's the hotel room substitute. It's the only company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a kind company. Facebook somehow figured out real identity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One scene that we've been talking about, of course, here, is what his Highness is doing with NEOM and all of the technology that is going to be in this new city of the future. Where do you see the opportunities in terms of starting from scratch? When you have a city, what kind of technologies are going to be most needed?</p><p>THIEL: Well, it's -- there's a tremendous amount that one can do when one starts something new from scratch, because one thing that is striking about the great cities of the world, like London, New York, you know, Silicon Valley, very many other places. It is but -- even though there are these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change things. And so, you know, New York City, it costs $1 billion to build one mile of subway, or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>THIEL: In San Francisco, you can't -- you can't build new highways or anything new. The transportation grid is set, and so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem with the big cities where in effect, it becomes incredibly hard to build new transportation once the basic city has been built. If the transportation systems are inadequate and i would say they are badly inadequate in all of our major cities even in the developed world, emerging world, the catastrophic developed world, they are generally inadequate.</p><p>The self-driving car trend, it's against the trend. It's a very important trend for the economy, for -- and change consumer behavior tremendously. If you have self-driving cars, maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change. I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars. It's hard to know exactly how to differentiated they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And people are worried that the more A.I. and machine learning you have, in a situation, the fewer jobs you have. So, are robots going to be taking our jobs?</p><p>THIEL: Well, it's -- one of the things -- you know, I'm always nervous about the abstractions, A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the last generation of computers or anything in between. We can mean things that are like a little bit in the future or, you know, very far in the future.</p><p>If you had generalized Artificial Intelligence, this, sort of, where you had a computer that was smarter and more able in every way possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but political. It'll be like an alien from another planet landing and the question, if aliens landed on earth, would not be, what does this mean for the unemployment rate, the question would be, are they friendly, are they unfriendly, things like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>THIEL: And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question is serious, it's much more the political question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What can we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone's getting hacked and data has become so much more powerful?</p><p>THIEL: Well, there is a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in combining computers with humans. And, you know, a lot of the approaches in crime, defense, areas like this, and security, have been -- we either have all human solutions or all computer solutions and I think the truth is, that there's a lot to be done with these intermediate hybrid solutions.</p><p>And what we did at PayPal, and what we've done at pounds here, is figure out a good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer systems. And it turns out that if you get the division of labor right, you can do a lot. One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there is something about it where it's very asymmetric. That, you know, in most forms of defense, military technologies, the defense side is pretty good.</p><p>But in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend. It's very easy to attack. And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual challenges. I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do about them. We certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're not willing to take the precautions that are needed and it really calls out for some big - - a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've been really successful in terms of watching where the growth is in the world, and identifying the companies that are, you know, solving important problems, what excites you right now?</p><p>THIEL: I do think people are a little bit -- maybe underestimating Bitcoin, specifically, because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's like gold and it's just a store value, you don't actually need to use make payments, and it's been, you know, there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world.</p><p>There's $9 trillion worth of gold and if Bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold, and it has -- it has a -- it has a great potential left, so that's -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in Silicon Valley normally focus on, companies, not, you know, algorithms or protocols but, this may be -- this may be one exception that's very underestimated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel with Maria, in Saudi Arabia. Coming up, the end of the line for General Electrics' railroad operations it's all reportedly part of the plan to get G.E.'s corporate engine revving again. And record-breaking Rolex, the jaw-dropping amount that acting legend, Paul Newman's watch clocked in at auction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back! Futures pointing to a higher open -- really, fueled the market run by earnings, 45-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. We're looking at a few stocks on the move. General Electric one of the name to watch.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal, reporting the company's looking to leave its railroad business. The report says that the move is part of new CEO John Flannery's plans to divest billions of dollars in assets in the next couple years. Shares of G.E. are moving up half of one percent right now. They need a little bit of ballots here.</p><p>We're also watching Intel, the tech giant reporting strong third-quarter earnings after the bell yesterday. Earnings-per-share of $1.01 well above analyst estimates of $0.80 a share. The company also raising its full-year outlook. Shares of Intel, moving up four percent gain, almost.</p><p>Meantime, President Donald Trump, promoting tomorrow's National Prescription Drug Takeback Day. Cheryl Casone has more on this, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Dagen, the president calling on Americans to go through their medicine chest and get rid of leftover prescription drugs by taking them to designated collection sites. Leftover opioid painkillers can pose a risk for addiction and overdoses; the program is sponsored by the DEA and local agencies. Meanwhile, President Trump, making a rare reference to his late brother, Fred, in yesterday's speech declaring opioid a public health emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I had a brother, Fred, great guy, best-looking guy, best personality -- much better than mine -- but he had a problem; he had a problem with alcohol. But I learned because of Fred, I learned, and that is what I think is so important.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Another headline we're following for you this morning: <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein, </nameText></person>suing the company he founded demanding access to documents, he claims, can help with his potential defense against civil and criminal claims. Weinstein was removed as CEO, then resigned from the board last week amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>And NBC Political Analyst, Mark Halperin, is losing deals following reports he sexually harassed five women. Penguin Press says it's canceling the next edition of its \"Game Change\" book about the 2016 presidential campaign, co-authored with John Heilemann. And HBO is scrapping a miniseries tied to that book. Halperin already has been suspended by NBC.</p><p>Well, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona, selling $17.8 million, setting a world record for a wristwatch at auction. The watch was given to Newman by his wife on the set of the film winning. Later, Newman gifted to a Southern Ailes close friend. A portion of the proceeds goes to The Nell Newman Foundation -- the inscription, pretty great as well. Dagen and those are your headlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If I was rolling in cabbage, I'd buy it.</p><p>CASONE: Paul Newman.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've got -- my watch is a Steve McQueen watch. It didn't belong to him but it's the Monaco Tag Warrior from \"Le Mans\" the movie. So, I would wear them both at the same time. Coming up, the true cause of war; we have a preview of the must-see new film about the Iraq War, \"Thank You For Your Service,\" that is next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the implication on the victim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Close it, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But he's been dead for ten years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bryan, it can't be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was on the body.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The truth will set you free.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Help!</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was a clip from the eighth saw film, \"Jigsaw,\" premiering today. It's been seven years since a saw film has kicked off the holiday weekend. Michael Tammero is here; we're resurrecting the psycho villain Jigsaw breathe some life into this franchise.</p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Has it been eight? Has it really been eight, Dagen? No, to me the only been deeming (INAUDIBLE) these movies, if you see someone in line and the way we buy one, you know to run from that person.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAMMERO: Well that said, it's been about the biggest year in horror history at the box office. These movies have brought close to a billion dollars. So, this movie, unfortunately, looks to come in around number one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which -- the last one I really love was \"The Conjuring.\" I thought that the first one was unbelievable.</p><p>TAMMERO: The first \"Conjuring\" was fantastic. The ones after that, not so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>TAMMERO: You know, between \"IT\" and \"Get Out,\" it's been an incredible year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, \"IT\", definitely. Michael, so you have a chance to sit down with Miles Teller and Director Jason Hall to talk about the new Iraq war movie, \"Thank You For Your Service.\"</p><p>TAMMERO: Fantastic movie. The only interview Miles Teller is doing with Fox News, he came in along with Jason Hall who told me all about this incredible movie. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TAMMERO: Mile and Jason, thank you for stepping into the \"FOX LIGHT.\" You described this as your toughest role. How so?</p><p>MILES TELLER, AMERICAN ACTOR: I mean, I think to try and embody somebody else's trauma -- is difficult, you know. And especially, for Adam to kind of wrap up and be the sum of his experiences when he spent a thousand days in combat. You know, I don't -- that's really tough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I rode shotgun and leave hungry. And I look for bombs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop the truck</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't see the bomb unless they want you to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you got?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't see nothing there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't see; he feels it.</p><p>TAMMERO: Doing these movies, playing these roles, how has it sort of shape perspective on, sort of, the wars we fought, and the men and women who have been doing battle day in and day out.</p><p>TELLER: Well, it definitely gave me a perspective on, I guess, some of the -- you know, the obstacles and hurdles that these guys have to go through when they get home. Now, I can kind of help lend a voice to this cause, because I absolutely -- really, I have so much respect and now just, even more, empathy and compassion for these servicemen and women.</p><p>JASON HALL, AMERICAN DIRECTOR: We just have to make sure that as a country, we're sending honorable men and women over there, and we have to make sure that the conflicts that we enter into are as honorable as the men and women we are sending over into them.</p><p>TAMMERO: Well, Miles and Jason, thank you so much. And if you have one movie to see, make sure it's \"Thank You For Your Service\"; it opens up this weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not a hero.

And it's -- you know, for many, for some the battle continues once they come home; and this movie is really such a fantastic portrayal of their struggles. And Jason Hall, the man behind \"American Sniper\" along with this movie is really doing his own service in telling some of these stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think it's incredible. Michael, thank you for bringing this up.</p><p>TAMMERO: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you. Have an awesome weekend!</p><p>TAMMERO: You too, but come see \"Jigsaw\".</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I'll be just movie hanging with my dog doing laundry. Thank you, Michael.

Thanks so much for joining us. It is a busy one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, October 15th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings season kicking into high gear. JPMorgan out this morning with a beat on revenue. Jamie Dimon saying that the U.S. consumer remains healthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnson &amp; Johnson also out last hour with a double beat. J&amp;J also raising its full year guidance.</p><p>Check out the stocks. JPM up 1.25 percent. Johnson &amp; Johnson up 2.25 percent. We're waiting on other big banks this morning. Gold Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup -- all on tap, ahead of the open.</p><p>We're going to have a rock and roll show this morning with all these numbers coming out. We will have the numbers and full analysis as soon as they hit the tape.</p><p>Meanwhile markets are higher going into the rest of the earnings period. Dow Industrials right now indicating a gain at the start of trading, up 95 points. The S&amp;P futures are up 8.5. And the Nasdaq futures higher by 18.75 points. That's a quarter of a percent higher pretty much across the board.</p><p>There is uncertainty over the deal with China now and that certainly weighed on markets yesterday. Even though the market closed off of the lows of the day yesterday.</p><p>Dow Industrials were down about 30 points at the close yesterday. The S&amp;P was down 4 points and the Nasdaq lower by eight and a third at 4:00 on Wall Street.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices where the FT 100 is down 21 points. But the CAC 40 in Paris is up 30. And the DAX index in Germany is up 57.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed. Take a look. As you see, the best performer was Japan. Nikkei average up 1.87 percent. In China, inflation is surging. The consumer price index hitting 3 percent for September. The outbreak of the swine flu pushing pork prices up 69.3 percent year over year. That is the reason that the Chinese want to buy pork from the U.S. and soybeans.</p><p>Hunter Biden breaks his silence, defending his foreign ventures but admitting to making mistakes.</p><p>Plus this -- the push for impeachment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold closed door meetings as lawmakers return to Capitol Hill this week. This as more people are testifying. We have all the latest from the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>The streaming wars deepen. Disney gives a sneak peek at the massive amount of content coming to its service. This as the major theater chain enters the field. We will tell you all about it.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Deirdre Bolton; CampusReform.org editor in chief, Cabot Phillips; and Barron's editor Jack Otter. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JACK OTTER, EDITOR, BARRON'S: Good morning. Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I love earnings season because it gives us that window into really where we are. We have a lot of headlines in terms of where we are but when you actually see the numbers, you get a sense of just how slow the economy is or not slow -- Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. And third quarter earnings are expected to drop, if you look at this quarter versus last year at this time, 2.2 percent. But on the upside, sales expected to grow, this is net-net (INAUDIBLE), 3.7 percent.</p><p>Personally, I think that's a great sign. It shows competitive advantage. Earnings you can always manage, profitability somehow squeeze some department more than another. But sales are sales.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at Johnson &amp; Johnson. Even with 100,000 plaintiffs, they're getting sued all over the place, battling, losing a lot of cases in the court, they actually raised their guidance and had better than expected numbers on J&amp;J. Their stock is up 2.25 percent.</p><p>The top story this hour is JPMorgan, we told you the numbers earlier. The markets are reacting to these better than expected earnings on JPMorgan this morning. Still with us this morning -- and the stock is up 2 percent is -- still with us this morning is CFRA director of equity research, Ken Leon.</p><p>And Ken -- the numbers were expected to be weak in the third quarter. But are we getting the first signs that we're actually seeing higher than expected from the lowered estimates?</p><p>KEN LEON, DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: It's all coming on the surprise in the non-net interest income areas. So JPMorgan on leaked cables (ph) usually being number one or two in underwriting, strong in the consumer lending and maybe U.S. commercial lending is still strong too.</p><p>But the breaking news from China, one has to pause and say, well, how much revenue is coming outside the U.S. Most of the banks it's about 35 percent. There will be a lot of questions related to Asia. And for Citi, which is also one of four banks reporting, that has a higher sensitivity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You make a really good point, because one of the gives that China made just this the last week of negotiations was that it would lift the limits that foreign companies have faced for a long time in terms of owning your own bank, owning your own insurance company.</p><p>And people saw that as a real positive even though it wasn't really new information, by the way. That's been talked about for a long time. But does that represent a nice runway for these banks?</p><p>LEON: It's really important. Because when you think about Europe, and it's been the same, it's a slow economy, maybe to recession, and it's not a capital markets-driven market. So for the banks to really grow, you need Asia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Can I ask you one quick question? Did you see that move that Maria talked about? Will U.S. institutions open now more now on mainland China and defavorize (ph) Hong Kong which has traditionally been the western -- quote/unquote -- center in the east.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Such a good question.</p><p>LEON: It's a great question. But it's not in the next few years for sure. And even for the Hong Kong stock exchange to make a bid for the London Stock Exchange, just to be more global that was their hedge -- it didn't work out.</p><p>China has inside four major exchanges, but they do need Hong Kong because that's their gateway to more sophisticated derivatives and other instruments.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But's no secret that London doesn't want to go anywhere near the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and merge because they don't want to have China's authoritarian rule.</p><p>LEON: And that was done late in the day because London stock exchange already had a major transaction with Thompson Reuters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can we a bit talk about JPMorgan here for a second. Now Jack - - we know that the consumer has been the best part of this economic recovery.</p><p>OTTER: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And once again, the consumer is saving JPM because the corporate side has some holes in it with the Wework situation.</p><p>OTTER: Yes. Well, two interesting points that are totally unrelated. Wework -- I think the problem with the Weworks and the Ubers and these other companies is that they were literally giving you a dollar for 90- cents, 80-cents. With Wework they would lease the space and then they would chop it up. But they would lease it to you for less than their cost.</p><p>Uber -- you're getting a $15 cab ride for 10 bucks. That is unsustainable and it doesn't scale. The bigger they get, the more they lose. So that's the problem with that segment and we shouldn't say that all IPOs are bad because a software company does scale and they can do well.</p><p>So I think somebody referred to the fact that the market was finally getting smart. I think that was Ken. I think we're there.</p><p>LEON: And that's the capital markets.</p><p>I will say for the large banks thought, they've been conservative on commercial real estate lending. Certainly remembering the great recession, so their credit standards are toughest probably for commercial real estate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ken -- we're waiting on Goldman Sachs, we're waiting on Citi. Give us your sense of what we should be focused on when the Goldman numbers come out.</p><p>LEON: Goldman, obviously still number one, two or three player tables in elite tables for investment banking. What you have to watch is the quality of the results, the quality of the earnings. Last quarter it was a segment which is about 25 percent of revenue called investing and lending. That's their proprietary arm. That made Q2.</p><p>Let's see what Q3 is. And then there been, you know, more talk about diversification. This is a really smart management, new management, but its mark is the pathway.</p><p>And then, of course, you've got to remember with Goldman or Morgan Stanley, more so than larger banks, trading commission. And last week we had Schwab. Trading commission is still more institutional driven but there's a component that is still retail.</p><p>BOLTON: Is it smart --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- disrupting the financial services industry now for decades and they did it again two weeks ago -- Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I was going to ask, going from an institutional, somebody who serves institutions versus somebody who is serving now both institutions and retail. How is that going for Goldman? I mean you alluded to markets.</p><p>LEON: Absolutely. And bringing it back to Goldman, markets gets a lot of attention. But they're making acquisitions in asset management and areas where they have recurring revenue, cash flow. If you have that consistency, you get a higher valuation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Great stuff.</p><p>Goldman Sachs estimate $4.81 a share on revenue of $8.31 billion. That stock is up going into the numbers. We're waiting on that. Ken -- it's great to have you this morning.</p><p>LEON: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Ken Leon joining us there.</p><p>Let's slip in a short break.</p><p>When we come back, former Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, Charles Plosser on trade uncertainty in the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Then the author of \"Resistance at All Cost\", the \"Wall Street Journal's\" editorial board member and one of really a hero for this show.

Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you regret being on the board to begin with?</p><p>HUNTER BIDEN, JOE BIDEN'S SON: No, I don't regret being on the board. What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea.</p><p>Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yes. But did I make a mistake based upon some unethical lapse? Absolutely not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hunter Biden said he will step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm at the end of the month as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign companies should his father win the White House.</p><p>A massive recall hits Taco Bell, 2.3 billion pounds of seasoned beef has been removed from restaurants in 21 states because it may have been contaminated with metal shavings.

AMC theaters becoming the first movie theater chain to enter the home entertainment business, launching a video on demand service that will be available to members of its customer loyalty program. AMC has a catalog of over 2,000 films that members can buy or rent. And of course you earn loyalty points so this also encourages you to actually go to the movie theater. So it's a win-win. You got to like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Yes. No, that's good.</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR IN CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: We have to leave our houses? What?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we have such great TV, so it's like, you know -- big set up.</p><p>BOLTON: And so many choices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Let's talk Hunter Biden for a second. Cabot -- your reaction. I mean just the fact that he says I'm not going to go on any foreign boards or, you know, have foreign relations if my father's president, is this an admission that it's improper.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes. It's tough to say -- look, there's no law (ph) saying there was nothing wrong with it. However, if my father's the president, I won't do it again. If there's nothing wrong with it then why not continue to do it?</p><p>And interesting point also, anything he is saying, Joe Biden, his campaign are giving him directly to say. That's the clear message. He's not saying this of his own will. I think this is clearly a message coming from the campaign.</p><p>Also important to point out what this does to Joe Biden as a candidate. This draws more attention to the fact that he and his family have benefited greatly from capitalism, from business. They've made millions of dollars from crony capitalism and that's something that is hugely unpopular right now with the electorate.</p><p>So you've got a lot of Democrat voters right now that are trying to run as far away as they can from wealth, from capitalism, saying it's evil to be rich. And now you have your main candidate and his family reaping the benefits of that same system.</p><p>This is going to be hurt him in the long run. This will certainly be used not just by President Trump politically speaking but also from other candidates. We're going to see it come up on the debate stage (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was going to ask you. You know, who pokes him about this tonight on the debate stage when they'll all going to be there -- 12 candidates tonight are going to face off for this next debate.</p><p>And you know, the fact that he traveled with his father, then a sitting vice president, on Air Force 2 when his father had official business in China and then came home and 10 days later gets this injection of $1 billion which turns into $1.5 billion from a Chinese state bank.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes. I think Biden's initial reaction was oh, it's just my kid, leave my kid out of it. He's a 49-year-old man. And when he's making this kind of money, it's no longer safe to say, well, there was no reaction there. If you're asking who you think is going to bring it up tonight on the debate stage, you obviously think Elizabeth Warren, given the attacks that she's made against other candidates, accusing them of cronyism, of capitalism also as well.</p><p>I don't know if she will. She's kind of gliding right now. I don't know if she wants to make an enemy with Biden because she's the rising, ascendant candidate right now. It might be one of the lower candidates trying to punch up to get Biden to react to them. But it will interesting to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Bernie yesterday came out and said, you know, Elizabeth Warren is a capitalist. Whoa. Ok.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Which probably actually is going to help her with Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, she's handled this campaign really well.</p><p>BOLTON: She has. I mean it's become a bit of a joke -- I have a plan for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: But people are responding to that. I mean I think she's not worth underestimating.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you one thing, the banks are quaking in their boots this morning if she is the candidate and if she does get the presidency.</p><p>BOLTON: Big tech as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Big tech and banks.</p><p>Bank earnings this morning is how we're focused on on the sector. Full swing -- Goldman Sachs expected out moments from now. We will have the number when we come. The stock is up 1.25 percent ahead of its quarterly numbers.</p><p>Then this, celebrating American made, the country's oldest brewery here on set later this hour. Don't miss it.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are looking ahead to the opening bell where we are expecting a triple digit rally at the start of trading. Dow futures right now up 103 points. We are getting better than expected earnings this morning.</p><p>The markets ended the session slightly lower yesterday. Investors still skeptical about that partial U.S.-China trade deal and whether issues over intellectual property will actually be addressed by the Trump administration.</p><p>We are also looking at better than expected earnings in the banking sector this morning. JPMorgan reporting a better than expected number as did Johnson &amp; Johnson and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, Charles Plosser. And Charles -- it is great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>Charles Plosser -- can you hear me? Looks like we have an audio problem for Charles Plosser. We're going to get back to him in a second.</p><p>And I what I really want to ask the former president of the Philly Fed is where are we in terms of the growth story. How much of this trade uncertainty is impacting overall growth and we know that the consumers is strong but is he seeing it as well? What's your take on where we are?</p><p>OTTER: Well, there's an interesting thing happening in markets right now which is that we are lowering interest rates and increasing spending 10 years into an expansion. That's extremely unusual.</p><p>Normally you see the deficit shrinking, you would see interest rates rising, and also people say the Fed is what pushes you into recession because the rates go too high.</p><p>We're seeing the opposite this time so does that mean we'll have the -- you know, the longest expansion on record will get even longer? Is he here?</p><p>So will the longer expansion than ever keep on going? This is what's called -- sorry to get geeky on you, it's called pro-cyclical stimulus. Because the stimulus is coming at the same time that the expansion continues. Very unusual -- it's really an experiment. We'll see how it ends.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see. Charles Plosser -- are you with us, former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve? Are you with us -- Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PLOSSER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF PHILADELPHIA FEDERAL RESERVE: Yes, I am -- Maria. Good to be with you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, terrific. Yes -- apologies for that issue with your audio. We're glad you're here.</p><p>What's your take on the growth story today for the U.S. economy? Taking into consideration this uncertainty that we're all talking about every day over trade policy.</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I think the basic signs for the economy are still pretty good. Yes, there's been some softening in manufacturing in particular because of the trade issues and the uncertainty. Consumers still seem to be holding up pretty strong. And so I think the economy's still doing ok.</p><p>But there remains a lot of uncertainty out there as we've all talked about and I don't think that uncertainty is going to go away very quickly but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, in terms of the Federal Reserve and what it can do here, you know, we've had two late summer rate cuts. The Fed expected to put in place yet another cut coming up in the next two weeks amid this potential global slowdown. you know, we're waiting to see if this is actually going to take effect.</p><p>I mean this is one criticism that what can the Fed do in the face of the trade uncertainty? Do you think the fed cutting rates is actually going to impact this -- Deirdre?</p><p>BOLTON: Honestly, I'd like to hear from our guest on that because I think, you know, the fact is, they're cutting rates at the same time that they're increasing liquidity, right. And that was a reference that our -- or a point that our guest from Stifel had made earlier. And he actually seems pretty optimistic on the next 12 months.</p><p>But to Jack's point -- I don't know that we've ever seen this before. An 11-year bull run and expansion at the same time that we're continuing to inject -- I'm not going to call it stimulus, but some flexibility into the system.</p><p>OTTER: I would call it stimulus. There's a lot of spending going on. And then the other question with low rates is, does one quarter point really make a big company say ok, now I can afford to build that new factory. Rates are so low right now. How much lower can they go.</p><p>BOLTON: I feel like for business leaders it always comes down to confidence, right. If they feel confident, then they spend and they invest and then they hire. And I think a lot of this U.S.-China trade war, what that has done for the past 18 months is just provide another element of instability.</p><p>I'm not saying it robs leaders of confidence but it gives them perhaps more pause than they otherwise would have taken. So in that way, I do think the Fed's cutting may mitigate some of those concerns or maybe some of that unwillingness to invest and hire.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're waiting on Goldman Sachs earnings. And that's going to give us a good window in terms of the banking sector. There was an event in London where the St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard, said that the American economy is slowing. He's calling for insurance rate cuts.</p><p>So do you want to get rate cuts in place before we actually see this slowdown, you know, deepen?</p><p>PLOSSER: So there's Rob Arnott is a really interesting guy. Runs a company that creates models for ETFs. And he makes that point that you can never see the recession coming before it gets there. And then what happens is the Fed always starts cutting when it's too late, like the recession is already on the way.</p><p>In fact often, he thinks they caused it by raising rates. So it's possible that maybe we did actually get ahead of it this time. That's the optimistic view.</p><p>BOLTON: That's the optimistic view. I'll take the other side just to be devil's advocate. The pessimistic view is we're cutting when we don't need to and when the recession arrives there's no more arrows in the quiver.</p><p>PLOSSER: I'm not going to argue with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a miss on Goldman Sachs. The earnings coming in at $4.79 -- we told earlier that the estimate was $4.81. And there's a lot behind these numbers. Let's go behind the headlines with Susan Li right now as the stock trades down on the Goldman Sachs third quarter earnings -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. So it looks like bottom line, they're a bit of a miss. But in terms of revenue numbers, it's pretty much in line. So $8 billion, $8.32 billion is what we got from the quarter, estimates are calling for 8.31. Pretty much in line.</p><p>Now, don't forget, that Goldman Sachs is a little bit different from JPM, more of an investment banking, pure play if you want to call it that. And they did see some positives in the quarter with revenues and equities, they say higher due to higher commissions and that reflects increased client activity because for a long time we were looking at stagnant trading in the markets just going one way.</p><p>But higher activity means more fees for Goldman Sachs. Tough quarter, though, for GS because they did have to write down their 1.4 percent stake in Wework, down by a quarter of a billion dollars.</p><p>They also had to write down according to analysts their stakes in Uber, Avantor (ph), Trade Web, Head Hunter group and those clients total of a quarter of a billion dollars as well</p><p>Not good investments so for Goldman Sachs. But I'll be interested to hear what they say about the partnership with the new Apple card. And how that's going on their earnings call.</p><p>Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We called it at the top of the show, this Wework situation is impacting things at JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs. Obviously, you're seeing a bigger hit here on Goldman Sachs with the numbers missing estimates.</p><p>BOLTON: And even that partnership that Susan just alluded to, chew with Apple and this Apple card, and our guest from CFRA was talking about Goldman's move, bigger footprint into retail banking for people, not institutions.</p><p>And I felt like that deal with Apple was one more way for Goldman to get data, for one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>BOLTON: And then for two, let itself be a little bit more known among average consumers and average bankers, normal main street people, not institutions.</p><p>OTTER: Another move they made in that exact same vein was to buy United Capital, which is an independent advisory firm. It's only $25 billion dollars under management. Not a big move for Goldman.</p><p>BOLTON: But part of that diversification.</p><p>OTTER: Exactly. And to the man on the street, you know, it's Morgan Stanley, it's not that man on the street -- it's a wealthy individual but they've done a brilliant job of just they decided at the time of the crash I think that was their future was the advisory business -- Goldman taking a little step in that direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Stock is down three quarters of a percent right now.</p><p>And we're back with Charles Plosser. He is the former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. Charles -- let me get your take on the health of the banking sector today. I mean obviously, these banks have more capital. They're holding more capital than they want to. But it has been a good thing when you look at the stress test.</p><p>Do you think we've overdone it in terms of the regulatory environment on the banks with regard to their capital rules?</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I think they clearly are more healthy. I think their capital is up and I think that's a good thing.</p><p>However, I do think that the regulatory environment has had some unintended consequences in the side effects of sort of a micro regulation that goes on, for liquidity and other things that the banks have to do.</p><p>And I think that regulation is part of the source of the problem we had in the repo market turmoil a couple, few weeks ago. And I think the fed needs to be looking at the plumbing and how their regulatory rules interact with the functioning of the markets, and particularly the money markets in particular.</p><p>So I think there's some issues that need to be resolved. I don't think just throwing more reserves at the banking system is going to solve the kind of problems that we have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you make a good point because that was that one night when, you know, rates in the repo market went from 2 percent to 10 percent overnight. There was not enough liquidity.</p><p>I mean a lot of people say that the fed should have seen this, there wasn't enough liquidity there. But you say it's just too stringent rules on the capital.</p><p>CHARLES PLOSSER, FORMER PRESIDENT, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF PHILADELPHIA: Well, part -- it's partly that. But it's the liquidity requirements and it's the fact that the large balance sheet the Fed's trying to operate in has undermined what used to be the Fed funds market, where banks traded funds with each other.</p><p>And that's not functioning much anymore because there's so many Fed funds out there that the banks really don't worry about trading it very much. I think that's contributed to the inability for reserves, which is what the Fed supplies, to move around in the marketplace and meet these shocks that come -- that come in.</p><p>So I think it's a combination of factors that are just throwing more reserves isn't going to solve the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's really great analysis from you on that, Charles. Real quick before you go, we have another Fed meeting in two weeks, it's I think it's 70 percent that the market thinks that we're going to get another rate cut.</p><p>Assess the backdrop for us, Charles. Is that warranted right now given the fact that we are looking at a 50 year low in unemployment and the consumer is where it is? But I know that CapEx spending has slowed down quite a bit and there's uncertainties around trade.</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I -- my own sense is that the Fed may very well cut rates again. I'm not convinced of that. I think it's far from a foregone conclusion. I think the problem is, is that, yes, CapEx spending has slowed and softened, partly due to the uncertainty.</p><p>But I don't think cutting rates is going to solve that problem. It's not going to make firms more confident about the future. It's not going to make -- get rid of the uncertainty and so I'm not sure it would have much effect, even if they did it.</p><p>So I think -- I think -- I don't think another cut is far from -- is far from a foregone conclusion at this point and markets might be surprised at the reaction of the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Charles, we want to apologize for any audio issues we had this morning. We hope you'll come back soon. Thank you, sir.</p><p>PLOSSER: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's good to see you, Charles Plosser. We'll be back with Kim Strassel from the Wall Street Journal. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our top story this half an hour, the high stakes whistleblower standoff, Congress returns from recess today. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expected to hold a closed door meeting on the Hill for an update on the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>President Trump's former Russia advisor Fiona Hill testifying in front of three House panels for nearly nine hours yesterday. Of course it was all closed doors.</p><p>Sources tell Fox News that she had high praise for the ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz getting the boot from the hearing because he is not on one of those committees that's conducting the investigation. Gaetz slammed the call last night on Hannity, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Today, Adam Schiff removed me as a member of the Judiciary Committee from the deposition he was taking. This is proof that Democrats can't win a fair election, they can't win a fair debate and they absolutely cannot run a fair impeachment inquiry because they're stacking the deck. They're doing everything they can to limit our access to witnesses and evidence. They're not allowing us to call witnesses.</p><p>And by the way, if Republicans had a witness list, it would be Adam Schiff who would be a fact witness because of the collusion that he was -- and his staff were engaged in with the whistleblower that they then lied about.</p><p>So look, we're going to keep fighting to get to the facts here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Fox News contributor, the Wall Street Journal editorial board member and the author of Resistance (At All Costs), author Kimberley Strassel. Kim Strassel, it is great to have you on the show this morning.</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It is great to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. You have done such an astute and fantastic job covering all of this, we are -- you really are our hero on this program. We talk about your op-ed every day, actually.</p><p>Tell me about your reaction to what is taking place now for us before we get into the book, in terms of this inquiry and all of these testimonies that are happening behind closed doors.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, we just saw it today; there are endless stories with leaks about what Fiona Hill said in this testimony yesterday. But we don't really know what she said because it's all being presented, again, behind closed doors and then you see Democrats spinning a narrative. This is really high stakes. It's impeachment. The American people deserve to see transcripts; they deserve to see what's going on so that they can make their own judgment about what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, you've covered the origins of the Russia investigation so well. This has been a story that I care about deeply.</p><p>STRASSEL: You've been great on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, because I feel like on any side of the aisle, you have to be upset when you see a cabal of people, whether from the FBI or the CIA, trying to put their finger on the scale and use the tools that we use for terrorists and you're just seeing more of this with this obstruction. What's your reaction to what's taking place?</p><p>STRASSEL: You just made a great point, which is that everyone should care about this deeply and there would have been a time when everybody did care about this deeply. Some of us still do.</p><p>But just being able to say the FBI started a counter-intelligence investigation into a sitting presidential campaign is an as astonishing statement. And then the more that we find out about how it actually did so and the abuse of power that was going on. We've already heard some of that from the I.G., don't take it from me. The inspector general has already put out a report on Comey and McCabe and made clear.</p><p>And this is the kind of damage I'm talking about in the book that people like to say Donald Trump is destroying institutions and democracy, but look at the loss of faith in the FBI and the DOJ. That is a result of folks who abuse their power and Americans say -- because they didn't like this president and it scares Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In the book you write that it's not just the left, the media has also jumped on-board and you've got the media driving the bus on this in terms of, you know, focusing on some things but not focusing on other things.</p><p>So, the media refuses to look at the origins of the Russia investigation, where we know that they inserted Donald Trump into the story of Russia meddling into the United States.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, no, I have a whole chapter on this, about all the ways that they lowered their standards to using anonymous sources. And you and I both know at least some of those have got to be the people that are accused of wrongdoing at this moment, but they present them as neutral, just running with false accusations. And what bothers me is I think we're seeing a repeat of this now with the Ukrainian story and which is why it's so important.</p><p>Look, America suffered through two years of the Mueller investigation, this hyped, what was a hoax in the end. And that was driven in large part by Democrats leaks and media being involved. I think we're seeing a repeat now. And it's why Americans need to be able to see the transcripts and see what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's not forget Brett Kavanaugh and what happened there, that's another part of this where you had resistance at all cost as you write so eloquently in the -- in the book, where these Trump haters did not want him to have any victory. And didn't the left spend 30 hours with Christine Blasey Ford to help her carve and shape her hearing and her testimony?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, and to get rid of due process along the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bingo.</p><p>STRASSEL: You know, and this is the thing, you go through the list. We have a broken Senate confirmation process because of this. We have the lowering and demeaning of impeachment standards because of this. We've got a judiciary that's engaged in all kinds of norm-breakings, national injunctions, right and left. This is a departure from anything we've had. New media standards being lowered and then lack of trust in the media, in our civil bureaucracy, in the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>This is because of the actions of people that got the impression that just because they didn't like Donald Trump that they were allowed to break any rules that they wanted to in their effort to get rid of him. And when you have a mentality like that, that's how you end up breaking like core and important things in the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And as you write, breaking America. It's just not right. And if you believe in our constitution, you should be outraged by what took place.</p><p>Now, we -- I gave an update last night on Twitter to say that the I.G. report now I'm hearing is going to be out at the end of the month, because they are still doing classifications. There's going to be a lot in the I.G. report, I initially thought it was going to come out this Friday, it's not coming out this Friday but -- because they're classifying things.</p><p>Do you think we're going to see accountability here? Do you think we'll see actual prosecutions and indictments for those people who tried to take Donald Trump down and used the tools that we use on terrorists like informants and like wiretapping?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, the thing I hope most of all is we simply see most of the report. You just mentioned the classification.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>STRASSEL: Don't forget, when you go back to when House Republicans were doing their investigation, the incredible foot dragging that went into this and how they just would not the -- like DOJ, FBI, all the intelligence agencies, they did not want to give up any information. So I hope we get the information.</p><p>And then I am, I am pretty confident we're going to get some accountability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about this book in terms of the most important piece of information that people need to take away from this book. Because there's so many legs to this story and you write all about it in the book. But give me your sense of what readers should take away with.</p><p>STRASSEL: You know, this is a chance to step back and take an objective view at the last three years and then talk about where the real damage is being done. And we all need to know that, especially as we go into an upcoming election season, about the real narrative here and what we risk in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And one of the real damages I think is the fact that our leadership, the FBI, the CIA, are not focusing on the real wrongdoing. I mean, when you talk about obstruction, am I wrong to say Hillary Clinton used a hammer and BleachBit to get rid of her e-mails?</p><p>STRASSEL: Yes, we have a double standard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that obstruction? Hello?</p><p>STRASSEL: And I talk to Americans, this is the most frustrating thing for them is that look at the story that we're having right now. Apparently it's perfectly OK for the Hillary Clinton campaign to funnel Russian information to the FBI, to be used against a presidential campaign but the president just calling the Ukraine is an impeachable offense? I mean, you can't have it both ways. And this is the frustration for many Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The same thing with Hunter Biden. Now Hunter Biden is breaking his silence, openly admitting to making a mistake in the Ukraine dealings. He was getting $50,000 a month from Ukraine. I mean, $600,000 while his father's a sitting vice president?</p><p>STRASSEL: And by the way, you know, people keep using the word corruption. Quite aside from corruption, the fact that Hunter Biden stepped down from that board is an admission that this just smells bad. It's a conflict of interest. He should never have been doing this when his father was vice president.</p><p>And I think that the Biden's essentially acknowledged that this week by his decision to step back and say I won't do it if my dad's president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's incredible that from the moment Donald Trump was inaugurated, the resistance movement was as strong as it was. But the resistance movement has only gotten worse. How do you think this president's legacy will go down in terms of how we look at this three-year period that you write so well about?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, I mean, again, it depends on how much damage ends up being done. Is there going to be an impeachment vote against him? Is that going to be the asterisk by his name?</p><p>But look, we've never seen anything like this before. Again, we all have the ability and the right to disagree with each other in politics. But it doesn't mean that you don't have to follow all of the kind of rules that we've set out about how you handle politics.</p><p>And so I think that there's going to be just as many history books written about the reaction to him as his actual governing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is an important book and it is an important history book. Because this actually happened as extraordinary as it sounds. You write and it's like, you know, you can't -- you can't write this but you did. And in closing, tell me in terms of what you want to see in terms of the wrong doers from the Russia probe. Do you think -- who do you think the mastermind of it was?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, look, all of the leadership of the FBI and then the outside groups too. Fusion GPS, by the way, we just heard they're going to put their own book out here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. And Jim Comey has his own book. I mean, your reaction to him going on T.V. and Andrew McCabe getting a job on CNN. I mean, he's had criminal referrals.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, this is unprecedented as well too. Not just the members of those communities are now acting as analysts, but it's also just one of the reasons people feel frustrated that there's no accountability is because they're being treated as heroes when in fact, you know, this guy was fired from the FBI, he's a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. Kim Strassel, get the book, the book is Resistance (At All Costs). We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The E.U.'s Brexit negotiator says a deal with the U.K. is still possible this week. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: All right, Maria. Michael Barnier says the main challenge now is to turn British proposals on the Irish border issue into legal text. E.U. leaders are meeting for a two-day summit this week as the October 31st deadline looms, 16 days away.</p><p>Britain's chief Brexit minister has also made a last minute trip to Luxembourg to meet with E.U. ministers. We'll see, clocks' ticking.</p><p>Pilots of Southwest Airlines don't expect the 737 Max jet to fly again until February at the earliest, that's later than Boeing's projection to return the planes back to the air before the end of this year. Southwest is the largest operator of the grounded jets. Its pilots union sued Boeing last week accusing it of deliberately misleading it about the planes. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Another headache for Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is, it continues to be. Lauren, thank you.</p><p>Coming up, America's oldest brewery in business for nearly two centuries. The women behind the brand. Join me on set as we celebrate made in America. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, we are toasting America's oldest brewery this morning. Yuengling celebrating 190 years of brewing right here in America. The company is producing 2.6 million barrels of beer every year, becoming America's number one craft brewery.</p><p>Joining us right now is Jen Yuengling, vice president of operations and Debbie Yuengling, employee engagement and culture manager. They are the sixth generation running this family business. And ladies, it is great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>DEBBIE YUENGLING, EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND CULTURE MANAGER, YUENGLING: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, we love family businesses here and we want to hear your story in terms of being of a year generations of being founders. And we also love made in America. Tell us about your business.</p><p>JEN YUENGLING, VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS, YUENGLING: Yes, thank you. So we are celebrating our 190th anniversary this year. Our brewery was founded in 1829 by our great-great-great-grandfather and my sister Debbie and other two sisters and myself; we are sixth generation family members.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's fantastic; you're two of four sisters who are running this operation. How is it Debbie to run -- being women in this male dominated industry and running the family business?</p><p>D. YUENGLING: It's very special for us, getting to work alongside your family, but I think also knowing the history that our generations have worked there before us, our grandfather are still there with my dad. The beer industry is typically male dominated. But it's something that we're persevering through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you -- how have you broken through in this male dominated industry?</p><p>J. YUENGLING: You know, I think what we're seeing is up to a third of brewers in the industry today are women. So we do have a partnership also with Pink Boots Society where they enable and they educate and empower women in the brewing industry. So I think that really resonates with us, a sixth generation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you -- go ahead, Jack.</p><p>JACK OTTER, EDITOR, BARRON'S: So, I'm interested because like Budweiser and Miller and those guys started dominating the industry and put a lot of the smaller guys like you out of business but then in the 80s you surged and you're like the original craft brewer. And now it seems like craft brewing is the thing and you guys are right on top of the wave. How did you start it?</p><p>J. YUENGLING: That's really accurate. I think when our father took over the brewery in 1985, he along with Jim Koch with Boston Beer and same items, they were almost the pioneers of that first craft beer revolution.</p><p>OTTER: And then now, you're just -- you're riding the wave, right? Are you national or just East Coast or?</p><p>J. YUENGLING: We are -- we're in 22 states. So we kind of joke internally. It's taken us 190 years to get in the -- to get into 22 states. But, you know, I think we survived through innovation. Our Lager brand, number one and then also our recent collaboration with Hershey.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, yes, tell us about the collaboration with Hershey's. Because you got a gigantic Hershey's bar here, my favorite chocolate bar by the way and the porter beer with the Hershey's. What is this?</p><p>D. YUENGLING: Yes, so we were super excited to partner with Hershey's, an iconic chocolate company. Its 45 minutes from the brewery. We're both in Pennsylvania. So we came up with this collaboration. Our Dark Brewed Porter is one of our original beers, we've -- that's almost 200 years old. So it's a great combination with the dark malt, very delectable taste to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>OTTER: Both calories in that glass.</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: So, the first beer I ever had was a Yuengling. So you guys always have a special place in my heart.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, wow.</p><p>PHILLIPS: A lot of millennials, upcoming generations maybe a little less like in the past generations to be beer drinkers as a first choice. What are you guys doing to market to them and to shift to their needs?</p><p>J. YUENGLING: You know, well, I think the innovation that we have right here with our Yuengling Hershey chocolate porter is you know, it's really hitting millennials. And it's for all legal drinking age consumers. It's more of an upscale, premiumize type beer, so you can see the chalices that we have in front of us here. Great chocolaty malt aroma and overtones in both the flavor and the aroma profile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How cool, a chocolaty aroma. Where do you -- where do you produce?</p><p>J. YUENGLING: So we produce -- and we have two breweries in Pottsville, Pennsylvania which is centrally located in P.A. and then we also have a brewery in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Ladies, thank you so much. Congratulations to you.</p><p>D. YUENGLING: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to have you. Check out Yuengling the new porter beer there. We will see you soon, Jen and Debbie Yuengling.</p><p>Stay with us, we've got breaking news, and Hunter Biden's son breaking his silence. We'll talk about that when we come back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019101502cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-KV71-DXH2-63JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Tech companies are increasingly the focus of Trump administration investigations, with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission looking closely at antitrust issues. Perhaps sensing a bigger fight brewing, Amazon  AMZN, -1.79%[1] , along with Facebook Inc.  FB, -1.41%[2] and Apple Inc.</p><p> AAPL, -2.94%[3] , ramped up their lobbying to record levels in 2019, with Amazon spending $16.1 million. Read: Facebook, Amazon and Apple set records for annual spending on lobbying[4]  The issue has been a persistent one for Amazon, with GlobalData Retail saying that a 2018 revenue slowdown[5] at the e-commerce giant could poke holes in the talk of a monopoly. Other onlookers as far back as 2017[6] suspected that government intervention could be imminent.  But in an election year, the sour relationship between Amazon, Jeff Bezos and President Trump could heighten. #8216;We expect the antitrust rhetoric to reach deafening levels during this presidential election year, while Amazon's relationship with the White House remains the most precarious within Big Tech,#8217; analyst Brian White wrote in a note. Monness Crespi Hardt rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,250 price target. See: Do growing calls for antitrust action threaten the S&amp;P 500 index as the 2020 election nears[7]  President Trump has singled out Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Twitter because of Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post[8] and with claims that the U.S. Postal Service[9] was losing money on Amazon e-commerce package deliveries. Trump ordered a review of the USPS's finances, but not much has been said on the topic for some time.  The Post Office had blamed the U.S. government, and not Amazon, for its losses.  More recently, Amazon blames Trump for losing the $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure plan, or JEDI, contract with the Pentagon. JEDI instead went to Microsoft Corp.  MSFT, -1.67%[10] in October[11].  Amazon has filed a lawsuit over the contract. Also: Opinion: What Amazon is really accusing Trump of doing in JEDI deal[12]  Amazon is scheduled to announced fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday after the closing bell. D.A. Davidson analysts led by Tom Forte say they'll be listening on the call for comments about this appeal. The JEDI contract is #8216;what we consider to be the company's biggest loss since its inability to secure government support of its New York City HQ2,#8217; analysts said. D.A. Davidson thinks there are two factors that will help Amazon in the antitrust fight: the company's investments in shipping, which would position it to #8216;break the duopoly#8217; between FedEx Corp.  FDX, -3.62%[13] and United Parcel Service Inc.UPS, -1.49%[14] in the U.S.; and its growing advertising business, which will snap the stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on that category. #8216;[These are] excellent arguments for Amazon on its efforts to promote more competition, which should provide protection against an increasingly hostile global regulatory environment for big technology, including Amazon,#8217; analysts wrote. D.A. Davidson rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,550 price target. Amazon has an average buy rating and average target price of $2,196.27, according to 50 analysts polled by FactSet. Here are some other things to look for in Amazon earnings:  Earnings: FactSet is guiding for earnings per share of $4.05, down from $6.04 last year. Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects EPS of $4.53. Amazon has missed the FactSet EPS consensus the last two quarters. Revenue: FactSet is guiding for revenue of $86.03 billion, up from $72.38 billion the previous year. The Estimize outlook is for $85.66 billion. Amazon has beat the FactSet consensus the last four quarters. Stock price: Amazon stock has gained nearly 10% over the last year while the S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -1.57%[15] is up 22.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA, -1.57%[16] is up 15.8% for the period. Don't miss: Which tech stock is best? Here's how the #8216;big five' companies stack up as they report earnings[17]  Other items:  -One-day shipping is going to be bigger than analysts think. #8216;We expect another record revenue holiday quarter, which could eclipse the high end of guidance thanks to share gains from the impressive, aggressive, one-day shipping rollout,#8217; wrote Benchmark analysts in a Monday note. Amazon has already said the holiday season was #8216;record breaking,#8217;[18] though, as usual, it didn't provide sales numbers to back that up. That there will be margin pressure because #8216;let's face it, one-day delivery is expensive,#8217; Benchmark said. But they say, as other analysts have[19], that the pressure is worth it.  Amazon has said it would spend more than $800 million[20] to make one-day shipping happen.  Benchmark rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,300 price target. Watch: Here's how much speedy delivery really costs[21]  -SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts think the shift to one-day shipping is #8216;underappreciated#8217; in current estimates. #8216;[W]e believe the company can actually sustain, and potentially accelerate its top-line growth, given the impact to-date on unit growth, and what we observed in 2005 onward following the launch of free two-day shipping,#8217; analysts wrote. Free two-day shipping for Prime members was launched in 2005, and the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years was 5%, analysts say. #8216;Overall, we view this set up positively, and believe top-line outperformance in the retail business will drive the stock's outperformance in 2020,#8217; SunTrust said. SunTrust rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,350 price target.The post Earnings Outlook: Amazon earnings preview: Antitrust chatter will pick up ahead of presidential election[22] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[23].

Using a sample of CEO turnovers from 1993 to 2016 we show that the likelihood and speed of forced CEO turnover - but not voluntary turnover - are higher when analysts exclude income-decreasing items. The association between exclusions and forced turnovers is particularly pronounced for high magnitude exclusions. We also show that greater street exclusion of income-decreasing items, the lower CEO bonus payouts. We find that boards use audited and more conservative GAAP earnings in evaluating and dismissing CEOs, except in the recent period of 2010-2016.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Income items excluded by analysts from reported earnings - street exclusions - are used in boards' CEO dismissal decisions.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Boards have also used the less value-relevant, but more conservative, GAAP EPS in compensation decisions until recent years.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Results suggest that, in guiding analysts, managers traded-off higher stock prices with a higher dismissal risk.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Earning-based measures are unrelated to dismissal decisions from 2010 when SEC tightened scrutiny of non-GAAP disclosures.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The evidence is indicative of a recent decline in the usefulness of GAAP earnings for internal decision-making.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FULL TEXT</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref5b0185\"/>The statutory purpose of financial statements is to provide decision-useful information to investors, lenders and creditors (<link><marker>FASB, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>). <link><marker>Kothari et al. (2010)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0300\"/></link> provide a more nuanced view by arguing that the principal role of the income statement is to measure firm performance for contracting, particularly with management, whereas the balance sheet primarily serves a stewardship role. Although firms are required to prepare income statement numbers using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), many analyst focus on a different performance measure colloquially known as 'street' earnings. These are analyst-adjusted measures of GAAP earnings that are also regularly tracked in commercial databases. Street earnings typically do not include certain non-recurring expense items that reduce reported profit (henceforth, street exclusions). Analysts and investors largely rely on street earnings rather than GAAP earnings (<link><marker>Bradshaw and Sloan, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kolev et al., 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ford, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0335\"/>A number of papers examine the relationship between CEO turnover and firm performance (e.g., <link><marker>Murphy and Zimmerman, 1993</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>; <link><marker>Engel et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bhagat and Bolton, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link>; <link><marker>Jenter and Kanaan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ghosh and Wang, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0205\"/></link>). Although this literature finds consistently that CEO turnover is inversely related to firm performance, the relation is not strong (<link><marker>Brickley, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>). A second strand of literature considers the persistence and relevance of non-recurring items that analysts often exclude from reported earnings for stock pricing (<link><marker>Bradshaw and Sloan, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link>; <link><marker>Burgstahler et al., 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Doyle et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>; <link><marker>Marques, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dechow et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link>).5<link><marker>Bushman et al. (2006)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link> and <link><marker>Banker et al. (2009)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link> provide theoretical arguments supported by empirical evidence from compensation data that the greater the value relevance10 of a performance measure, the greater its pay-performance sensitivity. The results reported in <link><marker>Bushman et al. (2006)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link> and <link><marker>Banker et al. (2009)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link> therefore suggest little role in CEO performance evaluation for street exclusions because analysts disregard them.15<link><marker>Black et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link> find that a small fraction of firms that use non-GAAP performance measures internally in compensation contracting also disclose these measures in earnings announcements. This finding suggests firms may be using different performance measures in internal communications vs. external communication. Consistent with this empirical insight, several papers have argued that measures used in stock market valuations could (and should) differ from measures used in internal decisions (<link><marker>Gjesdal, 1981</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>; <link><marker>Paul, 1992</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bushman and Smith, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>; <link><marker>Wagenhofer, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kothari et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0300\"/></link>). This suggests that even though street exclusions are not value relevant, they may still be used internally. In other words, one set of papers suggests that because street exclusions are valuation irrelevant, they should also be discounted by boards when deciding on CEO dismissals. On the other hand, other papers distinguish between value relevance and relevance for internal decision making. The implication is that street exclusions can (and should) be used internally, if they provide information about the quality of the CEO.</p><p>In this paper, we examine which set of the arguments discussed above is supported in the context of CEO retention decisions, because little is known whether numbers that are used by market participants, or GAAP numbers, are more relevant for internal corporate governance purposes, especially CEO retention decisions. Specifically, we contribute to this literature by examining whether the likelihood of a CEO dismissal is related to the exclusions that are largely ignored by analysts and investors for valuation purposes.</p><p>Our empirical results are derived from the intersection of ExecuComp, Compustat, CRSP, and I/B/E/S databases for the period from 1993 to 2016. Using a comprehensive sample of 2635 CEO turnover events of which 716 are classified as forced turnover, our logistic regressions and proportional hazard analyses indicate that the likelihood and speed of forced CEO turnover - but not voluntary turnover - are positively related to street exclusions and, more generally, to GAAP earnings. The positive relation between street exclusions is stronger the larger the magnitude of analysts' exclusion of income-decreasing items. We obtain these results after controlling for a variety of factors, including a firm's pre-turnover performance, firm-specific characteristics, and governance variables. Therefore, the results suggest that the earnings measure used in CEO retention decisions (GAAP earnings) differs from the performance measure used by external parties for valuation purposes (street earnings).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0055\"/>We conduct several additional analyses to better understand this finding. First, although street exclusions are a measure based on analyst data provider information (such as I/B/E/S), they are possibly influenced by managers who routinely communicate with analysts. Managers can voluntarily disclose a closely related earnings measure, which is commonly known as non-GAAP earnings.20 Like street earnings, non-GAAP earnings tend to exclude income-decreasing items, but managers decide what is excluded. This voluntary disclosure has risen in recent years although it was much less common in the earlier years of our sample. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that communications from managers, either privately (in earlier years) or publicly (more recently), shape street earnings and analyst forecasts. One concern regarding such communications is that they are used opportunistically. In response to this concern, in March 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced Regulation G, which restricts what managers can exclude from GAAP earnings; it establishes that only non-recurring items can be excluded.25 The SEC has further increased its attention to non-GAAP in 2010 when it issued a new set of Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&amp;DIs) (<link><marker>Black and Christensen, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link>). If the SEC interventions caused analysts to focus on non-recurring items when calculating street earnings, street exclusions may have become less value relevant after the introduction of Regulation G. We thus explore whether the relation between the magnitude of street exclusions and CEO turnover is driven by the pre-Regulation G period. We find evidence of a significant relation between forced CEO turnover and street exclusions also post-Regulation G period but not in the C&amp;DI period. This may be related to <link><marker>Lev's (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link> argument that the usefulness of reported earnings has rapidly deteriorated particularly during the recent 2-3 decades. While it is premature to make any definite claim, the pattern we document is alarming because the primary role of earnings is to reflect performance.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0200\"/>To further shed light on the role of street exclusions in the broader context of CEO performance evaluation, we run a third set of analyses applied to CEO bonus payouts. <link><marker>Gaver and Gaver (1998)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link> provide evidence that CEO cash compensation is shielded from the effects of above the line losses. In contrast, we find that street exclusions are significantly associated with CEO bonus, a finding that holds in both pre- and post-Regulation G periods, but not in the C&amp;DI period. Taken together, our results suggest that boards use GAAP earnings in evaluating and disciplining CEOs and do not ignore the less valuation-relevant street exclusions with the exception of the most recent period.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0025\"/>One important contribution of this study is to show that when balancing between the potentially more value-relevant street earnings and the (typically) more conservative GAAP earnings, boards tend to rely on the latter. One possible explanation is that street exclusions, particularly large ones, are seen as a signal about future managerial performance because they contain information about past investment underperformance. Consistent with this \"underperformance hypothesis\", we provide evidence that street exclusions are primarily attributable to special items (that contain various types of asset write-offs). This result can also explain why CEOs avoid timely write-offs (<link><marker>Bartov et al., 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0025\"/></link>; <link><marker>Alciatore et al., 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0005\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hirschey and Richardson, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0255\"/></link>; <link><marker>Jarva, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>; <link><marker>Li and Sloan, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link>). CEOs seem to face a trade-off between applying GAAP in a timely and unbiased manner to avoid costly scrutiny (<link><marker>Hazarika et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>), and protecting their CEO position by delaying recognition of losses. Moreover, while guiding analysts to exclude reported losses can attract more internal scrutiny and thus increase the chance of a dismissal, this practice helps keep stock prices high, which is beneficial for managers' stock of their company's equity instruments. Managers therefore balance the dismissal risk against the wealth benefit of guiding street exclusions. There are two additional, but not mutually exclusive, explanations to our results. First, it is possible that boards, like analysts, understand that street exclusions in themselves are relatively unimportant. Still, we would expect to statistically establish a significant relation between dismissals and street exclusions, if exclusions are correlated with adverse private information that boards observe, but analysts (and researchers) do not. Second, using more conservative and reliable numbers-rather than the higher street earnings-likely helps boards gain legitimacy when making difficult retention decisions and deflect criticisms of their action.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Determinants of CEO turnover</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0375\"/>There is an extensive literature on the determinants of CEO turnover, which for brevity we succinctly summarize here. This literature documents the retention roles of accounting and stock return performance (e.g., <link><marker>Weisbach, 1988</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0375\"/></link>; <link><marker>Murphy and Zimmerman, 1993</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>; <link><marker>Jenter and Kanaan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ghosh and Wang, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0205\"/></link>), industry-related factors such as homogeneity and competition (<link><marker>Parrino, 1997</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>; <link><marker>DeFond and Park, 1999</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>), internal and external monitoring mechanisms (e.g., <link><marker>Goyal and Park, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0225\"/></link>; <link><marker>Huson et al., 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>; <link><marker>Parrino et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bhagat and Bolton, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link>), firm-CEO matching (<link><marker>Eisfeldt and Kuhnen, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>) and accounting irregularities and earnings management (<link><marker>Leone and Liu, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0305\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hazarika et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0015\"/>Both market-based and accounting-based performance measures are associated with CEO-retention decisions. <link><marker>Engel et al. (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link> show that boards weigh accounting variables relatively more if they are measured more accurately. They also show that accounting variables become more retention relevant as stock prices become more variable and hence noisier for performance valuation purpose. This evidence extends similar findings from the compensation literature. Agency theory establishes that multiple performance indicators should be used in optimal contracting, as long as they are not perfectly correlated and in inverse relation to their precision (<link><marker>Banker and Datar, 1989</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>; <link><marker>Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>; and <link><marker>Baker et al., 1994</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>). In addition to performance measures that are observed externally, boards may rely on variables that are only internally available (<link><marker>Hayes and Schaefer, 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>). Therefore, the externally observed performance measures that we examine here (e.g., street exclusions) could appear retention relevant in our analysis-not only because they are directly relevant to boards, but also because they are incrementally informative over other internally-observed variables.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.2. Street vs. GAAP earnings</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0195\"/>The literature on street earnings establishes several relevant findings. <link><marker>Bradshaw and Sloan (2002)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link> report that the difference between GAAP earnings and street earnings has increased over time. They also show that managers \"encourage\" analysts to focus on the (higher) street earnings.30<link><marker>Bradshaw and Sloan (2002)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link> provide evidence that this effort is successful in that markets seem to respond to street earnings rather than GAAP earnings. This evidence is intriguing because experimental evidence (<link><marker>Frederickson and Miller, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>) suggests that professional investors are not misled by street earnings that are higher than GAAP earnings. Instead, owing to cognitive bias, unsophisticated investors may over-value street earnings. <link><marker>Bhattacharya et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link> provide empirical evidence that further supports this conjecture.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0045\"/>Managers prepare and communicate non-GAAP earnings (also known as pro forma earnings) with increased rates over time. Non-GAAP earnings are conceptually separate from street earnings because the former originate from managers and the latter are produced by analysts. Managers' definitions of non-GAAP earnings need not be identical to analysts' definition of street earnings (<link><marker>Bhattacharya et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>). Yet, <link><marker>Bradshaw (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0070\"/></link> notes that in 65% of the cases, pro forma earnings and street earnings are identical and that the two measures are highly correlated.35 More recently, <link><marker>Doyle et al. (2013)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link> review the process by which I/B/E/S, managers and analysts communicate and reach a similar conclusion. <link><marker>Bentley et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link> is the first to provide large-sample evidence about the differences and similarities between managers' non-GAAP reporting and I/B/E/S's street earnings. Their evidence shows that managers' non-GAAP reporting agrees with I/B/E/S's street earnings 78.9% of the time. Taken together, this evidence suggests that analysts' formation of the measure of street earnings used in forecasts is shaped by managers' communication of alternative earnings measures. However, while analysts have produced street earnings for many years, pro-forma earnings appear in a much lower frequency and are not available for researchers in commercial databases such as Compustat.</p><p><link><marker>Black et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link> examine the consistency with which non-GAAP earnings are used internally, for compensation purposes, as well as externally to communicate with markets. They report that firms disclose non-GAAP earnings, either in the earnings announcement or proxy statement in about 50% of their sample. Only in 11% of the cases non-GAAP earnings appear in both statements. This suggests a small overlap between the use of non-GAAP in external communication and internal compensation decisions. They do not explore how non-GAAP earnings and exclusions from GAAP earnings influence CEO turnovers.40</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0030\"/>It is important to recognize that communications between managers and analysts, either publicly through the release of non-GAAP measures, or through private channels, may be opportunistic because managers attempt to outperform these expectations. Several papers (e.g., <link><marker>Bartov et al., 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Isidro and Marques, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link>; <link><marker>Guillamon-Saorin et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>) provide evidence consistent with \"expectations management.\"</p><p>Our paper aims to explore whether the performance measures that parties external to the firm (i.e., analysts) use for valuation purposes are used in internal retention decisions. We are motivated by the tension between the arguments that suggest that a performance measure that is more value relevant is also used more heavily in evaluating CEOs (<link><marker>Bushman et al., 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link>, and <link><marker>Banker et al., 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>) and the arguments that this need not be the case (<link><marker>Gjesdal, 1981</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>; <link><marker>Paul, 1992</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bushman and Smith, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>; <link><marker>Wagenhofer, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kothari et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0300\"/></link>).45</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.3. Hypothesis development</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0355\"/>There is practically no evidence as to which earnings metrics affect turnovers, and only a handful of papers feature in the compensation literature upon which we can draw. <link><marker>Gaver and Gaver (1998)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link> show that nonrecurring gains flow through compensation but losses do not. This suggests that managers are shielded from recognizing one-time losses. More recent evidence confirms this finding but also suggests that boards exclude special items from compensation contracts for financially distressed firms (<link><marker>Potepa, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link>). <link><marker>Banker et al. (2009)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link> do not distinguish between recurring and non-recurring income items; rather, they show that boards rely more heavily on GAAP earnings than operating cash flows if earnings are also more value relevant. However, we acknowledge that the evidence from the compensation literature may not carry over fully to retention decisions for at least two reasons. First, firms' compensation committees typically set compensation contracts, while dismissal decisions are performed by boards whose responsibilities are broader (e.g., strategic decisions, communication with shareholders, etc.). Second, compensation contracts are explicitly written on observable numbers, but CEO retention is based more on an implicit contract between the board and the CEO. Nevertheless, the basic idea that boards should consult performance measures that are also used externally seems plausible in the context of dismissal decisions.</p><p>From a legal perspective, a manager can be fired without cause, which is often the case when boards lose trust in the former's ability to run the firm.50 Therefore, the option to dismiss a CEO without cause means that boards are free to rely on any performance measure (or a combination of measures) that they consider relevant. Hence, unlike compensation contracts, GAAP earnings do not carry any particular <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">legal</emphasis> significance for a termination decision. From a theoretical perspective, the choice of a performance measure is determined by its accuracy and correlation with unobservable managerial ability and effort (see, <link><marker>Engel et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>). In making retention decisions, the board therefore may be particularly interested in street earnings because they are informative as to how sophisticated agents outside the firm view its performance.</p><p>However, boards may have a different view than investors about the accuracy and value relevance of street earnings. First, such disagreement may arise because street earnings are not audited while GAAP earnings are. Second, in dismissal decisions conservative boards likely prefer conservative performance measures. To the extent that street earnings provide a rosier picture of performance, when dismissing the incumbent CEO, boards may legitimize their decisions by referring to a lower performance measure that appears reliable and objective. This, in turn, helps boards defend against potential criticism (e.g., in the press, by analysts and possibly shareholders) and appear unbiased. More broadly, whether GAAP earnings are more indicative of CEO ability than street earnings in the eyes of boards remains an open question. Therefore, our null hypothesis is as follows:<br/>: Street exclusions are unrelated to the likelihood and speed of forced CEO turnover.</p><p>Our second hypothesis relates to regulatory interventions by the SEC. In 2003 and following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July 2002, the SEC put into force Regulation G, which concerns the measurement and voluntary reporting of non-GAAP earnings. This regulation requires firms that disclose non-GAAP earnings to provide a clear reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP earnings and prohibits the exclusion of recurring income items from non-GAAP earnings.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0250\"/>In an early study, <link><marker>Marques (2006)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link> documents that market reactions to items excluded from GAAP earnings in non-GAAP earnings are similar before and after Regulation G, which suggests that this regulation is ineffective.55 In a sample covering the post-regulation period, <link><marker>Doyle et al. (2013)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link> find evidence indicating that firm managers calculate non-GAAP earnings opportunistically to meet or beat analysts' expectations (which are based on street earnings). In a closely related study, <link><marker>Heflin and Hsu (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link> find evidence suggesting that managers use non-GAAP earnings to generate good performance perceptions to a lesser extent after the regulation is enacted. <link><marker>Kolev et al. (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link> find that exclusions are more transitory following Regulation G. Interestingly, in recent years (and under more stringent regulation) the voluntary disclosure of non-GAAP earnings has increased significantly.60</p><p>Although street earnings and non-GAAP earnings are produced by different agents, Regulation G and C&amp;DI may have affected analyst-produced street earnings by focusing their attention on non-recurring items. If post-regulatory intervention analysts exclude more non-recurring items than before, boards may also disregard street exclusions to a greater extent following stringent regulations. On the other hand, if boards use GAAP earnings to legitimize dismissal decisions, the retention-relevance of GAAP earnings is expected to remain the same. Therefore, whether the disclosure regulation changes have changed the retention relevance of street exclusions in the eyes of boards is an empirical question. We present our second hypothesis in null form:<br/>: Street exclusions are unrelated to the likelihood of forced CEO turnovers in different sub-periods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.

First, because exclusions affect analyst earnings forecasts, we control for revisions in analysts' earnings estimates (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For_Rev</emphasis>), which refer to the last consensus forecast during the fiscal year minus the consensus forecast three months after the end of the previous fiscal year scaled by the lagged stock price.65 We decompose stock returns into idiosyncratic and industry components (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Idio</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Peer</emphasis>, respectively) because <link><marker>Jenter and Kanaan (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link> argue that boards of directors should ignore the components of firm performance that are caused by factors beyond the CEO's control.

The next two variables, the CEO's share ownership (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Owner</emphasis>) and a dummy variable indicating whether the CEO is also the board chair (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Dual</emphasis>) are our firm governance-related measures. Finally, we include year and industry indicators (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">year effects</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">industry effects</emphasis>, respectively) to control for possible time and industry effects, respectively. Full details on the definitions of these variables are provided in the Appendix.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2. Time-to-turnover model</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0265\"/>As an alternative to Model 2, we examine the likelihood of CEO turnover using Cox proportional hazard model estimation (see e.g., <link><marker>Hazarika et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>). Unlike logistic regression, the Cox proportional hazard model explicitly accounts for the right-censoring that is prevalent in survival (or duration) time data. Specifically, sample censoring occurs because the follow-up period ends at the end of 2016, before all cases of CEO turnover occur. A second more important difference is that the dependent variable is the number of years that the CEO is in office. The Cox proportional hazard model can be expressed as follows:<br/>(3)  <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000135409291199v56sCS092911991830169Xmainstripinsi3\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>where h(t) is the hazard rate; x(t) is the same vector of time-varying covariates as in the logistic model; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis></emphasis> is a vector of parameters to be estimated. The hazard function in (3) is the product of two functions. The function <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">h</emphasis><sub>CEO turnover</sub>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>) characterizes how the hazard function changes as a function of survival time, while the other function, exp[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis></emphasis><sup>\u2032</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis></emphasis>], characterizes how the hazard function changes as a function of subject covariates (<link><marker>Hosmer Jr. and Lemeshow, 1999</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>). All independent variables are the same as those in the logistic model, so we do not repeat them here.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3. Determinants of exclusions</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0150\"/>In order to understand what may influence street exclusions, we use two approaches to provide evidence regarding which income statement items analysts exclude from GAAP earnings. First, following <link><marker>Doyle et al. (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link> and <link><marker>Kolev et al. (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link>, we simply decompose exclusions into special items and other exclusions. Second, we use the earnings decomposition framework of <link><marker>Donelson et al. (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link> to develop a model that estimates normal and abnormal exclusions. The dependent variable is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis>, and the explanatory variables are expense line items in the income statement, including the cost of goods sold (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">COGS</emphasis>); sales, general and administrative expenses (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGA</emphasis>); depreciation and amortization (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Depr</emphasis>); tax expenses (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tax</emphasis>); special items (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis>); and all other expenses (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other</emphasis>). All the variables are deflated by the beginning-of-period market value of equity. Eq. (4) is estimated for each industry based on the Fama and French 48-industry classification. Specifically, our measure of normal (abnormal) exclusions is the fitted (residual) value from the following cross-sectional model:<br/>(4)  <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000135409291199v56sCS092911991830169Xmainstripinsi4\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Sample and descriptive statistics</emphasis></h><p>Our data come from four sources: ExecuComp for CEO data, the Center for Research on Securities Prices (CRSP) for stock returns data, Compustat for accounting data, and I/B/E/S for analyst data. We first identify all cases of CEO turnover for the sample period from 1993 to 2016.70 In line with prior research (e.g., <link><marker>Engel et al., 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>; <link><marker>Eisfeldt and Kuhnen, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>), we record a turnover event if the CEO identifier (i.e., the executive who holds the annual CEO flag) in year t is different from the CEO identifier in year t-1. The new CEO may prefer to report low earnings in their first year to shield future income. Therefore, consistent with <link><marker>Hazarika et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>, we exclude the CEOs who serve only an interim period (i.e., less than a year) in office to minimize any influence from earnings \"big-bath\" on our results. Following prior research, we eliminate utilities (SIC 4400-4999) and financial (SIC 6000-6999) industries. We also eliminate firm-year observations with insufficient data to compute the primary variables used in our tests.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0180\"/>Identifying whether a CEO's departure is forced or voluntary requires an inspection of press releases because forced turnover is often presented as retirement. Using a hand-collected sample of press releases, we classify each CEO turnover event as forced or voluntary based on information in the related news announcement. Specifically, following prior studies (<link><marker>Parrino, 1997</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>; <link><marker>Huson et al., 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>; <link><marker>Fich and Shivdasani, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bushman et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0105\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hazarika et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>), turnover is classified as forced if (i) the CEO retires or resigns under questionable circumstances or the company fires, demotes, or forces the CEO out of the position (e.g., due to policy differences); (ii) the departing CEO is younger than 65 and the announcement does not report the reason as death, poor health, or the acceptance of another position75; or (iii) the CEO retires but leaves the job within six months of the retirement announcement and does not take a comparable position elsewhere.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90005\"/>Our final sample contains 26,571 firm-year observations from 1993 to 2016. Of the total sample of 2635 CEO turnovers, 716 (27.2%) are forced. The sample size compares favorably with that of the recent study of <link><marker>Eisfeldt and Kuhnen (2013)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>. <link><marker>Table 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90005\"/></link> reports the distribution of these observations over the years. The results show that the number of observations varies over time and that the average turnover rate is 10.0% for all firm-year observations implying an average CEO tenure of 10\u202fyears. However, in the more recent period since 2010, total CEO turnover have somewhat increased.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90005\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"200\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference90005\"/>Year</entry><entry>Number of observations</entry><entry>Number of turnovers</entry><entry>Forced turnovers</entry><entry>Forced as a % of total turnovers</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>1993</entry><entry>667</entry><entry>71</entry><entry>13</entry><entry>18.3%</entry></row><row><entry>1994</entry><entry>918</entry><entry>93</entry><entry>17</entry><entry>18.3%</entry></row><row><entry>1995</entry><entry>955</entry><entry>85</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>41.2%</entry></row><row><entry>1996</entry><entry>992</entry><entry>84</entry><entry>27</entry><entry>32.1%</entry></row><row><entry>1997</entry><entry>1021</entry><entry>89</entry><entry>26</entry><entry>29.2%</entry></row><row><entry>1998</entry><entry>1073</entry><entry>110</entry><entry>21</entry><entry>19.1%</entry></row><row><entry>1999</entry><entry>1088</entry><entry>115</entry><entry>31</entry><entry>27.0%</entry></row><row><entry>2000</entry><entry>1081</entry><entry>95</entry><entry>31</entry><entry>32.6%</entry></row><row><entry>2001</entry><entry>1043</entry><entry>87</entry><entry>18</entry><entry>20.7%</entry></row><row><entry>2002</entry><entry>1075</entry><entry>97</entry><entry>31</entry><entry>32.0%</entry></row><row><entry>2003</entry><entry>1106</entry><entry>91</entry><entry>21</entry><entry>23.1%</entry></row><row><entry>2004</entry><entry>1126</entry><entry>132</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>24.2%</entry></row><row><entry>2005</entry><entry>1080</entry><entry>102</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>31.4%</entry></row><row><entry>2006</entry><entry>1051</entry><entry>93</entry><entry>27</entry><entry>29.0%</entry></row><row><entry>2007</entry><entry>1182</entry><entry>133</entry><entry>46</entry><entry>34.6%</entry></row><row><entry>2008</entry><entry>1322</entry><entry>108</entry><entry>29</entry><entry>26.9%</entry></row><row><entry>2009</entry><entry>1323</entry><entry>85</entry><entry>26</entry><entry>30.6%</entry></row><row><entry>2010</entry><entry>1305</entry><entry>140</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>28.6%</entry></row><row><entry>2011</entry><entry>1262</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>45</entry><entry>37.5%</entry></row><row><entry>2012</entry><entry>1237</entry><entry>131</entry><entry>28</entry><entry>21.4%</entry></row><row><entry>2013</entry><entry>1211</entry><entry>144</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>22.2%</entry></row><row><entry>2014</entry><entry>1199</entry><entry>171</entry><entry>46</entry><entry>26.9%</entry></row><row><entry>2015</entry><entry>1146</entry><entry>129</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>23.3%</entry></row><row><entry>2016</entry><entry>1108</entry><entry>130</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>24.6%</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Total</emphasis></entry><entry>26,571</entry><entry>2635</entry><entry>716</entry><entry>27.2%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 1 - Frequencies of CEO turnovers.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90010\"/><link><marker>Table 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90010\"/></link> and <link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link> present the means and standard deviations of GAAP earnings per share (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis>), non-GAAP earnings per share (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis>) and the exclusion of GAAP earnings per share during the year (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis>) for each year in the sample period. The mean value of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis> is lower than the mean value of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> in all years except in 1994 and 1995. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis> is negative in 2002 (the dot.com crisis) and 2008 (the great financial crisis), but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> is positive in all years. The standard deviations of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> move in tandem. The mean values for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> are negative in 22\u202fyears out of 23. It also evident that mean values of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> has become more negative over time. For example, the average exclusion from 1993 to 1997 is \u22120.005, whereas the average for 2012-2016 is \u22120.023. This finding is consistent with analysts' exclusion of income-decreasing items, a trend that increases during our sample period. Untabulated statistics reveal that GAAP and street EPS differ by at least one (ten) cent(s) for 85.6 (56.5) percent of the sample. At least a one-dollar difference can be found for 24.3% of the sample. In sum, the magnitude of street exclusions is substantial relative to GAAP earnings, especially during financial-turmoil periods.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000135409291199v56sCS092911991830169Xmainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000135409291199v56sCS092911991830169Xmainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - GAAP earnings versus street earnings.

from performance measures of voluntary and no turnover sub-samples. <link><marker>Table 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90015\"/></link> shows that observations with forced CEO turnover are associated with poorer performance in the year before forced turnover than in other two groups. Specifically, in the forced turnover subsample, mean and median values of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street, Ret_Idio</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Peer</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MTB</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGR</emphasis> are significantly lower than those in the control sample. The mean (median) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> is \u22120.034 (\u22120.003) for forced turnovers, compared to \u22120.022 (0.000) for voluntary turnovers and\u202f\u2212\u202f0.016 (0.000) for the no turnover sample. In other words, firms that dismiss their CEOs have significantly more negative street exclusions than firms whose CEOs leave voluntarily or firms that do not change CEOs. Firm governance variables (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Age, CEO_Owner,</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Dual</emphasis>) are also significantly different between the sub-samples. On average, the CEOs in the forced turnover sub-sample are younger, hold less equity and have lower CEO-chairman duality rates compared voluntary turnovers. In sum, turnover firm-years differ from non-turnover firm-years along several performance dimensions; they are associated with lower GAAP earnings, lower stock returns, greater returns volatility, lower growth expectations, younger CEOs and stronger CEO power (as measured by CEO-chairman duality).<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90015\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"10\"

voluntary CEO turnover to performance measures.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0365\"/>In Model (2), street earnings replace GAAP earnings as the main variable of interest. The results for Model (2) in <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link> show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> also has a significant negative relation to forced CEO turnover in the subsequent year. An untabulated <link><marker>Vuong (1987)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link> test shows that Model (1) is significantly better in explaining forced turnovers than Model (2). In Model (3), we include both street earnings and street exclusions-the sum of which is GAAP earnings. Both are negatively related to the incidence of forced turnover, which is consistent with the results of Model (1), as both components add up to GAAP earnings. Model (3) thus confirms that both street exclusions and street earnings are similarly associated with turnover.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0085\"/>For forced CEO ousters, an inspection of the control variables suggests that firms with greater return volatility are more likely to change the CEO. The (untabulated) odds-ratio is highest for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Std_Ret,</emphasis> followed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_GAAP</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Idio</emphasis>. Size, growth opportunities and leverage, as measured by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LogMVE, SGR, MTB</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LEV,</emphasis> play no role in forced turnovers. Consistent with <link><marker>Bhagat and Bolton (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link>, forced turnover is less likely if the CEO holds a greater equity stake. Finally, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Dual</emphasis>, a measure of CEO power, is not significantly associated with turnovers. The lack of significance may be explained by <link><marker>Brickley et al. (1997)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link>, who argue that it is not theoretically obvious which leadership structure is best. Finally, the coefficient on CEO age is negative in the forced sub-sample but positive in the voluntary sub-sample. This result is consistent with the findings of <link><marker>Engel et al. (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>. This indicates that older CEOs tend to resign, whereas boards regard age as a positive personal trait (because it is likely correlated with experience), so they do not tend to dismiss older executives.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90030\"/>We next assess the effect of our variables of interest on the duration of CEO employment using time-to-event analysis, as outlined in Eq. (3). We employ the Cox proportional hazard model. Note that a positive coefficient implies a larger hazard rate or a shorter \"survival\" rate. Structured in a similar way to <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link>, <link><marker>Table 6</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90030\"/></link> reports the results of this analysis. Model (1) confirms that higher GAAP earnings are associated with longer service periods. The coefficient for street earnings on a standalone basis is insignificant in Model (2), implying this external measure of performance, on its own, is unrelated to forced turnovers. The results in Model (3) again suggest that boards use both street earnings and exclusions in CEO turnover decisions because both are significantly negative at the 1% level.

Specifically, we reject H1 as we find that GAAP earnings and street exclusions are associated with CEO turnover. In particular, street exclusions of expenses are associated with a higher probability of forced CEO turnover and shorter service periods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.2. Regulatory changes</emphasis></h><p>In this section, we provide evidence pertaining to our second hypothesis. Recall that the 2003 Regulation G likely focused analyst attention on non-recurring items. Against this background, Panel A of <link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link> does not provide compelling evidence that the gap between GAAP earnings and street earnings has progressively decreased since Regulation G was introduced. Next, we repeat the analysis conducted in <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link> to examine whether our results differ by time period. If street exclusions become less valuation relevant after Regulation G, we expect to find that their association with forced turnover is weaker than that before 2003. Therefore, we re-run Model (3) in <link><marker>Table 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90020\"/></link>, but we now allow the coefficients of interest to vary between the pre- and post-Regulation G periods (i.e., 1993-3/2003 vs. 4/2003-2016).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90035\"/>Panel A of <link><marker>Table 7</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90035\"/></link> provides the results for two different time periods. The results show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> continue to be significantly and negatively related to forced turnover in both Pre-Regulation G and Post-Regulation G periods, albeit with lower magnitude and significance in the post-Regulation G period. As a result, we reject Hypothesis 2 that street exclusions are unrelated to forced CEO turnover decisions in different sub-periods. The coefficient on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> is marginally significant in the pre-Regulation G period but highly significant in the post-Regulation period. Because GAAP earnings are the sum of street earnings and street exclusions, this evidence suggests that GAAP earnings play an important role in both periods (also confirmed by untabulated tests).<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90035\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"112\"/><thead><row><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col1\"><anchor id=\"reference90035\"/>Panel A_ Pre-Regulation G period (1993-3/2003) vs. post-regulation G period (4/2003-2016)</entry></row><row><entry morerows=\"1\">Variable</entry><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Pre-Regulation G period</entry><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">Post-Regulation G period</entry></row><row><entry>Forced</entry><entry>Voluntary</entry><entry>Forced</entry><entry>Voluntary</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.979 (0.097)</entry><entry>\u22120.114 (0.827)</entry><entry>\u22121.229 (0.003)</entry><entry>0.091 (0.782)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22121.377 (0.005)</entry><entry>\u22120.141 (0.748)</entry><entry>\u22120.734 (0.056)</entry><entry>\u22120.209 (0.464)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For_Rev</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22121.314 (0.175)</entry><entry>\u22121.520 (0.046)</entry><entry>0.421 (0.580)</entry><entry>\u22121.397 (0.011)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Idio</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.621 (0.000)</entry><entry>\u22120.300 (0.006)</entry><entry>\u22120.789 (0.000)</entry><entry>\u22120.252 (0.006)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Peer</emphasis></entry><entry>0.447 (0.106)</entry><entry>\u22120.070 (0.709)</entry><entry>0.004 (0.990)</entry><entry>\u22120.163 (0.424)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Std_Ret</emphasis></entry><entry>3.917 (0.001)</entry><entry>0.833 (0.352)</entry><entry>2.063 (0.051)</entry><entry>1.950 (0.008)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LogMVE</emphasis></entry><entry>0.123 (0.021)</entry><entry>0.127 (0.000)</entry><entry>\u22120.006 (0.878)</entry><entry>0.060 (0.013)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MTB</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.084 (0.153)</entry><entry>0.013 (0.745)</entry><entry>\u22120.018 (0.696)</entry><entry>\u22120.046 (0.160)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGR</emphasis></entry><entry>0.099 (0.628)</entry><entry>\u22120.182 (0.321)</entry><entry>\u22120.295 (0.218)</entry><entry>\u22120.377 (0.023)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LEV</emphasis></entry><entry>0.578 (0.134)</entry><entry>0.559 (0.047)</entry><entry>\u22120.021 (0.942)</entry><entry>\u22120.112 (0.552)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Age</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.074 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.124 (0.000)</entry><entry>\u22120.115 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.121 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Owner</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.294 (0.308)</entry><entry>\u22120.028 (0.640)</entry><entry>\u22120.069 (0.000)</entry><entry>\u22120.097 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Dual</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.078 (0.582)</entry><entry>\u22120.001 (0.991)</entry><entry>\u22120.005 (0.965)</entry><entry>0.097 (0.160)</entry></row><row><entry>Year indicators</entry><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Yes</entry><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">Yes</entry></row><row><entry>Industry indicators</entry><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Yes</entry><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">Yes</entry></row><row><entry>Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup></entry><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">12.22%</entry><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">11.00%</entry></row><row><entry>Cases of turnover</entry><entry>250</entry><entry>679</entry><entry>466</entry><entry>1240</entry></row><row><entry>Firm-years</entry><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">10,038</entry><entry nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">16,533</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 7 - How regulation changes affected CEO turnover-performance sensitivity?</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0110\"/>We further analyze the post-Regulation G period, distinguishing between 4/2003-2009 and the C&amp;DI period of 2010-2016. We report in Panel B of <link><marker>Table 7</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90035\"/></link> that both (neither), street earnings nor exclusions are related (unrelated) to forced CEO turnovers in the first (second) period.80 One possible explanation for this surprising finding is related to the deterioration in the usefulness of GAAP reporting for both investors and executives that has accelerated in recent years (<link><marker>Bushman et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0110\"/></link>; <link><marker>Lev, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>). This trend may explain both why managers resort more frequently to non-GAAP in recent years (<link><marker>Ford, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>) and the increased enforcement of non-GAAP. Our finding could be therefore picking up this recent \"breakdown\" in financial reporting, which in turn, may have caused boards to increasingly rely on non-earnings measures (GAAP or otherwise). An interesting question for future research is whether this phenomenon is a temporary in nature or a more permanent development.</p><p>An inspection of the control variables indicates that-for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Idio</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Age</emphasis>-the effect is the same in all periods. However, for a few control variables, the sign or significance level changes. For example, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Std_Ret</emphasis>, becomes insignificant after 2003, whereas <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Owner</emphasis> becomes negative and significant after 2003.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.3. Determinants of street exclusions and their association with CEO turnover</emphasis></h><p>The analyses above indicate that street exclusions are used in CEO retention decisions, with the exception of the most recent period. In this part of our investigation, we seek to provide evidence on the determinants of analysts' exclusions. Recall that street earnings tend to exclude income-decreasing items from GAAP earnings (as <link><marker>Table 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90015\"/></link> indicates), which implies that certain expense types are associated with street exclusions. However, I/B/E/S does not provide a precise formula as to what analysts exclude for each firm-year. Instead, we follow a statistical approach as outlined in Eq. (4) whereby exclusions are regressed on a number of expense line items in the income statement.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref90040\"/>Panel A of <link><marker>Table 8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90040\"/></link> reports the descriptive statistics for these line items. All variables are deflated by the beginning-of-period market value of equity. The largest expense item is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">COGS</emphasis> (with mean value of \u22121.038), followed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGA</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Depr</emphasis> (mean values are \u22120.258 and \u22120.059, respectively). The smallest expenses are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TAX</emphasis>. Although small in magnitude, special items represent accounting charges that are not expected to reoccur and are related to losses recognized in the current period with respect to past investments. The implication, therefore, is that they are indicative of managerial investment skill and talent. Panel B reports the results of the estimation of Eq. (4) by Fama-French 48 industry groups to control for normal exclusions in each industry. The findings indicate that the exclusions strongly relate to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis> and, to a much lesser extent to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other</emphasis>. The mean (median) coefficient estimate of 0.968 (0.885) indicate that an almost one-to-one mapping exists between exclusions and special items. The model explains on average about 40.7% of the variation in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis>. While this result indicates a good explanatory power for the model, it also suggests that the source of exclusions relates to other factors, so exclusions are not identical across firm-years.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90040\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"6\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"304\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\" colwidth=\"48\"/><thead><row><entry nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col1\"><anchor id=\"reference90040\"/>Panel A_ Descriptive statistics (N\u202f=\u202f26,571)</entry></row><row><entry>Variable</entry><entry>Mean</entry><entry>Std.</entry><entry>P25</entry><entry>Median</entry><entry>P75</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">COGS</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22121.038</entry><entry>\u22121.038</entry><entry>\u22121.038</entry><entry>\u22121.038</entry><entry>\u22121.038</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGA</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.258</entry><entry>\u22120.258</entry><entry>\u22120.258</entry><entry>\u22120.258</entry><entry>\u22120.258</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Depr</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.059</entry><entry>\u22120.059</entry><entry>\u22120.059</entry><entry>\u22120.059</entry><entry>\u22120.059</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tax</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.023</entry><entry>\u22120.023</entry><entry>\u22120.023</entry><entry>\u22120.023</entry><entry>\u22120.023</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.019</entry><entry>\u22120.019</entry><entry>\u22120.019</entry><entry>\u22120.019</entry><entry>\u22120.019</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.021</entry><entry>\u22120.021</entry><entry>\u22120.021</entry><entry>\u22120.021</entry><entry>\u22120.021</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col1\">Panel B_ Summary statistics of the cross-sectional estimates</entry></row><row><entry>Estimate</entry><entry>Mean</entry><entry>t-value</entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry><entry>Median</entry><entry>Std.</entry></row><row><entry>Intercept</entry><entry>\u22120.002</entry><entry>\u22120.25</entry><entry>(0.807)</entry><entry>0.005</entry><entry>0.050</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">COGS</emphasis></entry><entry>0.002</entry><entry>0.22</entry><entry>(0.825)</entry><entry>\u22120.008</entry><entry>0.054</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGA</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.063</entry><entry>\u22121.07</entry><entry>(0.289)</entry><entry>\u22120.005</entry><entry>0.382</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Depr</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.201</entry><entry>\u22121.05</entry><entry>(0.300)</entry><entry>\u22120.024</entry><entry>1.253</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tax</emphasis></entry><entry>0.115</entry><entry>1.46</entry><entry>(0.151)</entry><entry>0.197</entry><entry>0.517</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis></entry><entry>0.968</entry><entry>18.04</entry><entry>(0.000)</entry><entry>0.885</entry><entry>0.352</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other</emphasis></entry><entry>0.208</entry><entry>4.00</entry><entry>(0.000)</entry><entry>0.200</entry><entry>0.342</entry></row><row><entry>Adj.

First, we explore whether the turnover event is more sensitive to unusual (or abnormal) exclusions because boards may view abnormally high exclusions more cautiously (i.e., as less informative). We estimate abnormal exclusions using the residual obtained from the regression reported in Panel B. Therefore, normal exclusions are estimated using the regression line. Model (1) of Panel C reports the results of this procedure. Both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Normal_Exclusions</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Abnormal_Exclusions,</emphasis> are negatively related to forced CEO turnover. Second, since exclusions are closely associated with special items, the likelihood of CEO turnover may be higher when exclusions are special items. We test this assertion in Model (2), reported in Panel C. Specifically, we divide exclusions into two components: special items (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis>) and other exclusions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Other Exclusions</emphasis>). The results indicate that both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SI</emphasis> and other exclusions are negatively related to CEO turnover. This result, combined with the previous analyses, indicates that boards do not shield CEOs from the consequences of reporting large special items when making dismissal decisions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.4. Bonus compensation and street exclusions</emphasis></h><p>Our finding that street exclusions are associated with forced turnover events is consistent with the notion that boards regard street exclusions as an internal performance measure, even if market participants may not use it for valuation purposes. Boards also use performance measures to set executive compensation schemes and reward good performance. Therefore, we examine whether street exclusions are associated with cash bonuses. It is reasonable to expect that CEOs' bonuses are based on the same earnings measures that boards use when replacing CEOs, because bonuses are designed to set targets for a CEO and a CEO will eventually be replaced if these targets are not met. Therefore, we regress the logarithm of one plus the cash bonus on the same independent variables as those used in the previous models, but the independent are not lagged.85 We investigate the relation between bonus and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS</emphasis>_<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Street</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> by estimating the following Tobit regression from our data:<br/>(5)  <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000135409291199v56sCS092911991830169Xmainstripinsi5\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p><anchor id=\"ref90045\"/>The results of estimating the Tobit and OLS models are reported in <link><marker>Table 9</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90045\"/></link>. We find results similar in nature to those reported for CEO turnover in Model (3) in <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link>. In the Tobit model both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> are significantly and positively related to the bonuses paid to CEOs in the current year. Because the coefficient for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> is positive and exclusions are, on average, income decreasing, the implication is that the greater the magnitude of expense exclusions, the lower the current year's bonus. The tenor of the results is unchanged when we estimate an OLS regression that includes CEO-firm fixed effects. The coefficient on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis> is 0.543 while the coefficient on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> is 0.741. An (untabulated) F-test fails to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are equal (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value\u202f<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">=</emphasis>\u202f0.369). We also repeat this analysis for the three sub-periods in the spirit of <link><marker>Table 7</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90035\"/></link>. Untabulated results confirm that the above relations between street EPS and street exclusions hold in the first two sub-periods, but not in the C&amp;DI period. Therefore, we conclude from these analyses that boards also do not ignore street exclusions when designing bonus schemes for CEOs with the exception of the most recent period.90<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90045\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"112\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference90045\"/>Variable</entry><entry>Tobit model</entry><entry>OLS model</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS_Street</emphasis></entry><entry>1.438 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.543 (0.006)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis></entry><entry>1.545 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.741 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For_Rev</emphasis></entry><entry>4.759 (0.000)</entry><entry>2.044 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Idio</emphasis></entry><entry>0.807 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.342 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ret_Peer</emphasis></entry><entry>0.423 (0.001)</entry><entry>0.327 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Std_Ret</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22121.328 (0.017)</entry><entry>\u22120.368 (0.246)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LogMVE</emphasis></entry><entry>0.362 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.336 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MTB</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.156 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.003 (0.873)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SGR</emphasis></entry><entry>0.556 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.574 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LEV</emphasis></entry><entry>\u22120.227 (0.170)</entry><entry>\u22120.743 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Age</emphasis></entry><entry>0.003 (0.497)</entry><entry>\u22120.248 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Owner</emphasis></entry><entry>0.118 (0.000)</entry><entry>0.022 (0.005)</entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CEO_Dual</emphasis></entry><entry>0.003 (0.954)</entry><entry>\u22120.230 (0.000)</entry></row><row><entry>Year indicators</entry><entry>Yes</entry><entry>Yes</entry></row><row><entry>Industry indicators</entry><entry>Yes</entry><entry>No</entry></row><row><entry>CEO-Firm indicators</entry><entry>No</entry><entry>Yes</entry></row><row><entry>Firm-years</entry><entry>26,571</entry><entry>26,571</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 9 - Are street exclusions related to CEOs cash bonus?</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.5. Additional robustness tests</emphasis></h><p>We conduct several additional tests to verify the robustness of our results to alternative specifications and control for potential omitted variables. For brevity, we do not tabulate the sensitivity tests but they are available upon request.</p><p>First, we examine a potential non-linear relation between street exclusions and turnover. This analysis is motivated by the view that small to moderate exclusions may be ignored or overlooked by boards. Specifically, we categorize <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> into quintiles and create indicator variables to represent each quintile. We then re-estimate our multinomial Model (3) of <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link> using these indicator variables. As expected, forced turnover sensitivity is significant in two most negative exclusions group. Moreover, the sensitivity of turnover to exclusions monotonically declines in the quintile rank. These findings suggest that large negative exclusions lead boards to discipline CEOs faster. We also delete positive exclusions and re-estimate the model using a sample of only negative exclusions; the tenor of the results is similar.</p><p>CEOs compensation schemes may also influence CEO turnover decisions. We examine whether the relation between street exclusions and turnover is different between firms that emphasize relatively more short-term vs. long-term incentives. We compute a ratio of the sum of salary and bonus to total compensation for each CEO-firm observations. A larger (smaller) value of this ratio indicates that a CEO's compensation scheme is designed to provide more short-term (long-term) incentives. We divide the sample into two groups based on the median value of this ratio. The coefficients on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS</emphasis>_<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Street</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> remain negative for the long-term incentives sub-sample while only the coefficient on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> is negative in the short-term incentives sub-sample (untabulated). A possible explanation for this finding is that \"myopic\" boards are likely to stress more current poor performance (captured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis>) than persistent earnings (captured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EPS</emphasis>_<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Street</emphasis>).</p><p>We noted earlier that the dot.com crisis in the early 2000s and the great financial crisis of 2007-2008 may be exceptional years. Our first robustness test therefore is to exclude 2001, 2007 and 2008 from the sample and rerun our tests. After excluding these years, we find our results remain qualitatively unchanged.</p><p>One concern regarding our findings is that street exclusions may be influenced by manipulative and opportunistic communications from managers. If boards are aware of this possibility, they would have a strong reason to use GAAP earnings. If the manipulation of analysts' perceptions of street earnings is more common among managers who manipulate reported numbers, we need to verify that our results are not driven by these manipulative firms and managers. To do so, we add an indicator of adverse restatements, a proxy for manipulations, from the AuditAnalytics database to the models explored in <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link>. The results remain the same as we find that our results are similar for manipulating and non-manipulating firms.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0215\"/>It is possible that both poor GAAP earnings and the need to dismiss a CEO are driven by an omitted correlated variable. One plausible candidate for this underlying force is the strength of board monitoring. Weak monitoring can lead to both poor performance and eventually the need to oust the CEO. We therefore also examine whether the effect of exclusions on forced CEO turnover is affected by governance quality. Using the G-index data of <link><marker>Gombers et al. (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link>, we add two indicator variables to our main multinomial model.95 Untabulated results reveal that both low and high G-index indicators are insignificant to predict turnovers. Importantly, even with this limited sample <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exclusions</emphasis> continues to be robust in explaining the likelihood of forced turnovers.</p><p>Another possible omitted variable is managerial talent. This is supported by the view that ability drives both performance and boards' assessment of the fit of the CEO with the firm. We therefore re-estimate our models after explicitly controlling for the effect of managerial ability.100 Untabulated results show that voluntary turnovers are marginally more likely for CEOs having a higher ability, but insignificant in predicting forced CEO turnovers. Thus, street exclusions contain information not captured by managerial ability scores. We also introduce into the model several other control variables, but our results remain similar.105</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0275\"/>Our variables are deflated by the lagged share price. To the extent that markets anticipated price turnovers, this deflation may affect our inferences. Share prices tend to decrease prior to turnover and subsequently increase (see, for example, <link><marker>Huson et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0275\"/></link>). Hence, our deflated performance measures are likely larger for turnover firm-years and lower for other firm-years. While this works against finding a negative relation between the performance measures in question and subsequent CEO dismissal, we use an alternative deflator. Specifically, we use the average total assets per share and find that the results reported in <link><marker>Table 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90025\"/></link> are qualitatively the same.</p><p>We have followed prior literature in the classification of turnovers between forced and voluntary. We therefore conduct a placebo test to rule out the possibility that our findings are driven by the misidentification of relevant turnover events. In previous analyses we excluded CEO turnovers due to death (140 observations). As a placebo test, we include these cases and estimate a multinomial model in which the dependent variable identifies whether there was turnover (as originally defined), turnover due to death, or no CEO turnover in a given firm year. The results show that CEO's age is significantly positively associated with the probability of CEO's death. Importantly, our accounting performance measures do not predict CEO turnovers due to death.</p><p>In our analyses, we control for numerous firm and CEO characteristics. However, unobservable firm characteristics may still drive our results. Hence, to ensure that our results are not driven by correlated omitted variables, we re-estimate our models after controlling for firm fixed effects using two different approaches. First, we estimate a linear probability model using OLS and include firm fixed effects in our models. Second, we estimate a conditional logistic regression with firm fixed effects. Unlike the OLS fixed effects model, conditional logistic regression use only information from those firms that ousted their CEO at least once during the sample period. Results from both approaches are similar to our main results (untabulated). Specifically, that forced CEO turnovers, but not voluntary turnovers, are significantly related to street exclusions and street earnings. We therefore conclude that our results are not driven by some unobserved time-invariant firm characteristics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Summary</emphasis></h><p>Financial analysts often compute a measure of earnings, namely street earnings, that differs from reported earnings and use it in assessing a firm's performance and valuation. Street earnings typically exclude non-recurring expenses and losses from reported GAAP earnings. We investigate whether street exclusions that analysts disregard are also disregarded in boards' CEO retention decisions. If boards place great importance on the market's view of firm performance, street exclusions should be unrelated to retention decisions. However, we find that the likelihood and speed of CEO turnover are significantly related to street exclusions. Importantly, this result holds for forced turnovers but not for voluntary turnovers confirming the idea that exclusions are used by boards (although in combination of other elements of GAAP earnings). The result also holds before and after Regulation G (years 1993-3/2010), but not in the C&amp;DI period (4/2010-2016). Finally, in a similar vein, we show that street exclusions affect CEO bonus payouts. These findings suggest that in communicating with analysts, managers trade-off a higher exposure to board scrutiny of failure against maintaining a high stock price, which benefits their equity holdings. Our findings also suggest that managers who delay the reporting of write-offs also reduce the dismissal risk. However, this may increase the odds of punitive enforcement action by the SEC and shareholders (<link><marker>Hazarika et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>).</p><p>As a final note, the lack of findings for the post-C&amp;DI period is intriguing. We encourage future research to study whether the role of GAAP earnings in CEO retention decisions have permanently disappeared.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Appendix

Second, we want to examine how an EPS metric produced by professionals (namely, I/B/E/S), and used by investors, is associated with forced CEO turnover decisions.</p><p><link><marker>Kolev et al. (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link> and <link><marker>Heflin and Hsu (2008)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link> provide evidence that manager-disclosed exclusions are more transitory, infrequent, and smaller in magnitude following the introduction of Regulation G.</p><p>In the same vein, <link><marker>Bowen et al. (2005)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0065\"/></link> provide evidence that managers stress more favorable non-GAAP metrics in press conferences.</p><p><link><marker>Christensen et al. (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> reach a similar conclusion: exclusions from street earnings vary from firm to firm, and they are strongly influenced by what managers exclude from their pro forma earnings. Analysts' incentives to co-operate with managers may explain this finding (<link><marker>Lim, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link>).</p><p>Their sample spans the 2009-2015 period, and is therefore much smaller than ours.</p><p>Prior literature does not contrast earnings measures reported by firms and those used by analysts and in the context of CEO turnover.</p><p>See, for example, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis>, \"How to Fire a CEO,\" 30 October 2006.</p><p>Consistent with this assertion, the SEC has been concerned about compliance with Regulation G for some time and has published several guidelines and clarifications since 2003, including the most recent set published in May 2016.</p><p>Some estimates indicate that the percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies disclosing non-GAAP earnings increased from 72% in 2009 to 90% in 2016 (<link><marker>Ford, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>).</p><p>It can also serve as a proxy for the board's expectations (<link><marker>Farrell and Whidbee, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>), or managerial guidance.</p><p>We begin our sample period in 1993 because data on the ExecuComp variable CEOANN (which indicates whether the executive served as CEO for all or most of the indicated fiscal year) are available from 1993.</p><p>Many papers use the age of 60\u202fyears as a threshold.</p><p>This finding also holds for CEO bonus payouts. Specifically, untabulated analysis shows that street earnings and street exclusions are significantly positive in pre- and post-Regulation G periods but not in the C&amp;DI period.</p><p>Our assumption is that variables affecting the retention decision also affect annual bonus schemes. Therefore we use the same independent variables as in the turnover model.</p><p>This result is in contrast to <link><marker>Gaver and Gaver (1998)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link>. Their sample consists of 376 firms between 1970 and 1996 and they estimate firm-specific regressions which may explain differences in findings.</p><p>We download governance index data from Andrew Metrick's webpage (<url normalizedValue=\"http://faculty.som.yale.edu/andrewmetrick/data.html\">http://faculty.som.yale.edu/andrewmetrick/data.html</url>). This data is available for years 1993, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. Larger G-index is associated with lower governance quality. Following <link><marker>Hazarika et al.

Financial results from the calendar second quarter showed earnings for S...00  SPX, -0.14%[1] components falling for the second consecutive quarter, a trend referred to as an earnings recession. Profits dropped 0.35% in the second quarter, based on companies that were in the index as of the end of the previous earnings season, following a 0.29% decline in the first quarter.  See more: We are in an earnings recession, and it is expected to get worse[2]  A MarketWatch analysis of FactSet data found that five large companies were the biggest contributors to the earnings recession across the first half of the year: Apple Inc.</p><p> AAPL, -0.14%[3] , Boeing Co.  BA, -0.46%[4], Exxon Mobil Corp.  XOM, 0.29%[5], Facebook Inc.  FB, -0.49%[6] and Micron Technology Inc.  MU, -0.53%[7] .The reasons for each company's profit downturn vary, suggesting that the earnings recession cannot be blamed on any one trend that stretches across sectors. Boeing swung to a steep loss in the second quarter due to the grounding of its 737 Max jets for safety reasons, after two deadly crashes. In addition to taking a financial hit as those planes went out of service, the company announced that it would incur greater production costs for these aircraft. Boeing ultimately reported a net loss of $3.3 billion in the second quarter[8] after it posted a $1.9 billion profit a year earlier, making it the biggest contributor to the decline in the second quarter.  See also: Boeing to see $5.6 billion hit on 737 Max groundings[9]  Weakness in oil prices and across business lines helped drive down Exxon Mobil's profits for the second quarter, a trend the company expects once again as it prepares to release its third-quarter report. Exxon reported 'decade-low chemical earnings[10]' in its last report, according to a Raymond James analyst, while overall earnings tumbled 34%. While Exxon's earnings drop wasn't the largest within the energy sector, the market-cap weighting of the S...00 means that the company's results have a sizable impact on the index's overall earnings performance. For example, Noble Energy Inc.  NBL, -0.68%[11] suffered a 158% drop in earnings for the second quarter, but its result had a comparably minor effect on S...00 profits. Exxon is nearly 30 times the size of Noble. Apple suffers from a similar issue: While it hasn't been the worst earnings performer within the troubled technology hardware and storage subsector, the company's gigantic profit totals meant that a 16.4% profit drop in the first calendar quarter of the year was the biggest contributor to the S...00's decline in that period. Apple's earnings dropped 14.7% overall in the first half of the calendar year, as its strategy of selling ever-more-expensive smartphones faced increased pressure in the latest iPhone cycle, compounded by geopolitical tensions with China.  Opinion: Apple iPhone event reveals a dramatic change in strategy [12]  Facebook and Micron's earnings slips underscore other problems dogging Big Tech. Facebook absorbed a $5 billion fine[13] in the first half of the year related to a Federal Trade Commission settlement, with the charge split between the first quarter[14] and the second[15]. Though that charge was a one-time issue, the company's regulatory challenges aren't going away[16], and Facebook also faces increased costs as it tries to beef up the safety and security of its platform, a growing problem for social-media players.  Micron's earnings have remained under pressure amid a chip inventory glut[17] that's driving down memory prices, after the cost of memory chips spiked in 2018 and sharply boosted Micron's profit in the previous year. Micron's earnings declined more than 50% in each of the first two quarters of the year, and it has already pushed the S...00 toward a third consecutive quarter of declines by posting a drop of more than 80% late last month[18]. Read: Semiconductor stocks are poised to benefit as industry sales growth resumes in 2020[19]  Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect an even steeper earnings drop heading for third-quarter earnings results, which begin to flood in this week. Facebook is the only one of the five big contributors that is projected to post a profit increase in the third quarter. Overall earnings for current S...00 components are projected to fall 4.88%. While earnings for S...00 companies have declined this year, stock prices have not. The S...00 has gained 18.5% so far in 2019, while all five of the largest contributors to the earnings recession have also risen so far this year, ranging from a 1.5% increase for Exxon to a 49.5% gain for Apple.The post Earnings Watch: 5 prominent U.S. companies are most at fault for the earnings recession[20] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[21].

A quarter of the S...00 index  SPX, -0.39%[1] is set to report results in the coming week, along with a dozen Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA, -0.95%[2] components, more than a third of the index. Following this rush of numbers, investors will have a better sense of whether the S...00 will likely remain in an earnings recession, which occurs if the index[3] sees average earnings fall for at least two straight quarters. </p><p> Read: 5 prominent U.S. companies are most at fault for the earnings recession [4]  Tesla  TSLA, -1.92%[5] looks likely to see year-over-year revenue decline in its first quarter and its third consecutive unprofitable quarter, despite selling a record number of cars[6]. Investors will be looking for positive free cash flow, a forecast for profit or any signs that Tesla is on a path to profitability, or at least that demand is still strong for Tesla's cars. After Tesla announced its third-quarter delivery total, formerly bullish JMP Group analysts downgraded the stock to 'hold' and said it was 'the first time since covering the stock that we found ourselves wondering whether demand growth for (Tesla's) cars might be leveling off.'  Chief Executive Elon Musk will attempt to counter that notion while attempting to get production started in China and prepping for the launch of the Model Y. An RBC analyst believes Tesla might move up that mid-SUV \u2014 which is expected to start production late next year \u2014 to help jolt growth.  Full preview: Tesla is about to show investors if it's back on the road to profitability[7]  Boeing  BA, -6.79%[8] , which was the biggest contributor to the S...00's earnings decline in the second quarter[9], will have to answer questions about reports on Friday saying it misled regulators about 737 Max safety long before two deadly crashes. While Boeing is expected to be back in the black this time around, it hasn't escaped the Max controversy: The aircraft manufacturer is expected to report a 40% drop in profit and a 22% decline in sales. Here are other key themes to watch for in the week ahead. Tech titansTwo tech stalwarts of the Dow are set to report next week: Microsoft Corp.  MSFT, -1.63%[10] on Wednesday and Intel Corp.  INTC, -0.96%[11] on Thursday.  Microsoft is expected to ride the wave of its Azure cloud-computing business to another big quarter of growth. Analysts model 11% overall growth for the company, led by a 22% increase in the intelligent cloud segment. Intel's report will show how customers are dealing with the potential for tariffs to affect PCs in December and whether they've been moving up orders to get ahead of that deadline. Such a move could impact Intel in a number of ways, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who's interested to learn if supply constraints have returned and whether the company will issue a conservative forecast for the holiday quarter. Rounding out the DowCaterpillar Inc.'s  CAT, -0.25%[12] Wednesday morning report will give a glimpse into what William Blair analyst Lawrence De Maria calls a 'plummeting' market for construction equipment in North America. 'It is one of the first capital-goods companies to report, and as a bellwether, the company typically sets the tone for the season, which is unlikely to be positive,' he wrote.  Caterpillar earnings: Expect weakness on China tensions and global economic slowdown[13]  A more aggressive promotional landscape likely helped Verizon Communications Inc.  VZ, 1.06%[14] report a big quarter of new subscribers, according to Guggenheim's Mike McCormack, who models 387,000 phone additions. The company posts results on Friday morning.  Other Dow components on the docket for the week are Travelers Cos. Inc.  TRV, 0.63%[15], United Technologies Corp.  UTX, -0.99%[16], Procter ...mble Co.  PG, 0.72%[17], and McDonald's Corp.  MCD, 0.80%[18], which all report on Tuesday. Dow Inc.DOW, 0.31%[19], Visa Inc.  V, -1.25%[20], and 3M Co.  MMM, -0.27%[21] are set to deliver results on Thursday.Looking to the holidaysHoliday-season forecasts will be big areas of focus for eBay Inc.EBAY, -0.69%[22] and Amazon.com Inc.  AMZN, -1.68%[23], the two e-commerce giants on this week's slate. For Amazon, a crucial question is how the company's push for free one-day shipping will affect operating profits heading into the crucial quarter. EBay will be looking to show that everything is under control after the company's chief executive stepped down a month ago[24] amid a disagreement with the company's board.  For more: EBay CEO leaves amid activist fight to spin off wait, haven't we already done this?[25]  EBay is in the process of reviewing its business units amid pressure from activists who want the company to spin off non-core segments like Classifieds and StubHub.  'We expect to hear more details on the outcome of the operating review at earnings, as eBay noted in March it intends to announce the findings and targets from the review at an event in the fall,' Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in an earnings preview.  EBay is on the docket for Wednesday afternoon, while Amazon follows a day later. United Parcel Services Inc.'s  UPS, -0.88%[26] Tuesday morning report could also provide a window into what to expect for holiday shipments.Social standingSnap Inc.  SNAP, -1.89%[27] will look to keep its streak of user growth alive on Tuesday afternoon, this time relying on upgrades to its Android app, rather than the popular 'age filters' that drove a bulk of Snap's user additions three months back[28]. Analysts expect the company to sport its third-straight quarter of daily-active-user growth\u2014even if it likely won't be at the level of the 13 million new users Snap picked up last time around.  Snap earnings: Riding the Android redesign to grow its user base[29]  User growth is expected to come down for Twitter  TWTR, -1.57%[30] as well, while still remaining in positive territory. The consensus forecast models about 3 million new monetizable daily active users for the quarter, compared with 5 million three months back. The key questions for Twitter on Thursday morning are whether the company's desktop-site changes are helping users better find content that interests them and whether new ad products are still showing traction with advertisers.

The warnings seemed to come out of nowhere and delivered an unwelcome reality check for a region that was just feeling better after a prolonged downturn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic experts are split about whether this is the end of the road for the tech recovery or just a bump. But the absence of any clear explanation for what went wrong is only making people more jittery.</p><p>\"I think the collective psyche is very fragile,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. \"And no one wants to get caught being too optimistic again.\"</p><p>The warnings spooked investors, who drove the Nasdaq down 6 percent over the past two weeks to close Friday at 1,883.15. The SV150 index was down 9.7 percent over the same period, slicing the value of those companies by $93.6 billion to $873 billion.</p><p>The parade of warnings began in early July, just after the June quarter ended. Most of the announcements were clustered in the software industry: PeopleSoft, Veritas, Siebel Systems, Computer Associates, Sybase, Compuware, BMC Software, Informatica and Ascential Software.</p><p>They grew to include hardware companies such as contract manufacturer JabilCircuit and cell phone leader Nokia. And then came a Merrill Lynch report last week that said the chip sector had peaked.</p><p>Analysts turned sour, started downgrading their stocks, and began grilling tech executives on conference calls. Even when companies turned in good quarters, like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, the growing gloom led observers to focus on negatives.</p><p>'What has changed?'</p><p>During Intel's conference call Tuesday, Adam Parker, a Sanford Bernstein analyst, pounded executives with repeated questions about why their inventories had grown so much over the past month.</p><p>\"It came as a surprise?\" Parker asked in exasperation, still not clear on what had happened.</p><p>Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said Intel was doing fine and inventory grew because of a new manufacturing process.</p><p>But even Bryant remained cautious.</p><p>\"We look forward to a good second half, although as the economic recovery proceeds, the year-to-year growth rates of the last year will inevitably subside somewhat,\" he said.</p><p>During a conference call with Advanced Micro Devices the next day, Joe Osha of Merrill Lynch tried to decipher executives' comments.</p><p>\"What has changed?\" Osha asked. \"I have never seen you guys this skittish on the outlook. It seems something has changed.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to debate you on the phone,\" said Rob Rivet, Advanced Micro Device's chief financial officer. \"We used words last quarter like 'modestly.' Now see 'moderate growth.' The code is that it's a good quarter.\"</p><p>But the truth remains elusive.</p><p>One theory blames the general state of the economy: Oil prices are still high, the war in Iraq is distracting, interest rates are set to rise, the most recent jobs report was weaker than expected, and a tax credit for large purchases is set to expire. Denis Pombriant, managing principal of Beagle Research Group in Stoughton, Mass., said the economy was never as strong as people thought.</p><p>\"I hate to say this, but I think the emperor is walking around in his underwear,\" Pombriant said. \"I think the economy is unsettled. And I don't think we'll get any clarity until after the election.\"</p><p>A second line of thinking blames factors related to the market for technology. These include some large customers remaining cautious and even delaying some spending, big tech companies squeezing out smaller competitors, and the new Sarbanes-Oxley regulations -- the sweeping slate of corporate reforms passed in 2002 -- proving to be costly and time-consuming for information technology departments to implement.</p><p>\"There are still people out there who think there is something special about tech that makes it a growth industry forever,\" said Pip Coburn, a global technology strategist for UBS. \"And that's both haunting and disturbing.\"</p><p>'Back to Earth'</p><p>Finally, it's possible that expectations just got a little out of whack. With sales picking up, it's possible some executives and analysts got too excited and optimistic.</p><p>\"It's a bump in the road,\" Zandi said. \"The fundamentals are still very strong. Expectations were very high. There may be a bit of coming back to Earth. But I think the pessimism among Wall Street analysts is unwarranted.\"</p><p>One area of agreement is that spending on information technology has not slowed. Martin Reynolds, a Gartner analyst who surveys companies on their tech spending, said he has seen no major change in behavior in the past few months.</p><p>\"We see that tech spending is going to continue to be strong,\" Reynolds said.</p><p>But the bad news is many analysts also agree that the renewed uncertainty is likely to continue making companies cautious when it comes to hiring and expanding their workforces as they wait for a clearer outlook.</p><p>For most, memories of the downturn remain too strong.</p><p>\"The last two years, we've been tiptoeing thought a minefield,\" Pombriantsaid. \"Things have been turning around.

Eliminating Abusive or Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) was proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and sponsored by senators from both sides of the aisle such as Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). The bill is also supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children[1] and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation[2]. However, this bill is problematic for both freedom of speech and privacy online according to Riana Pfefferkorn[3], associate director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Center for Internet and Society. 'This bill is trying to convert your anger at Big Tech into law enforcement's long-desired dream of banning strong encryption,' argued Pfefferkorn in a blog post[4]. Pfefferkorn's detailed explanation says EARN IT appears less like a legitimate way to prevent the spread of child exploitation content and more like a covert attempt to ban end-to-end encryption, without having to ban it outright. At the end of January 2020, a draft of the proposal was leaked and met with similar apprehension not only by Big tech juggernauts (Facebook, Google, etc.) </p><p>but also their sometimes opposing counterparts, freedom of speech advocates. 'We're concerned the EARN IT Act may be used to roll back encryption, which protects everyone's safety from hackers and criminals, and may limit the ability of American companies to provide the private and secure services that people expect,' Facebook spokesperson Thomas Richards said in a statement[5] to the Washington Post. Clearly, the issue could not be more sensitive. Patrick A. Trueman, president and CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, recently voiced[6] this opinion, apparently advocating for EARN IT. 'Right now, Big Tech has no incentive to prevent predators from grooming, recruiting, and trafficking children online and as a result countless children have fallen victim to child abusers on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok,' said Trueman.Section 230: The Most Important Law Protecting Freedom of Speech OnlineWhile everyone who has publicly condemned EARN IT has also stated a universal commitment to child safety online and in the real world, many say the bill's far-reaching approach to content moderation could do more harm than good by essentially eliminating private conversations across the internet, particularly on social media platforms and messaging apps. To fully comprehend what EARN IT proposes, one needs to understand the importance of two bills passed in the '90s. These laid the groundwork for how privacy and free speech are supposed to operate for U.S. citizens. First, Section 230[7] of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), passed in 1996, allows for the continued development of the internet as a free market and universal good for free speech. Section 230 says that online platforms or providers of interactive computer services mostly cannot be held responsible for the things their users say or do on their platforms. It uses the term 'mostly' instead of 'always' because platforms are still liable for exceptions that violate intellectual and federal criminal law. Essentially, this means if someone is defamed for being a fraud, that person can sue their defamer, but they cannot sue the platform for providing the space for free speech. Second, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA[8]), passed in 1994, requires telecom providers to make their networks 'wiretappable' for law enforcement. However, it also ensured a 'carve-out' for encrypted messages and information services where websites, email, social media, messaging apps and cloud storage fall out of CALEA's jurisdiction. The purpose of these carve-outs was to reach a compromise between the competing interests of network security providers, privacy advocates, civil liberties, technological growth and law enforcement. In combination, Section 230 and CALEA prevent regulation from suffocating growth and development of the U.S. information economy.Weakening ProtectionsSince the '90s, more regulation has passed to undo Section 230. 'Section 230 has been amended since it was passed: SESTA/FOSTA[9], enacted in 2018, pierces providers' immunity from civil and state-law claims about sex trafficking,' wrote Pfefferkorn. SESTA/FOSTA is currently being challenged[10] in federal court being unconstitutional and doing more harm than good. There is also already a regulatory reporting scheme[11] for online providers combatting CSAM. Also, Section 230 does not keep federal prosecutors from holding providers accountable for CSAM on their services. While the current reporting scheme's success is questionable, there is reasonable evidence to believe that EARN IT is an attempt to regulate communication on the internet more broadly. 'The so-called EARN IT bill will strip Section 230 protections away from any website that doesn't follow a list of 'best practices,' meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy,' writes[12] Joe Mullin, a policy analyst with the Electronic Freedom Foundation. Mullin is referring to how EARN IT would target CSAM. It proposes to do this by creating a federal commission to develop a list of best practices for preventing CSAM that online platform providers would have to follow or else lose their immunity under Section 230 \u2014 meaning they could be sued into bankruptcy. This commission would largely be made up of law enforcement and allied groups such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). According to Mullin, 'The 'best practices' list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption and guarantee law enforcement 'legal access' to any digital message.' Although the word 'encryption' does not appear anywhere in the EARN IT bill, Mullin is suspicious of how the federal commission might design best practices. For instance, in an earlier draft of the bill, the NCMEC Vice-President stated that online services should be made to screen all messages using screening technology approved by themselves and law enforcement, report what they find in messages to the NCMEC and be held legally responsible for the content of the messages sent by others.See Also<url normalizedValue=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/freedom-of-speech-in-financial-commerce-1369969664\">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/freedom-of-speech-in-financial-commerce-1369969664</url> In short, the commission could quietly give backdoor access to all U.S. hosted information services, undoing encrypted messages altogether.Centralized Control and 'Techlash'Mullin, Pfefferkorn and other outspoken critics of EARN IT all agree that the bill's proposed execution is opening the door for the elimination of encryption: the fact that it is never explicitly addressed is especially concerning.. According to Mullin, it's also possible that the current draft of EARN IT will be amended to undo the damage it could do to online privacy. 'Could be as straightforward as putting a clause in[,] saying the bill doesn't apply to encryption,' he writes. However, until some amendment occurs, critics are wary of a federal commission consisting of fewer than twenty people, according to the latest reports, who would be making large-scale privacy and security decisions for the entire U.S. population. Such a potentially big power grab would seem a bit ridiculous, but Pfefferkorn also acknowledged that EARN IT rides on a wave of resentment or 'techlash' the U.S. population has begun to harbor against many internet-based companies. This animosity is directed toward both U.S. tech juggernauts, whose business models run off of surveillance capitalism and online free speech platforms which, for the average person, can feel like the 'concentrated font of human venality every time we open our phones,' according to Pfefferkorn.Private Messaging: A Prerequisite to DemocracyIn general, free speech on social media platforms is already a nuanced and complicated topic. Even under Section 230, social media platforms can still censor content when they deem it inappropriate internally. For example, Twitter has a keyword blacklist[13] and the protocol for how it works can change on a dime. For Nozomi Hayase[14], social psychologist and writer, surveillance of encrypted messaging is a movement toward forfeiting democracy. By Hayase's reasoning, privacy is a prerequisite for a kind of solitude that allows people to think and act independently and is, therefore, essential to a functioning democratic society. 'Democracy requires sovereign individuals who are able to communicate with one another freely. This freedom comes with great responsibility,' said Hayase, who recognized EARN IT as the newest installment of a dangerous trend toward online censorship. 'If we really want to have a truly democratic society, we have to accept the fact that it is the duty of each person to develop his or her own moral capacity to determine what is right and wrong, instead of depending on an external authority to tell us what we should or should not do.' Currently, EARN IT has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Citizens can contact their congressmen directly or take action[15] through the Electronic Frontier Foundation's website.

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Monday to you. And it is Monday, March 26.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Averting a trade war -- \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning is reporting that the White House and China have held behind the scenes negotiations in an effort to ease rising tensions following the administration's move to impose strict tariffs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result markets are rallying. Dow industrials expected to be up almost 300 points right at the start of trading this morning. That's better than 1 percent. Nasdaq up 1.5 percent right now, 97 points higher. And the S&amp;P is up 31; that's 1.25 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news comes after a rough week at the office last week. Dow Industrials down yet again Friday capping a week which saw all three major indices fall roughly 6 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, slight gains across the board -- take a look. The FT 100 is up half a percent. The CAC 40 up a third of a percent. And the DAX index up two thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly higher with the exception of China. Best performers there Kospi index in Korea up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Well, apology status -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking out a full-page ad in newspapers across the globe promising to do better following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Is it enough? The very latest and the new questions over the company's access to your data.</p><p>And then gaining ground, new Fox News poll show Republicans are tightening the gap with Democrats. What you need to know ahead of the important 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>After more than 200 years in business, America's oldest gun maker has filed for bankruptcy -- the details behind Remington's decision.</p><p>Plus a good move ore tunnel vision -- Elon Musk debuting the boring company's latest swag -- life-sized Legos. Why he plans to build on the company's flame thrower success.</p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about it -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC partner Mitch Roschelle; and pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter.</p><p>Great to see everybody.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning -- every Monday.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS: We've got a lot of news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we do. We see a market that's completely turning around this morning.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And the market did a complete reversal from where it was Thursday and Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: No, it's so interesting. Last week initially we were talking about the China tariffs. We're saying I wonder if this is a negotiating strategy, if he's going to throw this out and then China connects on the cable and that's what we are seeing maybe it's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And trying to maybe into the table the whole time but backdoor negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you -- after looking at this subject I have learned so much about what China is doing. It's not just about transferring technology to China and acquiring some of the best and most important sectors that we are or trying to acquire, the most important sectors like robotics and AI that China is doing.</p><p>They are also trying hard to be number one in terms of military. They're acquiring infrastructure all across the world, owning that infrastructure and then getting a spot on the sea level -- on the sea lane in different parts of the world and setting up military bases there.</p><p>Very interesting. That's what Devin Nunes from the intel committee told me yesterday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: But that's one of the reasons that the spending bill in the runaway spending and the debt dovetails with what we're trying to do with China because we lose some valuable ammunition the more that we run up our national debt and the more that we basically are running $1 trillion budget deficits every year because then we have to lien on China even more to continue to buy that debt. And surely not sell what they already own being the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why every time we hear a rumor that China's starting to sell treasuries or buying lesser than what people expect -- you see massive selloff in the stock market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And quite -- my opinion, but if you wanted to really have your allies lock arms with you to take on in China, it's not just the United States intellectual property and abuse and its motives. We need to lock arms with our allies so then you don't throw on those steel and aluminum tariffs and basically kind of shock those very allies ahead of wanting to take a harder stance with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The 10 industries that they want to, by 2025 be the world leader in --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: -- aerospace, next gen technology, robotics, agriculture, rail advancements --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- shipping and bio-tech.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. These are things that we also want to be leaders in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that list and I will focus on that list. We're going to talk about that list coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining the conversation Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred making an appearance today, he will be in studio with us; former U.S. Ambassador to China and former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke is with us as well. A lot to talk about with him.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off right now with this. Markets -- futures are indicating a big rally at the start of trading this morning. Markets are on a tear as \"The Journal\" is reporting that Washington and Beijing has begun negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese markets.</p><p>This comes as House intel committee chairman Devin Nunes told me yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", \"congressional investigators have been looking into Chinese practices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: They are stealing our intellectual property. So either it's through the internet or it's through investing in educational systems here or think tanks. They are bringing people here. I believe that they are still in Silicon Valley blind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee and North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker. Chairman Walker -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. MARK WALKER (R-NC), REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE: Thanks-- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Devin Nunes just said that his committee is investigating this. What should be investigated?</p><p>WALKER: Well, if you look, my first two years in Congress, it was an eye- opener for me serving on the homeland security, realizing how many times per day, tens of thousands of times per day that China literally hacks every industry that we have. They are the biggest stealers of our intellectual property and have been doing it for decades.</p><p>So the Trump body language and the movement to throw down some for warning shots I think is very important and sends a very clear message.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you like what the President has done here then?</p><p>WALKER: I do. Obviously we want to make sure that the tariffs ultimately do not get to the place where there is an increase in consumer costs or ultimately even jobs. But I believe going after bad actors and communicating very clearly what the Chinese have been doing, specifically their leadership, I think is a very educational moment for Americans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell -- though if China retaliates, they've already started talking about tariffs on pork but then what about hogs. That would hammer the very people in your state. And if they do retaliate, they will go after those states in those places who voted for President Trump.</p><p>WALKER: Absolutely. There's no question. And this will just impact theirs, even has ties to the E.U. the F Corp located here in Greensboro, very concerned, even things about Wrangler jeans -- a 25 percent hike across Europe.</p><p>This -- ultimately we know that free trade is very important. We have to be careful here but sending a shot across the bow, I am glad to see that these -- what we thought was very wide scope tariffs have been narrowing. And we want to make sure that it doesn't unroll or disembark the good work from regulatory relief and tax reform that we've seen already.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I mean do you think that $3 billion in tariffs that China has promised last week -- was that just a gesture? I mean obviously it's not commensurate with $60 billion in tariffs that the U.S. is talking about. It's $3 billion.</p><p>So is China just saying we are not rolling over, but we're also not going to do anything to mess with this $375 billion surplus that we have?</p><p>WALKER: I think at this point, Maria, that is correct. Maybe more a gesture than anything else but ultimately, as most of your panelists would know, we certainly don't want to let it devolve into a trade war.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WALKER: So one of the reasons that the spending bill is so important that we make sure -- I think Dagen hit it out of the park just a few minutes ago, breaking that down. It's very important that we keep our fiscal house in order as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, ok. You said that. That's what we were talking about all morning but fiscal has an order $1.3 trillion spending bill, I don't know. It doesn't add up, sir.</p><p>You know, we've got brand new Fox News polls show this morning that Republicans are narrowing the gap with Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats had have a five-point lead over the GOP but this comes as Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Ryan Costello confirmed yesterday that he will drop his bid for reelection and retire at the end of his term.</p><p>So Chairman Walker -- are you worried that the Republicans are going to lose the majority in the House and how does the spending bill play into that?</p><p>WALKER: Well, I think that is secondary. I think ultimately what we need to be doing as members of Congress is fulfilling our promises and let the chips fall where they may. Do I believe that we have much to run off in 2017? We do -- ANWR, regulatory relief, tax reform, pro-life legislation. But if Republicans get to the mindset that we can spend like the Democrats do and not doing anything from here to November, I think that would be cataclysmic.</p><p>I think it's very important to continue to build on those promises. The Republican Study Committee is coming back with the great fervor pushing for a balanced budget amendment. We'll also develop our own Republican Study Committee budget that's going to be much more in tune in balancing intense come elected and very important we communicate. Hopefully in 10 and 11 -- at the most 12 years, it's very important that we communicate these principles to the American public --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WALKER: -- if Republicans want to keep the majority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we want to talk about this because we all have problems with the spending bill -- sir. I mean the economy will obviously be a big issue in the midterms and the President is tweeting about this, this morning.</p><p>Here's what the President said just a few minutes ago. \"The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kinds of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"</p><p>Do you agree with that? And do you believe that if we keep running up all of this deficit, that that is going to cut into the growth?</p><p>WALKER: I believe temporarily we are seeing some wonderful economic recovery news. However, if you look out just a few years, our mandatory spending had gone from about a third of our budget to closing in to 75 percent, 76 percent of our budget. We simply can't sustain that.</p><p>In this specific omnibus, it increased nondiscretionary spending -- or discretionary spending 13 percent in one year. As a fiscal conservative, some people like to say a fiscal hawk. Sometimes we feel like we're the adults in the room trying to say or trying to put out some warning signs. We are the only group that doesn't have a special interest that we are advocating for.</p><p>Where Defense needs massive, they were out, stood in the empty silos in Alaska where this previous administration depleted our military defense. But at the same time we have to understand that unless we're willing to go after this mandatory reforms, we will not leave the next generation very much to work with.</p><p>CARTER: So Congressman -- you guys have the House, you have the Senate, you have the White House. And if you can't get this through now, when are you going to get it through and how is it going to be different eight months from now than it is right now.</p><p>Because it seems to me, that if you couldn't have gotten it done this time, how are you going to get it done?</p><p>WALKER: That's a very fair question. I remember sitting in the room with the Majority Leader when Congressman Tom Graves came up with the idea almost a year ago that we would get all 12 appropriations bills done through the house for the first time in 13 years.</p><p>We have met that goal, sent it to the Senate. The senate never took up a single appropriation. We then tried again in package 4 props bills, budgetary bills and put into one particular piece of legislation. They still didn't take it up.</p><p>So there has been some talk. Does the Senate eventually move to a 51 simple majority when it comes to any kind of budgeting idea or appropriations? I don't know the solution, but we're going to keep the pressure, keep the press on, really exposing those who are putting a stop in the progress.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And clearly there's some politicking going on with the pushback on President Trump signing the spending bill on Friday because Secretary Mnuchin of the Treasury Department was on with Chris Wallace yesterday. And Chris Wallace had to remind him when he brought up the idea of a line- item veto, he wanted Congress to pass the rule for a line-item veto so the President could go through and veto line items in the spending bill.</p><p>And Chris Wallace had to remind him well, that was ruled some years ago unconstitutional.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There will be a constitutional amendment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So again, you know, you can pass a constitutional amendment but that requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.</p><p>WALKER: It does -- Dagen. But let's not just talk about the policy. Let's talk about the process of getting a nearly 2,300 page bill on the evening of the next day you're supposed to be voting for it.</p><p>We have eight full-time people, staffers on the Republican Study Committee. Two stayed up all night, trying to get through the bill. They weren't able to complete. I think it is preposterous to ask us to vote on something so lengthy with the amount of pork and level that was in the specific piece of legislation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But YOU did it.</p><p>WALKER: No, I didn't. I was one of 90 that voted against it. And we're going to continue to rule against it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, this is an important point that you bring up. You voted against it so you weren't one of those people who said all right, look, I'm just going to throw in the towel here just to get the spending for the military.</p><p>What are you supposed to do the next time? The President said he's never spending something like this -- he's never signing something like this again.</p><p>WALKER: Well, this bill should've never reached the President's desk. It did not even have some of the specifics that he had asked for, for wall funding. I think we acquiesced a little bit too much. I've got to give the speaker a little bit of props here because I understood some of the talks and some of the battles that he was facing trying to get at least some of the things across the finish line.</p><p>But this bill is really not good. You're talking about an increase of 13 percent in one year in discretionary funding. That is ridiculous.</p><p>I believe it's very important that not just 90 of us but more and more members of Congress have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to being fiscally conscious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WALKER: This is preposterous that we would increase this kind of debt. We are now matching levels -- think about this - -we are now matching levels if not even more of a deficit than Obama's last three, maybe four years in office.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>WALKER: We promise to do better and I hope that -- I hope more members will wake up to that cause.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- thank you. Thanks so much. Mark Walker joining us there.</p><p>WALKER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Dozens of people including children killed in a fire in a Russian mall.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Maria.</p><p>Reports say at least 64 people been killed, another 16 are still missing -- dozens of children are among the victims. The blaze started on the upper floor of the Winter Cherry Complex in Siberia while many of the victims were at the movies. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p><p>The shopping mall which opened in 2013 has a cinema, a petting zoo, a children's center and a bowling alley.</p><p>Well, America's oldest gun maker is filing for bankruptcy protection. Remington -- taking that step due to a heavy debt load, falling sales and lawsuits following the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.</p><p>Under the bankruptcy plan, control of Remington would shift to its creditors which include Franklin Resources and JPMorgan Chase. Much of the company's debt will be erased and its filing also means that Surplus Capital Management will no longer own Remington.</p><p>Elon Musk unveiling his plan to sell rocks that are carved out by his tunneling venture. Here is his tweet and how he announced it. \"New boring company merch\" -- which is merchandise\" -- \"coming soon. Life-size Lego- like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures and buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored -- like an aircraft wing span so not heavy.\"</p><p>The boring company's main (INAUDIBLE) project is a network of tunnels under the city of Los Angeles. Of course, Maria, this is Elon Musk's big, you know, dream to make these hyper loops so that we can get from city to city a lot quicker. That's the idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good stuff.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up -- Facebook is saying sorry again. The reaction to the social media company's new apology in print, following its breach of trust, next.</p><p>And then Uber selling its Southeast Asia business to a rival company -- we break down that deal coming up. Back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Facebook's mea culpa -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing for the company's breach of trust in a full-page ad in six U.K. and three U.S. newspapers following the scandal. Facebook shares are looking like this, this morning after a tough week last week where the company gave up more then 10 percent of its value. That stock is up fractionally right now.</p><p>Joining us right now is Gabelli multimedia trust portfolio manager Larry Haverty who owns Facebook and many other companies.</p><p>Do you think it's done enough -- Larry? Good to see you.</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Yes, I think basically, Maria, the crisis could have been addressed earlier by Zuckerberg. My big rant on the company, if you will, is that Zuckerberg is the captain of the ship and he should have been at that all-hands meeting that they had on Tuesday rather than sending a lawyer.</p><p>But after Wednesday, I think somebody got into his ear or there are a lot of smart people at Facebook and since then in my opinion they've done all the right things. They've hit all the boxes including the advertisement, which I think should've been earlier but in my opinion was very effective.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Larry -- looking more broadly at the tech sector and the fact that the big run-up in the market, a lot of it was the big tech names in terms of the S&amp;P. How -- does this really impact the broader technology sector, investors are going to start shying away a bit?</p><p>HAVERTY: I don't really think so. I look at the tech sector versus other consumer equities. And you look at the tech company like Google or Facebook on current cash flow around 17 times and you look at a consumer product company that has maybe a 1 percent growth rate and it's 12 times.</p><p>So tech is really very, very underpriced. The only reason that tech would I think have big problems is if you had a very significant increase in interest rates and/or an acceleration in inflation and that would have to be energy driven and I don't see any chance of that. It's going to happen any time soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about an increase in regulation? What if we have a whole new rule book now for Facebook and all of these other companies that have an incredible amount of data? Does that cut into earnings and change the reason to own these stocks?</p><p>Haverty: I think for sure it does and for sure we're going to see something like that particularly in Europe and the U.K. where the new regulations are really pretty stringent on what they can do. And the U.K. people are very, very conservative about this, at least as far as my understanding is.</p><p>And you know, what you're looking at is a slowing in the rate of birth. Say, if you thought Google was going to grow at 20 percent. Maybe it's growing at 18. If you thought Facebook was growing at 30 percent. May be it's 25. I don't really think it's any lower than that Maria, because you have so much growth in, you know, -- I was just in Australia and New Zealand last week and they are growing like weed over there.</p><p>I think with this it's unlikely that they are going to get into China. That would be the big bonanza. But there's a lot of growth in the world and the thing about these companies is at the end of the day they don't give you anything. They are not giving you Colgate toothpaste; they're not giving you soap. Their cost to good sold is virtually nothing. So if they get any revenue, they can't spend the money really fast enough so it goes to free clash flow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with Facebook, we talked about regulation and the addict calls. And even if they choose, even if it's not through regulation, is they choose to dial their business back -- that potentially reduces revenue and profit.</p><p>However, you do have a rising tide to people basically getting rid of their Facebook account. And it might -- maybe it's temporary. Maybe it's not but which companies also benefit from this backlash like an Apple -- again, you can use Apple messenger, you can use your iCloud e-mail because they certainly are more principled and their primary source of revenue and income is not selling people's data unbeknownst to them.</p><p>HAVERTY: Well, I think one of the beneficiaries is maybe what we now call old media. And you look at one of the companies in the news, Unilever. And Unilever is apparently very irritated at Facebook. And of course, Unilever is a British and a Dutch company and that goes in line with what I was saying about the regulation over there.</p><p>Well, Unilever is not going to stop advertising so some of some of it is probably going to filter down to the old guys. But importantly, my training as in economics; and in economics, you learn to talk and think about the margin.</p><p>And what you're talking about is the margin, it's not the mass. Could they lose three, four, five percent of their subscribers? Absolutely. Do I expect that they're going to lose that? Absolutely I do.</p><p>Is it discounted in the market? I think a lot of it is discounted because Facebook already lost -- pick a number -- $60 billion, $70 billion in market value. That's not a casual number.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They could maintain their profit margin by laying people off.</p><p>HAVERTY: You are talking about a 40 percent profit margin. This isn't a supermarket company with a 6 percent margin.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. What's their annual income, net income -- $50 billion?</p><p>HAVERTY: I look at in on operating cash flows so it's $23 billion. Google's around $32 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. It's their income number, not revenue -- that's incredible.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The numbers are really staggering -- yes, sir.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think we'll look at those numbers and realize that they're your personal information that they were basically not protecting and handing off to other companies. That's how they make that much.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And monetizing it -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>CARTER: I'm curious though because it used to be that Facebook was like the thing in town. And now there's so many alternatives. You've got Snapshot, you've got Instagram. There's all these other things that are rising in popularity. So if Facebook doesn't do the right thing, don't you think they could go the way of Kodak and Blackberry? And these other --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY: Oh, no, no, no.</p><p>CARTER: We don't. Tell me why. Tell me why.</p><p>HAVERTY: Because basically these applications have really changed your life.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY: No one in our business can get along without Google. I mean I can't tell you how many times --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's a prize to be paid -- Larry.</p><p>HAVERTY: of course there is, and that's -- you know, that's for the market -- that's for the market to decide. And the market sets its price, I think, based upon interest rates and alternatives. And if interest rates stay anywhere near where they are and I think that is the best bet, the price is not unreasonable.</p><p>You're paying -- For Google, 17 times cash flow. That's a six percent return. Google is growing 20 percent. You get 3 percent if you invest with the government for 30 years; 6 percent from Google versus 3 percent from the government, I'm going to go with Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's Facebook trading out right now?</p><p>HAVERTY: Facebook right now is about 18 times -- running rate casual.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Amazon?</p><p>HAVERTY: Amazon -- that's another story. On operating cash flow it's around 34.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>HAVERTY: But the reality is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But next year's earning is the a hundred. There's really virtually no earnings and with what he's planning to do. I can see that there's going to be any earnings any time soon.</p><p>I have a lot of trouble with Amazon -- Maria. I think it's going to sooner or later run into the antitrust people. I don't know when or why or how, but I've been reading about Rockefeller. Amazon to me looks an awful lot like standard oil and Standard Doyle who got broken up into many, many pieces. So you think they're going to break it up.</p><p>HAVERTY: I think they will break up Amazon web services and that other Amazon businesses; and the other Amazon businesses then will not have any cash flow to support them (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ways to watch Amazon try to buy Microsoft and then all of a sudden Washington wakes up. He said wait a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. No, I think they are on tour right now. I think they're on tour right now, you know, even without a big acquisition like that. But we will see. That's a big statement you just made. You think Amazon Web services gets broken up.</p><p>HAVERTY: I think that it's the fuel for anti-social behavior. The parallels to standard oil are pretty strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. We're going to look at that. Larry -- thank you.</p><p>HAVERTY: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Larry Haverty joining us from Gabelli.</p><p>Coming up -- the House Judiciary committee has subpoenaed the Justice Department for records tied to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. Now the House intelligence committee is looking to raise the stakes. What Chairman Nunes has to say on the issue -- next.</p><p>And then Disney World says kids will eat for free. How the company will help you save at the happiest place on earth.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is Monday, March 26th, the stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the east coast. Easing fears of a trade war this morning, we've got a big really underway right now. Futures indicating big gains at the start of trading after a new report from the Wall Street journal this morning, reviles that the US and China have been holding behind the scenes negotiations to solve trade concerns.</p><p>The talks follow a brutal week for stocks last. All three major industries down about six percent on the week as you can see right there, looking at the global markets this morning, taking a queue from the US's rally. Most of the major industries in Europe are higher across the board. The F2 100 up a half of a percent,(CAX) and Paris up a third of a percent, DAX index in German up two thirds of a percent.</p><p>And overnight in Asia most agencies we're higher with the exception of Shanghai Composite in China, Nikkei average in Japan up three quarters of one percent. Digging into the DOJ, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed the Department Of Justice for all the documents regarding the Clinton e-mail scandal and more, the very latest twist in this search for answers coming up.</p><p>And Uber puts South East Asia in the rearview mirror. Why the ride sharing giant is selling its entire business for that region. Plus the happiest meal on earth, how your kids can eat for free at Disney World this summer. And then pack - back in the swing of things. Get excited baseball fans opening day is this Thursday. I'm talking to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred about the big changes coming this season both on and off the field. Yes it is baseball season once again.</p><p>But first our top story this half hour investigating the investigators, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte sent a subpoena to the Department Of Justice last week as you know. Demanding all the documents related to the Clinton e-mail scandal. The Subpoena also seeks access to any files on alleged abuses to the foreign intelligence surveillance act, the FISA Court. I spoke about that with House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes yesterday on Sunday morning Futures.</p><p>DEVIN NUNES, HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN: As we're still looking into FISA abuse and other matters, we still have a lot of witnesses to bring in from the State Department and from the FBI and DOJ. To try to get to the bottom of, was there a conspiracy to go after the Trump Campaign? Did people purposely obstruct Congresses investigation? We still need to get those answers that what we continue to look at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He said if all of the documents requested are not on his desk and Bob Goodlatte's by the time they get back from their Easter break which is in two weeks. He is going to call them in contempt of Congress. Joining us right now is FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, Judge good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANAYLST: Good Morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the fall out of contempt of Congress? What is the fall out if the Department Of Justice doesn't turn over these documents? Because we know they've been stonewalled for six months already.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well former Attorney General Eric Holder was personally held in contempt of Congress and nothing happened. They didn't prosecute it. They didn't sue him. It didn't affect his license to practice law. Absolutely nothing happened. So it depends upon how serious they want to be. They obviously were not serious with Eric Holder.</p><p>Now a couple of basics, you can't hold the FBI in contempt. You can hold the Custodian of Documents, who's refusing to surrender them in contempt. You can hold the Director of the FBI, who's stonewalling the surrender, same thing with the DOJ. So we have a Republican Congress now trying to examine what a Democratic DOJ, Department Of Justice did in the investigation of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Was there a conspiracy to exonerate her no matter what the evidence said? And those documents and that information is now in the hands of a Republican DOJ, which is resisting cooperating with a Republican congress. Why would Republicans in the Department Of Justice resist cooperating with Republicans in the House of Representatives about how Democrats in the Department Of Justice, follow me here, exonerated Mrs. Clinton?</p><p>Because there is an institutional attitude, if we don't defend our predecessors, who will defend us when someone is examining why we're making our decisions now?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's not a reason to blow off the law.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Absolutely. My view is if you have that attitude you don't belong in the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Because the government's job especially the Department Of Justice is to find crimes, examine them, and prosecute them. Not look the other way. So I don't know where this is going to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why so many people are calling for a second Special Counsel, just as Lindsey Graham did yesterday, watch this.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, US SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLIA: Well I want more information. I want to be able to prove that the FBI investigation of the Clinton e-mail scandal was a sham. That the lead investigator, the lead FBI agent hated Trump, supportive of Clinton, they whitewashed the e-mail scandal. If you had done what she had done you'd probably be in jail now, and to hold the FBI accountable for not doing their job correctly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I could not agree more. I don't agree on calling for a special counsel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But I agree on everything he just said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't like special counsels.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: No I don't like special counsels for a couple of reasons. One they tend to go off course in order to justify their existence. They've invited our prosecuting manifest for events that occurred - financial events as we all know that occurred long before Donald Trump was running.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And which have nothing to do with any collusion?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct, correct. But second, think about this. Bob Mueller is the Special Council. Who works for him? 13 lawyers from the Justice Department, 2000 --excuse me two dozen, three dozen FBI agents. So it's basically the same people in a revolving door. If you picked the most perfect special council, if you let Lindsey Graham pick the person he wanted to be Special Council. Let Trey Gowdy when he leaves Congress become Special Council.</p><p>His prosecutors will come from the DOJ. His investigators will come from the FBI. It's basically the same thing as if the DOJ investigated. And then you have this institutional reluctance about people that don't want to investigate their predecessors. I think it's a conundrum. But I do believe that we need to get to the truth. The evidence of Mrs. Clinton's guilt. Forget about Republican or Democrat. The evidence of her guilt was overwhelming.</p><p>Did they even present it to a Grand Jury? No. Did Senior and people in the DOJ make an evaluation of it? No. Jim Comey the day after the Fourth of July held a press conference that said I've decided that no rational prosecutor, no reasonable prosecutor would take the case. There for no one's going to take the case.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And a statement that was drafted even before they interview her.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A statement that was authored in part or vetted verbally by Peter Strzok, the conflicted FBI agent that we only know is conflicted.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: One of the reasons --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way no notes. No notes from that FBI interview. No notes from any meetings with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There we're so many absurdities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No notes. Only notes on Donald Trump.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They permitted her former lawyer who was a - herself a target of the investigation to be there and whisper in her ear to help her answer their questions. Something the FBI never permits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, I reported it earlier, I'm expecting more texts to be revealed in the next two weeks something about a White House meeting between those two, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Can we discuss something -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Talking about a White House meeting.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Can we discuss something happy like baseball?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, it's Opening Day on Thursday. Thank you so much because we've got Rob Manfred in the studio coming up. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Judge Andrew Napalitano. It is Opening Day and we are on it this week on Thursday. Coming up next Uber exits from Southeast Asia why the ride handling (ph) company sold its operations to its main competitor. Plus a more affordable way to visit the happiest place on Earth, Disney World's new plans for kids to eat for free. Next.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, while the Saudi leadership is in New York this week, the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia has been the target of a missile strike from Yemen. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEW ANCHOR: Yes, he's in New York today, by the way, Maria. Saudi Arabia says that it has shot down seven ballistic missiles fired by Yemen's Houthis milita. Three missiles were aimed at the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Officials say the debris from the incoming missiles killed one man in what was the first death in Riyadh during the Saudi led three year war in Yemen.</p><p>Well, Uber is getting our of Southeast Asia. They've agreed to sell the business in the region to rival Grab. Uber is going to take a 27 percent stake in Grab. This is the second retreat from Asia for Uber after it sold its China business also to a local rival there. Well, Walt Disney is giving families a way to cut the cost of visiting Disney World for the summer.</p><p>It's offering free meals to kids between the ages of three and nine when parents book a Magic Your Way package. This is between May 28th through August 30th, so the summer. There's a few blackout dates and limitations and families must reserve a package by August 1st. Share of Walt Disney are down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>All I know is it was free and Disney in the same sentence so I had to do the story, Maria. And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you so much. Coming up, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred in the studio here. I had him Opening Day. He'll weigh in on Thursday's big day, big changes coming on and off the field. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. All right it is that time of the year. America's favorite pastime back. Thursday is Opening Day for baseball. For the first time in 50 years every single MLB team will play on Opening Day. All 30 clubs. It is also the earliest Opening Day in league history. Kicking off with the Cubs versus the Marlins on Thursday.</p><p>Other must watch games include defending champs the Astros facing off against the Rangers and the Yankees will take on the Blue Jays in Toronto. Joining me right now and a first on Fox Business Interview MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. Commissioner, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROB MANFRED, MLB COMMISSIONER: Great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. I got to tell you, I've seen a lot and done a lot of stuff over my career. The most exciting day of my life was when I threw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium. I mean, it's incredible. Baseball really is exciting and what do you think about this Opening Day with all 30 clubs opening at once?</p><p>MANFRED: Well, we're thrilled about the idea. We think getting back to the tradition of everybody playing on Opening Day is an exciting thing for the sport. I think it give and opportunity to own Thursday, make opening day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can the Astro's do a repeat?</p><p>MANFRED: Hey, look. The Astro's are really talented, but there are a lot of good teams out there, a lot of buzz around the one team here in New York, the Yankees. Same thing with the Cubs. The Dodgers were great last year, so I think we're going to have a really competitive season.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you've got a competitive season, but also because of all of these new rule changes, right? Let's talk about that. Speeding up the game is one of them. You're testing new pace of play rules in the minor leagues teams. You'll start with a runner on second base if the game goes into extra innings. Does this expand to the major leagues, and tell me about the rule changes and the impact.</p><p>MANFRED: Well the rule changes in the major leagues this year are really speeding up inning breaks. There's a clock. Batters have to be ready to go at 2:05. That should save us about 25 seconds on every inning break, which adds up to be a lot of time. We're limiting mound visits, six per game. The idea there is to take dead time out of the game. We're trying to proceed slowly at the major league level.</p><p>We've been more aggressive in the minor leagues. We have pitch clocks. We've had them for a number of years. We feel like they're successful. Those could come to the major leagues. The extra inning rule, I don't see that at the major league level. Some people really like it. It does make for excitement, but I think breaking the tradition of the extra inning game at the big league level is not likely to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the whole idea of speeding up the game and pacing differently, is that to make sure that it doesn't impact engagement, get the engagement (inaudible) because we've watched what has happened at the NFL. The NFL has been seeing a drop in viewership over the last couple of years. Are you watching this? What are doing in terms of game viewership and is that part of it?</p><p>MANFRED: Oh, it's a huge issue. In the ballpark, pace of game is not a big issue because during the breaks there's a lot going on, there's entertainment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED: . there's things to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's when you're at home watching.</p><p>MANFRED: Home, and every one of those breaks is an opportunity to tune away. We pay a lot of attention to what's going on in other sports. We've been fortunate, however. Our last two World Series have been really successful in terms of our ratings. And during the summer in 25 markets on game days, we're the number one programming on television, so we've been.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Still?</p><p>MANFRED: . very fortunate in that regard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>MANFRED: Yes, it's - look, in the summer time, people remember that baseball is a national pastime and they tune into their local team.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. So a lot of big moves there. The big Yankees move, obviously, the off season. Tell me about that because you've got the Yankees acquiring arguably the two best sluggers, right, Judge and Stanton. How were they able to pull off that trade?</p><p>MANFRED: Well, it was, I think, one of those things where the Marlins felt that, with their new ownership, they wanted to go down a slightly different path. The Yankees were there as willing buyers on what's a very large contract, but it's exciting in New York. The two players together last year hit 111 home runs. I think it's only four short of what Mantle and Maris did in their historic season, so a lot of buzz around that team this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm glad you mentioned the Marlins because you've got the former shortstop, Derek Jeter, now owning the Marlins or part of the Marlins. What does that do for the game? Are former players becoming office executives good for the sport? What's the impact?</p><p>MANFRED: Oh, I think it's great for the sport. I'll tell you, it's difficult at the beginning, you take over a team, you haven't been an owner before, it's obviously difficult to get your footing, but I was down and saw an Marlins spring training game recently, talked to a bunch of people in the organization. Derek's done a phenomenal job. The organization is very positive. They've got a lot of great, young talent that they brought back in these trades, and I have every, every expectation that Derek's going to be really successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I would imagine when somebody who knows the games, knows the tricks, just knows how to get around the field as an owner, it could be real positive.</p><p>MANFRED: Look, I think it's a huge positive to have former players, particularly a player of Derek's stature, involved on the ownership side of the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the new tax law because we were talking about this earlier. The new tax law seems to be throwing some of the players and owners a curve ball, if you will. It could make it so that clubs face higher capital gains taxes for trading highly paid players. This is something that I didn't think about initially when we were looking at the tax plan, but how does this impact the teams and the players?</p><p>MANFRED: Well, it could really be an impediment to trades taking place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED: . particularly trades that happened quickly because of the requirement evaluation. We think it was a mistake, that it really was not intended to apply to trades of baseball players, and we're hopeful that when things get clarified in the technical corrections that we'll deal with that issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because it's not - I mean, you don't think of a trade of a player being the same as capital gains trading stocks.</p><p>MANFRED: Well, if you think about the economics of it, right, I'm trading you something in return for something else. There's a very good argument that they should be treated of equal value, otherwise somebody's not acting rationally, which I don't think is the case with most of our clubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you been in touch with lawmakers on this issue?</p><p>MANFRED: We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MANFRED: We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they're looking at it. They're aware that maybe there were unintended consequences.</p><p>MANFRED: Yes, there's a large list of things. Obviously, we have a couple of issues in the tax bill that we have been in touch with lawmakers about and hope they get clarified.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rob, the league is working to finalize a two-game series between the Yankees and the Red Sox at London's Olympic Stadium. Let's talk about that. This would be the American baseball's first regular season games in Europe. Pretty exciting stuff.</p><p>MANFRED: Very exciting for us. We feel that Europe's a frontier that we need to get to. We want to get there with our very best. We think a Yankee-Red Sox series will be very exciting and give us a foothold in Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the streaming deals? This is an important piece of business right now for the league. You've got streaming deals with Twitter, ESPN, Intel, YouTube, Facebook Watch also stepping up to the plate with a deal with the league. The exclusive stream, 25 games. Tell us about this.</p><p>MANFRED: Well, being on the cutting edge of technology has been really good for our business on the development of Bantech (ph), the sale of that asset to Disney, and we feel that these streaming deals are really important in terms of capturing the next generation of fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to because that's where a lot of people watch the game, on their phone.</p><p>MANFRED: Absolutely. Look, the next generation wants to see their favorite sport, and we hope it's baseball, on a variety of different platforms, and our strategy has been to make the game available on those platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but you said it earlier, you see more people in the stands that before, right? Are you having a hard time getting people in their seats because they're watching it on streaming?</p><p>MANFRED: Well, it's amazing. We had 114 million people went to see baseball live last year, minor league and major league baseball. That's a phenomenal number for us. Our ballpark experience is a little different than our broadcast experience. There's a certain commradery to it. There's all the entertainment that goes on in the ballpark, and fortunately our attendance has remained really stable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And lots of giveaways when you're in the field.</p><p>MANFRED: That's right. Those promotional nights are very popular with our fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rob, it's great to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MANFRED: It's great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good luck with opening day. We will be watching.</p><p>MANFRED: All right, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: MLB Commissioner, Rob Manfred, there. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018032602cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYN-VV81-DXH2-63FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 26, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

I am Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome all of you here in New York and those of you joining us by webcast to Eaton's 2015 Investor Conference. I'd like to draw your attention to a couple of items before we start, before I turn the podium over to our speakers. The first thing I'd like to do is talk a little bit about the agenda. As you can see, we have a robust agenda today and we are confident that you will find it both informative and insightful. Today, we start with comments from <person><nameText>Sandy Cutler, </nameText></person>our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and CFO, on some corporate items and those are followed by the industrial sector presentations and our electrical sector presentations.</p><p>You'll have three opportunities during today's meeting to be able to pose questions. At the end of both the industrial sector presentations and the electrical sector presentations, we will open the floor for questions. In addition, after lunch, we will be taking questions after the lunch session. We will be breaking at 10:15 for a short break. For those of you joining us by Webcast, when we break for lunch, we will readjourn for the question-and-answer session via the webcast approximately 30 minutes after we break.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to draw your attention to our comments on both our forward-looking statements and our use of any non-GAAP measures. Take a moment to read it; it is in your packet. It's also on the website and the materials are covered in more depth on our 10-K filed on February 26, 2015. With that, I'll turn the floor over to Sandy.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER, </nameText></person>CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Thanks, Don. Let me add my own welcome to all of you who are here this morning, as well as those of you who are on the webcast. We appreciate the time you are going to spend with us this morning. We think we've got a really exciting morning to give you insights both on our current performance and our future-looking prospects. So I once again appreciate your commitment of time.</p><p>I want to cover four themes with you to kick things off and as you saw from the agenda that Don shared with you, we are going to put the primary time this morning on helping you gain some additional insights into both businesses and market conditions that you've had a number of questions about over the last several months. So let me hop right in on the first one here talking about our power management strategy. For those of you who have followed our Company for some time, you know that we have really aligned our Company around the issue of power. And we are able to supply power using three important technologies -- electrical, fluid or Hydraulics and mechanical technologies -- to serve a series of high power consuming industries.</p><p>The reason we think that is important is that regulations and sustainability continue to drive adoption of advanced technologies. Those advanced technologies require a very active R&amp;D stream and I'll share more with you on that and it gives to us the opportunity really to maintain very strong margins through the cycle. At a time when oil prices have backed off, what is interesting to see is that customers are still looking for sustainable solutions that over the long term offer them the opportunity to reduce their energy costs and utilize energy and power safely.</p><p>I think you are all aware that we organize our Company into two sectors -- our electrical sector led by Tom Gross, our industrial sector led by Craig Arnold -- and within those businesses maybe just a couple quick introductory comments. You will hear much more about them as we go through the morning's agenda. In our electrical business, post our acquisition of Cooper, we now offer complex solutions all the way from generation onto end-user applications. We can compete head-up with anyone around the world and we are really delighted with the increased breadth of that operation.</p><p>Within our industrial sector three businesses, Hydraulics serving a broad array of activities and end markets. We'll talk more about those this morning. Our Aerospace business serving virtually every commercial aircraft manufacturer in all NATO-aligned countries in terms of their military operations and our Vehicle business serving that complex array of solutions that help fuel economy, as well as uptime and safety across both commercial vehicles and passenger or light vehicles.</p><p>We have been fairly clear about our strategy since 2000. I just want to do a very quick reprise of what that strategy was, what our goals were, what the strategy was and what we've done to execute that has really brought us today and another record year this last year with our earnings up some 13% in spite of relatively slow growth end markets. We said we had three goals when we started in on the transformation of the Company. The first was higher earnings growth, the second was reduced volatility in those earnings through the cycle and the third was while we were doing that to maintain a high return on capital, that we weren't simply going to take moves that diluted the return on our investors' money.</p><p>Our strategy was first to start by changing the mix fairly aggressively. Our portfolio today is very different than it was and within that portfolio, just as important, every year, we continue to make changes to move our assets toward higher return, higher growth businesses. We wanted to upgrade the talent significantly. You saw this was particularly a sharp change in the early 2000s. We brought a lot of people into Eaton to bring us to the opportunity to really run what we called an integrated operating company model. I'll talk more about that in just a minute.</p><p>But what you would see if you were inside Eaton today, you would Eaton University with over 30,000 people going through Eaton University every year. It is critical to how we train people for their careers, train additional competencies, certify people on being able to use the Eaton Business System, which is the third piece of the strategy, which was to run our business better. We were convinced we could run the Company again higher growth, reduced volatility, lower level of assets, but we needed to do so capturing the scale of what had become a bigger company. It is particularly true for companies who do a lot of acquisitions and as you can see if you move to the right side of this chart, we have done some 66 acquisitions. They are integrated; they operate on one model. We do not run what I will call a loosely affiliated holding company and we think that is how you capture scale in large-sized businesses.</p><p>We've also invested CAD5.5 billion in research over this time period. You will hear this morning again I think a really impressive array of new products being launched again this year that really bring to us again that opportunity for high margin, high growth and bringing those complex solutions to our customers that are really necessary to deliver on our promise of utilizing energy and power efficiently, safely and reliably and sustainably. And during this period of time, you can see with those 66 acquisitions we've spent some $20 billion of capital and we have successfully integrated those 66 acquisitions.</p><p>Let me turn a little bit to the issue of stability. I think as we all talk and you know very well right now, these are pretty volatile times. Whether you are looking at currency, whether you're looking at differential growth rates between countries or whether you are looking at the challenge of relatively low global growth, it becomes important that the portfolio of companies are one that can grow right through the economic cycle and not be dented by a change in one end market, but not be dented by a change in one geographic area and not be dented by the normal cycle that might go on if you were just in one business. That has been a hallmark of our strategy and we think it is continuing to prove to be an effective one for our investors.</p><p>If you look at this chart, we have talked to you quite a bit about wanting to get balance in our segment businesses and you can see we've got really quite a nice array of businesses that participate at different times of the economic cycle. You can see in that second one, we are just about perfectly balanced now, which was one of our objectives in terms of early, mid, late and then those businesses that tend to have a very strong aftermarket stream that tend not to have much of a cycle. That is critical when you are going through the economic cycle, so we are no longer an early cycle bet or a late cycle bet.</p><p>The lower one is one that has become particularly true and important to observe really since 2008. For all of you who were investing on the theme of emerging nations in the period of 2000 to 2007, clearly that has not been the winner since that period of time. Our strategy has been to get ourselves to 60% of our revenues outside of the US with the last 40% equally balanced between developed and emerging international economies.</p><p>What we have been able to do is in spite of the fact that the so-called BRIC have been a really disappointing story over the last couple of years, we have been able to still maintain very strong growth because of our balance. There will be a time driven again by the demographics and more political stability where a lot of the emerging nations' story will be a lot more attractive. That is not right now, but it will be in the feature and we continue to put down the important cornerstone investments in those economies to allow us to grow and take advantage of that.</p><p>And last but not least, certainly oil and gas is on everyone's mind today. A number of years ago, it was construction equipment, it was mining. You can think about different markets over time that fall into disfavor and others that are in favor. One of the advantages of Eaton is we are spread across a lot of end markets. We're not beholding to any one end market. That is a specific construct of our portfolio and our strategy. We again want to be able to move assets and move resources to advantaged end markets during the cycle and that is how we continue to have the opportunity to outgrow our end markets.</p><p>This chart is just a quick look at another cut at that issue. On the left side of the chart, what we've tried to do is simply by showing you a bright green or a plus or a minus for a market condition is to show you if you go through the businesses that we report externally and think about what had been the market conditions in individual years for these businesses, you will see that in every year there is some business that maybe isn't as strong as others, but the important piece of this is the balance by being represented across many businesses and across many end markets is what has allowed us on the right-hand side to drive 14% compound annual growth rate in terms of our operating earnings per share during this same time period. We think very strong earnings growth in a period of reduced end market growth, more currency volatility and clearly very differential results by end markets.</p><p>And then again if you ask the question of how that compares to our peers, our 13% increase in our operating earnings per share last year obviously compares very advantageously to the 7% to 8% of our peers and when we look again at that 2010 to 2015 time period, you can see we've outpaced our peers again. The strategy of breadth is working.</p><p>This is, of course, the long-term chart that we have shared with you on numerous occasions in terms of what our total shareholder return -- this obviously includes dividend reinvestment -- in this process has worked. Clearly we did not have as good a year last year. It is the first year of negative return except during the recession we've had. We are pleased that we are off recovering most of that already this year and we think the strategy over this time period really is working.</p><p>Let me turn to the third segment in terms of what I wanted to highlight for you this morning. It's our view on the economy. Not much new here and not much that you don't already appreciate. This post-2008 period of time burdened by the recovery from a liquidity-driven recession and the instability and high interest rate environments in many of the emerging nations is leading to a lower growth market. A fundamental reset has occurred. For the companies who have not put the strategy in place to deal with a reset, this becomes a very difficult environment.</p><p>You heard us coming out of the recession that our game plan for the five years forward after that was that we thought things would grow slower. In fact, it has grown a little slower than even we thought. We do think that this is the new normal. It is one that we've got to adjust to and we do believe we've got the plan put in place and that is fully reflected in our guidance for this year. The piece that I think is different and if you recall that we talked about it, if I could just hearken back to that previous chart, is we said that we thought we would see more currency instability. We thought it would occur earlier as you had differential rates of growth around the world.</p><p>That reset is clearly in full flow at this point and if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter and obviously what has happened in the first quarter, while it may have been a year or two later than we thought, we are in a period of really differential what I will call disintermediation of currency rates that are starting to make the growth rates around the country -- around the world -- make more sense. There will be more of this. We've taken about a 4% hit is on our forecast for this year in terms of impact on the top line from currency valuation. This is another issue that companies need to learn to deal with and still create earnings growth.</p><p>One of the fundamental ways we are doing that is what we've often called our self-help story. Our view if you go back to 2011 and 2012 was that these next couple of years were going to be a period of slow growth and if you grow your top line say at 3%, you can grow your bottom line at 6%, while that was attractive performance, that wasn't really attractive in the minds of investors and you needed to have another piece of your strategy, which would allow you to supercharge your earnings to get more toward that 10% type growth per year.</p><p>That strategy was the Cooper acquisition for us. Not only did it strengthen our electrical business and give us breadth and put us into new applications and strengthen us around the world, but it also supplied to us four successive years of substantial synergy savings. You can see them arrayed on this chart. The first year, $115 million; the next year, an incremental $95 million; the next year, an incremental $150 million. That's this year. And remember, next year, there's another $115 million incremental coming in 2016. A really successful acquisition. You will hear more about some of the key elements of that integration. We are absolutely on track or slightly ahead of schedule and it is producing all the results that we hoped that it would.</p><p>Now in the meantime, organic growth remains very important. It is the majority of our long-term growth plan. While we can have acquisitions, they are not the main feed at the table. They are a portion of our overall growth strategy and the investments we've been making through this period of time, even though it has been relatively slow growth, are important. If you go back to 2000, we had two global innovation centers. These are big R&amp;D and innovation centers in the world, both in the US. Today, we have six with two in the US. Clearly, we are accessing talent around the world and we are developing product and innovation for local markets and the configurations and the functions and the cost base you need to succeed in those individual marketplaces.</p><p>You can see we are spending nearly $700 million on R&amp;D, but more important than the dollars is really just -- I'll give you a quick capsule of kind of the results on the right-hand side. Over 10,000 engineering professionals around the world for Eaton now. That is a real army of highly creative talented men and women who are really making a difference for us in the front end of our businesses. Patent applications last year up 13% again. First issue patents up 27%. Eaton is doing important work in the area of power management and our customers feel it.</p><p>This is just a very quick look at just four of the recent introductions in this area. You're going to hear a lot more about many others here today. In our electrical sector, our variable frequency drives, and for those of you who know the characteristics when one starts an electric motor, there's a huge inrush; energy utilization is ineffective at that point. We've got now a complete line of variable frequency drives. You'll hear a little bit more about it this morning, really exciting. We took advantage of our Powerware acquisition to utilize the power semiconductor knowledge that came out of all the engineers working on UPS to be able to redeploy people in addition to doing UPS to develop a whole line of drives. That's an example of an integrated operating company being able to build on strength in one area and take it into another.</p><p>You've heard Tom Gross speak the last couple of years about when we did the Moeller acquisition in 2008. We acquired a very complete array of IEC components. What we didn't get were IEC assemblies. And what we've been working very hard on is bringing out the assemblies. These are the large structures and integrated capabilities to serve big jobs, if you will, in the market whether industrial or commercial. We now have those products and are really starting to push that around the world.</p><p>If I switch to our industrial side, many of you know Eaton has traditionally been much stronger in the heavy-duty application Class 8 truck market. Our relative participation in the medium-duty market has been lower in that regard. You'll hear Craig talk today about our Procision dual clutch technology that we are taking this year into the medium-duty North American market to allow us to significantly increase our marketshare and really make a difference for our customers in terms of performance. We're really excited about this product.</p><p>And in our Aerospace business, you will hear Uday Yadav this morning talk a little bit about here is just an example of the kind of technology we have in our seals capability that is allowing people to develop engines that deal with lower friction, higher heat and obviously better operating performance over time.</p><p>But it's not just about products. It's also got to be serving the right customers and how we go about serving them. Our channel partnerships are incredibly important to us and you're going to hear from Revathi Advaithi this morning about what we are doing in a relatively unique way to significantly improve our sales through our North American electrical channel process. It's not really in our electrical business. Real success is in Hydraulics in Asia this last year. We've talked to you about the volatility that occurs on the OEM side of the business. One of the important things is to build the stationary and distributor-oriented side of the business. As you can see, some 100 new distributors in Asia just in the last year in that respect.</p><p>Customers want to deal in a digital environment today. Every one of us who buys clothes or any other retail product are very used to click and order. That's not generally how the industrial markets work today. What we have launched across Eaton and will be rolling out the next three years we think sets the standard in the industry in terms of a digital contemporary experience for engineers that are a whole other generation than the ones that used to look at books and charts and specifications. This is a fundamental investment in doing business differently and it goes across all of our businesses.</p><p>Then last but not least, as markets ebb and get stronger, all these individual small markets, we want the ability to be able to move people to key segments that are strong. Let me give you a current example of being able to focus in that regard. The machine-building marketplace is getting stronger again. It's an area where we have electrical and hydraulic applications. It is unique within an integrated operating company that we can move people quickly and we can bring people from different franchises to emphasize where points of opportunity are that are stronger than others during the cycle.</p><p>Now all that comes together in terms as we think about our 2015 guidance. Clearly, if you were listening to companies in the December time period, many multinationals were talking about FX guidance for the year of 2015 maybe denting the top line by 1% or 2%. As we got into January, you started to hear people talk early in the month about 2%, 3%. By the end of the month, most people were in the 4% to 5% and we think it will impact us by 4% this year. That's about $900 million on the top line that it impacts us this year. But we have to find a way to create operating earnings.</p><p>What you can see on that lower chart is that our operating earnings-per-share guidance this year at the midpoint is up 5% compared to last year. Without the FX and then, of course, we told you in our gardens that our tax rate is going to be approximately 9% to 11% this year. Last year without the special items it was approximately 6%. That increase obviously is a drag this year as well and has been consistent with what we had indicated all through the second half of last year, really no change as we got to our guidance this year. Without those two items, we are driving 13%.</p><p>What makes that possible? What makes that possible is that additional $150 million of synergy savings plus the $35 million of additional benefits that came out of the restructuring that we did last year in the industrial sector. That's the self-help story that is allowing us to continue to drive strong earnings during a period of weak end-market demand, substantial FX currency valuation change and the fact that our tax rate is moving up through this time period.</p><p>Let me talk about maybe the big news I think for 2015. In 2012, when we announced at EPG in late May that we are acquiring Cooper, we said we would be out of the M&amp;A market for probably about three years. And we thought it would be about the middle of 2015 until we had completed most of the decisions and most of the integration for the Cooper business and had made the biggest portion of the progress to paying down our debt. So we call that sort of the financial capacity. Once we are fishing up the integration, our management capacity would return to again potentially enter the M&amp;A market.</p><p>As you can see, we've had very strong growth in cash from operations during this time period, 23% compound growth rate. That has been primarily applied to paying down the $2.1 million of the $4.9 million of the debt that we took on to acquire Cooper. You can see on the right side our free cash flow has really improved as well. We continue to spend on R&amp;D. We continue to spend on CapEx. We are not cutting any of those things back, but you are starting to see the scale and the profitability of the Company that really is making this happen.</p><p>As a result, as we look forward I have shared with you the middle of 2015 becomes a pretty important decision time for the Company. I think that's really good news for investors. We are now just four or five months away from that. We were 2.5 years away from it when we talked in May, so it felt -- in May 2012 -- so it felt relatively inapplicable at that time and what we've tried to show you just on the left-hand side is a representation of rough approximations -- this is not guidance -- this is a rough approximation of the second half of 2015 and an early look at 2016 in terms of cash flows to give you some dimension as to what is going to be the amount of cash that we might apply in terms of optionality. And if you go to that right-hand column that says capital optionality, approximately $1.5 billion to maybe $1.65 billion of cash that we're going to need to apply to something during that time period.</p><p>What are we going to apply it to? You saw us buy back $650 million of shares in the second half of this last year. We had not planned on doing that originally. We were able to do that earlier than we thought. But we think it is likely to be a mixture of you saw us increase the dividend early this week, 12%. We think going forward it is likely to be a mixture again of these three things -- of continued strong dividend increases, some mixture of share buyback and potentially M&amp;A if we find the right particular transactions. We will be able to share more with you as we get to the middle of this year. So by conclusion, we really think the power management strategy is working; it's effective. It provides the stability we are looking for. It is allowing us to drive earnings during a difficult set of end conditions and we are positioned now I think for that next step for the Company around cash deployment.</p><p>The balance of this morning, Rick is going to give you a quick update on 2014 highlights, a look into more detail in terms of our guidance for this year. We are then going to switch to what we would all call kind of the meat of the morning. Craig is going to give you a view overall for the industrial sector and then Uday Yadav is going to join you and talk a little bit about our Aerospace business. Then the electrical business, Tom is going to set the sort of overall summary and then you are going to hear about the sales channel integration and strategy, such an important part of the Cooper business by Revathi Advaithi, who runs our Americas area for our overall electrical business. Frank Campbell is going to tell you about some of the new product innovation and reasons for real excitement around the vitality. Frank runs our EMEA region for our electrical business and then Mark Eubanks, who runs our lighting business, is going to share with you some really exciting insights around the LED revolution that is going on in the marketplace today and how we are really very advantageously positioned. So with that, let me turn things over to Rick and we will continue the morning. Thanks again for being here this morning.</p><p>RICK FEARON, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; CFO &amp; CHIEF PLANNING OFFICER, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Thanks, Sandy. I'm going to spend 20 minutes and take you quickly through a recap of 2014, talk a little bit, as well as some of the longer term trends. Then talk in some more detail about the cash optionality decision and some of the options that we are going to face in the middle of the year and then give you a little more granularity on some aspects of our 2015 guidance.</p><p>This shows you over the last decade three key measures of the growth that we have had -- sales growth 9%, cash from operations 12%, operating EPS 8%. This is in an environment that has been incredibly volatile. If you look at the average of GDP growth over this 10 years, it's actually been 2.8% globally. Now, obviously, a lot faster prior to the Great Recession. Then you took a step backwards in the Great Recession and since then, we are in this new normal period and unfortunately, it appears that that is what we are likely to see over the next few years, which makes generating your own growth ever more important.</p><p>One of the things that we have been focused on as part of Cooper is, and one of the reasons we are interested in Cooper as an acquisition candidate was we believed that it would provide greater earnings stability, one of the goals that Sandy talked about. I thought I would share a couple of measures of that to give you some insight into this earnings stability.</p><p>On the left side, I'm looking at the range of EBIT margin over this ten-year time period and what we've done is looked at Eaton and Cooper pro forma together over that 10-year time period. And as you see, we have one of the more stable EBIT margins compared to our peers and in fact, if I were to show you Eaton standalone, we would have been, as a standalone entity, in the half to a little bit above half towards the higher end of that chart. So Cooper has definitely given us more margin stability.</p><p>Another way to look at it would be to look at EBIT growth. And so what we've done here is looked at EBIT growth over the time period prior to the acquisition of Cooper, looked at Eaton standalone, looked at Eaton and Cooper together and as you see, the volatility of the growth of EBIT is about 20% less Eaton/Cooper combined. So Cooper definitely has given us more earnings stability and you are seeing that.</p><p>2014 was a record year and sometimes it is hard as all of you do focusing mainly upon quarters to step back and look at that. But if you look at just a few parameters, I think it will show what a strong year it was. 13% operating EPS growth, $4.67. Now that was almost exactly the midpoint of the guidance that we gave at the start of 2014. That midpoint was $4.70. 15.3% segment operating margin, up 40 basis points from the prior year and $2.53 billion cash from operations and that compares to $2.28 billion in the year prior. And we closed in a strong way with core growth of 5%, our strongest quarter of core sales growth since 2011.</p><p>If you look at the cash that we gave back to shareholders, $650 million of repurchases, $929 million of dividends paid and of course, the 12% dividend increase our Board enacted on Wednesday bringing our dividend to $0.55 a quarter. And I would also point out that we have taken away risk from future growth. We have paid down debt to the tune of $582 million. We are approaching our target capital structure, not yet there, but we will be there in about a year from now. And then, lastly, we resolved some long-standing litigation, the Meritor, the Frisby suits and that took nonbusiness risk off the table. So a year of great accomplishment, one that we are very proud of.</p><p>Turning to cash optionality, Sandy showed you the growth in cash from operations over the last five years. That was, of course, void by coming out of the Great Recession. If you look over this longer period of time though, it has grown about 10%. So a strong rate of cash from operations growth. We have grown the dividend during that same time period at 14%. Quite an attractive rate I think if you compare the rate of our dividend increase compared to most of our peers. And as you see, that has been a pretty steady progression over this ten-year period.</p><p>That dividend increase has allowed us to pay a good yield, a high yield on our shares. Our yield prior to the increase last Wednesday was about 2.7%. Today, it is over 3%, so a strong running dividend yield. The middle chart shows you the repurchases. We ramped them up across last year as we saw opportunities to use some excess cash to take advantage of weakness in our share price and in total, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to our shareholders last year. That is 4.4% of the market cap of Eaton at the start of 2014. I think that's a real testament to the shareholder orientation of the Company.</p><p>This shows you our remaining debt paydown schedule connected to the Cooper transaction. When we did the transaction, met with credit providers, met with the rating agencies, we made a commitment that we would reduce our long-term debt from the close of the transaction by $2.1 billion. We have $1.2 billion left to pay down, $400 million in the second quarter and that is $300 million in April and $100 million in June. And then another $600 million in early November. And we will then close off this debt paydown schedule with $240 million maturity in the middle of January.</p><p>So we are actually only about 11 months away from having completed this paydown and what that will do is that that leaves us with an amount of long-term debt that we believe, at our present size, is appropriate for the long-term capital structure of the Company. Obviously, as the Company grows, there potentially is the ability to have a bit more long-term debt, but we will be in what we regard as a stable situation by January of next year.</p><p>And if you step back and think about our capital deployment over the last -- or since the start of this decade, since 2010, this is I think a useful way to think about it. In the 2010 through 2012 time period, we deployed about $17.5 billion of capital. And the majority, the great majority of that deployment was in acquisitions. We spent over $14 billion on acquisitions; Cooper, of course, being the largest at about $13 billion. And then other deployment to CapEx, dividends, etc. and a tiny bit of debt paydown.</p><p>If you look at what we have been doing in 2013, 2014 and will be doing in 2015, it is largely a balance sheet repair period. We will have devoted the largest portion of our money to paying down debt, but we also will have maintained attractive dividend and fully funded all of the capital spending needs of the business, as well as opportunities to pursue new product introductions.</p><p>Looking into 2016 to 2018 then, that large amount of money that has been spent on debt paydown is no longer going to be needed for such and so we're going to have the ability to change focus and redeploy that for growth -- shareholder growth-enhancing activities whether it be repurchase, whether it be M&amp;A and we are actively giving thought to just what our strategy should be over the next year and a half from the middle of this year and we will update you on that when we get to the middle of the year.</p><p>Let me talk a little bit more about our 2015 guidance just to give you some understanding of how we see this year turning out. As Sandy talked about, global growth has definitely downshifted to a lower trajectory. So-called new normal. The growth of global GDP this year we estimate to be about 2.8%, so very much typical of the kind of growth that we are likely to see. And with that global number that is fairly moderate, you're going to see a fair amount of variation around the world. The United States we think will be one of the higher growing parts of the world, certainly the highest growing developed part of the world at 2.9% and that compares to 2014 GDP in the US of 2.4%. You may have seen they just revised down the Q4 US GDP number at 8:30 this morning to 2.2% for the fourth quarter of last year.</p><p>Brazil, we had thought as we were coming into our planning for the year that it might have modest growth, but with the issues that Brazil is confronting, the issues around commodity prices, some of the political issues that they are dealing with, we now think that you are looking at a modest decline in Brazil of 1% to 1.5%. Europe, 1.5% will be the best year in many years for Europe and it is really a reflection of several things. It's a reflection of the euro having declined about 20% and we are definitely seeing that in export orders out of Europe. In fact, if you looked at German export orders for Germany as a whole in January, that was the highest month ever for export orders from Germany. So you are definitely seeing some rebound in Europe. China downshifting growth a bit. Still a very high rate of growth, but certainly not what it was five, six years ago. And in India, growth seems to be picking up, which is a good thing and definitely an opportunity for us.</p><p>So that's the world that we are living in and within that world, we believe that we will be able to generate core or organic growth -- we use those words somewhat interchangeably -- of 3% to 4%. And I have arrayed for you the core growth differences between the segments. Hydraulics will have the lowest core growth or perhaps a slight core decline related to the downturns in some of its markets, namely large ag and Chinese construction equipment. Vehicle will have the highest growth we believe and the rest are in between.</p><p>And then on the right side, and I'm not going to go through each of these individual bullet points, but I've tried to array the growth expectations we have for some of the key markets that affect the core growth in each of our segments. So at your leisure, you can take a look at that. We expect good margin improvement in 2015 and that is consistent really with the long-term trend. So if you look at our segment margins starting back in 2000, and you see it has been on a nicely uptrend over this 15-year period, we expect our margins at the segment level to increase 60 to 120 basis points in 2015 and that is from the 15.3% margin that we had in 2014.</p><p>Now our cash earnings are even stronger than our GAAP earnings. And so I thought I would show you a comparison just to give you some insight into that. On the left side, with operating EPS in 2014 of $4.67, we had EBITDA per share of $7.52. And with a midpoint of $4.90 per share operating earnings in 2015, we expect that you are going to have a number for EBITDA per share that is going to be between $8 and $8.05. So a very attractive cash profile.</p><p>One of the questions we sometimes get is cash conversion ratios, how does free cash flow compare to GAAP earnings and I thought I would give you some insight into that. In general for 2015, we think cash conversion is likely to be about 100% and in 2014, it was a little less than that at about 90% and a simple way to think about that is that our non-cash amortization of intangibles is a little over $400 million a year. If you think about what happens to that non-cash amortization, it gets whittled down quite a bit by several factors. First of all, in 2015, we are planning to spend about $110 million more on CapEx than is our depreciation. And the reason for that is capacitizing new facilities, capacitizing new programs so that we can take advantage of growth opportunities.</p><p>Secondly, our pension contribution is going to be a bit higher than pension expense this year. Now compared to 2014, there was a bigger gap in 2014, but there still will be some gap in 2015 and as I'll show you in a second, however, that gap is likely to be eliminated pretty quickly given how well-funded our pension plan is right now.</p><p>And then, lastly, we think there will still be a little bit of gap between cash taxes and book taxes in 2015. We think that gap will be less than the gap was in 2014 and then there are a few other very small items where you will have a little bit of an imbalance between cash and book. That is how you walk from this non-cash amortization over to roughly around 100% free cash flow of GAAP earnings.</p><p>In terms of our pension plan, our US qualified plan, that is about two-thirds of our pension liability and it's about 90% of the liability that has to be funded. We have liabilities and many countries, there are no funding requirements and so you pay as you go. If I look at where we were at the end of 2014 and I've taken a little bit of liberty. We made a $200 million contribution the second day in January, so I have added that in and we are 85% funded then at the end of 2014, $570 million underfunded. And that reflects two negatives in that calculation. First, the new mortality tables and those mortality tables reduced or increased our underfunded status by $143 million just from the mortality tables and secondly, the discount rate going from 4.7% to 4.0%. So even with those two fairly significant negatives, still 85% funded and as a sensitivity, I think it is helpful to note that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate improves the fund-in level by 5 percentage points. So if you had a 150 basis point increase in the discount rate, you would be fully funded.</p><p>And the bottom shows you how the discount rates changed over time. It was 7.75% in 2000. As recently as 2010, it was at that 5.5% that would allow us to be fully funded. Then if you look over on the right side, I've tried to show US qualified plan funding as a percentage of cash flow and you see how that has dropped dramatically from 16% down to 7% this year.</p><p>One other comment I thought you might find helpful is if indeed you had a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, just to give you a sensitivity to earnings, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase our earnings by $75 million. That's essentially a reduction in pension expense of $75 million, so it would also impact the P&amp;L.</p><p>This is our guidance slide. It has not changed from what we went over with you in January. The 3% to 4% organic revenue growth, negative 4% ForEx and the segment margins are all the same as we talked with you in January. What I thought I would do though would be to give you a little color on the first quarter because I think you all might find that helpful. Generally, we find on the revenue side in the first quarter that first-quarter revenues are the weakest revenues of the year just for seasonality reasons, some of which are related to weather. But this year, we are also finding that there's a significant foreign exchange negative from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.</p><p>So if you think about the normal downturn from Q4 to Q1, you add on the FX negative because exchange rates really accelerated all throughout Q4 so you didn't really see the full impact by any means of this exchange rate slide in Q4. In total, we think that revenues in Q1 are going to be about 5% under revenues in Q4, so that is a good way to think about that as you model that out. If you look at our margins in Q1, we believe that at the segment level they will be between 14.5% and 15.0% and the reason they will be suppressed a little bit is that, as Craig will talk about, we are doing some restructuring actions in Hydraulics and those restructuring costs are reducing in particular the Hydraulics margins in the first quarter.</p><p>And so in summary, we have had solid results over a long period and are very well-positioned for the future. Strong and predictable earnings growth. We've got a lot of cash optionality. We are returning a lot of cash to shareholders and the self-help strategy that Sandy described and we've been pursuing is delivering solid growth in what I think we all agree is a slowing global environment.</p><p>With that, let me turn it over to Craig and I'd be happy to answer any questions at the break.</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; COO, INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Thanks, Rick. Appreciate it. So I guess I should say welcome to the meat of the morning, which is the expression my boss used. I'm not sure if I like the analogy of being considered the meat of the morning. It conjures up images of a bunch of lions and tigers and bears in the audience, but, oh my, yes. But a couple of the other things that he said that certainly resonate with me and are consistent with kind of the story that you are going to hear from us in our industrial businesses is that Sandy said our power management strategy is working. He also said that the stability that we have and the balance that we have in our Company has essentially allowed us to grow our earnings as a company through the cycle and to outperform our peers.</p><p>And so my job today and Uday's job today and when he comes up behind me is to show you how the industrial businesses are an important part of that success. And in fact, we strongly believe that if you take a look at each of our businesses, each of our businesses do have the ability and have historically been the engine of earnings growth inside of the Company at some point in the cycle. You are certainly seeing that today quite frankly in our Vehicle business if you take a look at how they performed in 2014 and our guidance in 2015.</p><p>So that's essentially what we're going to try to take you through and what we're going to try to do in our presentations is anticipate mainly the questions that you have written about and that we think you have about our business. But first just a quick level set, if you will. As a power management company, as Sandy talked about, we are on the side of fluid and mechanical power. But if you step back from that, the way to think about our business is that really we do tough stuff. We take on difficult tasks that need to be safe and that need to be reliable and that is really one of the key themes that really cuts through all of our businesses both on the industrial side and certainly on the electrical side as well.</p><p>If you think about our Hydraulics business in an application like a wind turbine, for example, where we are doing the control of the blades, pitch control and directional control, 300 feet in the air, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and it absolutely needs to be reliable. If you look at our Vehicle business, certainly a key supplier to the transportation industry, but I would tell you more than that, we make engineer management products and inside of the engine, our valves see temperatures that exceed 700 degrees Fahrenheit and millions of cycles and have to be reliable and can't fail.</p><p>Many of you have been on the road behind one of these big Class 8 trucks, probably a little frustrated. We like those things. But these trucks, we actually warrantee them for about 750,000 miles. By the way, and there is no maintenance required. They have to be reliable. And to say that our Aerospace business is mission-critical maybe is a little bit of an understatement, but on everything that flies, our hydraulic systems and our fuel systems are essentially there through takeoff, cruise at landing and absolutely have to be safe and have to be reliable.</p><p>Anybody ever been on a plane that was delayed due to a mechanical? Probably most of us. So dispatch reliability is obviously one of the keys in that industry and certainly if you think about what makes our Company unique, it is in fact that we bring value, we bring unique technology to all of these big challenges.</p><p>And we do think there's some tailwinds that we have if you think about some of the big megatrends that will help our businesses. But we will in fact see different patterns in 2015 and have different expectations for our businesses during the course of the year. We will have a year in 2015 where Vehicle will be strong again. Aerospace will see modest growth and we'll have some challenges in Hydraulics and we will talk about that. So we don't expect all of these businesses to perform consistently in the same, but the balance that they bring to the Company through the cycle is in fact one of the key strengths of this portfolio.</p><p>Sandy talked about our formula for creating value and our formula for creating value really hasn't changed. It really is centered on these three things. It's about being in the right markets not only as a company but within each of our businesses. We consistently look at our portfolio and make sure that within the segments that we serve that we are focused on those aspects and segments and applications that are growing faster. And we are investing to outgrowth, we're making tough trade-offs and differentiated decisions around the portfolio and where we invest, which markets, which applications, which regions of the world.</p><p>And we are focused on running the business better. And in this period of slow growth, perhaps the most important thing that we can do is in this area of self-help, the things that we are doing, things that are inside of our control, things that we have today in our hand that we can do to grow revenue, to improve earnings, all built on the back of the Eaton Business System, the standard system that we use for running each of our businesses and running each of our functions and the way we create value inside of our organization.</p><p>But maybe just a couple more slides to talk about the Eaton Business System and how we apply it inside of our business. And I do think you can think about the Eaton Business System really as Eaton's self-help story. The things that we can do that are in our control that allow us to both improve the efficiency, the way we run our Company and to help us grow. And we think about it typically in these three buckets. It's about costs and improving efficiency for sure. It's about operational excellence. It's also about functional excellence and it's about the way we work with customers and getting more out of our existing relationships.</p><p>Now inside of these three buckets, I'll drop you down just to one particular example in one of our manufacturing plants to give you a sense for the way it works. Every one of our manufacturing plants are essentially run the same way. We have a common set of measures, a common set of tools, a common set of processes and essentially a common set of goals for each of our businesses. All of this built on a culture and a foundation of continuous improvement, something that we expect every one of our facilities to do day in and day out. And we have at least five key metrics in every plant and it's about safety and quality and on-time delivery and getting costs out for our customers and quality. And every one of our facilities is actually benchmarked against what does world-class look like, what does best in breed look like. And so every facility that you would go to would actually have a benchmark that says here is where you are performing today, here is what best-in-class looks like and that is the goal, to get every one of our facilities to perform as good as the best of our facilities.</p><p>And we're certainly proud of the fact that we had 14 sites in 2014 make world-class metrics in the industrial sector and a number of others on the electrical side, but we are even more excited about the opportunity that it represents for our Company. If we can simply get each of our facilities to perform as good as our best facilities, the amount of self-help, the amount of value that we can create for our Company and for shareholders is tremendous. And I just cited one small example here in quality, the cost of quality. We are not perfect today. We are good, but we are not perfect. But by simply getting each of our facilities on the industrial sector to perform as good as our better facilities, not perfect, we unlock at least a $60 million opportunity to improve margin. So it is self-help. It's the Eaton Business System. It's the things that we can do to control our own destiny.</p><p>Now it's also about the way we run our Company. It's about the things that we do to improve efficiency in our plants, in our support functions and it's also about the things that we have to do from time to time to reset our business based upon changes in our market. And you certainly saw in the course of 2014 we took some restructuring actions. And in hindsight, we are pleased that we did. We made the right early call that we were going to, in fact, see some challenges in a number of our end markets and so we will deliver the $35 million of benefits that we promised in 2014 based upon the restructuring actions that we took.</p><p>But we have to do more. I specifically have to do more and it probably doesn't come as a surprise to anyone here that it will in fact be centered in the Hydraulics business. If you take a look at what is happening in some of their big end markets, whether it is global ag, whether it is mining, whether it is China construction or recently oil and gas, clearly, we have to do some work to reset that business in terms of the current realities that we are dealing with in our marketplace. And so we will be taking some charges in the first half of this year. A lot of that will be centered and as Rick indicated in the first quarter, but the good news is there will be about 70 basis points of margin improvement that will roll into 2016. So even at these very low levels of economic activity and really in some cases awful end markets, our margins will expand by order of magnitude of 70 basis points in 2016 in Hydraulics with no lift in revenue.</p><p>So let's move directly into Hydraulics. And I won't spend a lot of time on this chart; I think you can read it. It's pretty much self-explanatory. But I will say maybe as a way of thinking about the business, we see our Hydraulics business today as a good business. It's a good business today dealing with some pretty awful markets, but recognizing that, we understand also that there are elements of this business that are volatile. And I'll talk about in a subsequent slide, we think about 30% of the business tends to serve volatile markets.</p><p>So we have to be proactive. We have to deal with the element of volatility and flexing our business, but we also have to grow the piece of the business that is not volatile and about 70% of the business is in a category that we call stable. So we are focused on doing the things that we know we need to do to restructure the business where needed, to grow the stable side of the business and to make sure that we are doing the things that are in the category of self-help to essentially make this a business that we can continue to be very proud of.</p><p>Many of you probably are thinking about this business also in the context of the Great Recession and you'll recall I used this same exact chart last year. And so what happened in the Hydraulics business, if you go back to the Great Recession, essentially all of the end markets basically fell at the same time and markets fell quite hard. And in hindsight, we saw a very steep V-shaped recovery and probably markets came back too fast. A lot of that was driven by stimulus spending around the world and in the US, but principally in places like China and China was the engine really that drove a lot of markets around the world.</p><p>On top of that, you clearly had commodity prices and mining that was on a ramp and it eventually fell over. You saw a super cycle in ag essentially crack during the course of 2014 and that market fell. And so without a doubt, we are dealing with, in this piece of the Hydraulics business, some really challenging market dynamics. But I will tell you that as we think about this business and where we are at this point in the cycle, we think a lot of the bad news around this volatile piece of the business is in fact behind us and as we look forward, we are not sure exactly when it is going to turn. It could be 2016, it could be into 2017, but clearly these markets are either at or approaching the bottom of the cycle and we think long term it continues to be an industry that grows at about 3% a year.</p><p>And so once again, a way to think about the business, it's a large market and in fact, there is a piece of the market that is volatile. And we think it's about 3% of the portfolio that is in fact exposed to large ag, China construction, a piece of oil and gas and that piece of the business is volatile. But I don't want to lose sight either of the other 70% of the business that is not volatile. It's a very big piece of this business whether it is material handling, it's industrial markets, it's stationary applications, it's a very big piece of aftermarket that is not volatile. And so we're going to be busy focusing on what we can do to grow naturally in this 70% of the business that is in fact more predictable and more stable. So it's really this 70% and the things that we're doing in the area of self-help that give us the confidence to say that we think this business, despite the headlines and what is going on in some of these markets, will essentially be anywhere from flat to down 2% during the course of 2015.</p><p>Now before we leave these volatile markets, I don't want to lose sight of the fact either that there is good news coming. Here are just three markets that we have modeled to give you a sense for where they are at today versus their peak. And as I noted, they may be at bottom today. If they are not at bottom, they are certainly approaching the bottom of the market and at some point these markets will turn. And they are likely not going to all turn at the same time, but when they do turn, there is significant revenue growth and earnings growth that will help power the top line and the bottom line of Hydraulics business. So you really are in fact approaching the bottom of a lot of these key markets and that is essentially good news as we look out into 2016 and 2017 inside of this business.</p><p>So as we think about our Hydraulics business, maybe the way to think about it is that, yes, we recognize the fact that there is a piece of the business that is volatile. It is some 30% of the business. But we are taking the steps that we need to take to essentially fix the business and ensure that we can operate effectively through these economic cycles, through these downturns and it's really a three-point strategy. It's about really growing the 70% of the business that is in fact stable. It's about improving the product mix and it's about taking the steps that we took last year and we will continue to take this year around getting the cost base right in the business.</p><p>And so here is the way we think about the business and think you should. At this point in the cycle, which we think is close to the bottom, it will be about a 13% to 14% business. At the midpoint in the cycle, we think that's roughly 15% to 16% and at the peak of the cycle, it is roughly 17% plus. And so we think a business that will continue to be a key contributor to Eaton's ability to grow earnings through the economic cycle.</p><p>One of the things that we are doing, we talked about growing the 70% is in fact focusing on one of the key markets here, which we call machinery OEMs and it is something that Sandy referenced in his presentation as well. Today, the hydraulics market is about a $40 billion global market, $15 billion of which is in what we call stationary equipment. $4 billion of that is in this segment, what we call machine-builders where we sell into the OEM market. This is a market that requires a lot of hydraulic equipment. It's a market that we serve today. Hydraulic pumps and motors and valves and fluid conveyance products, it's an important hydraulic market.</p><p>What's also unique about this market, it's also a market today that we are also serving on the electrical side of our business. And so we have a really unique capability. We are the only company who has the ability under one roof to bring both hydraulic and electrical solutions to these types of applications. And here is one small example here. As Sandy mentioned, the electrical variable speed drives that we have developed. So what we are doing here is we are taking all of our hydraulic equipment, we are marrying it up with an electric motor and a variable speed drive in our electrical business and we now have the ability to go to market and offer something that nobody else has and deliver a solution that is 70% more energy-efficient than other applications available in the marketplace. So a really unique opportunity that we have based upon our core strengths in Hydraulics and partnering with our electrical businesses to grow the stable 70% of the business in a really important market.</p><p>The other piece of growing the 70% is really a more keen focus on aftermarket. Aftermarket today is a large market. It's about a $12 billion market. It's very predictable. It grows at about 3% a year. We have an enormous installed base of equipment, some $18 billion of equipment out there with our Hydraulics components on it and it is a profitable business. It accounts for about a third of our revenue today and so we will continue to focus on growing our aftermarket, expanding our points of distribution. A lot of initiatives there in the US and around the world, building unique service capabilities and in many ways also localizing capabilities so that we can serve aftermarket opportunities around the world. So we think there's an opportunity here and we have good line of sight to actually growing the aftermarket business inside of our portfolio at a compounded rate of about 5% a year.</p><p>So in summary, I would tell you that the Hydraulics business today, we understand the business. We have been in it for a long time and we understand the uniqueness of the piece of the business that is volatile and we know how to manage and flex our business to deal with those ups and downs. We will in fact continue to focus on growing the stable 70% with new technology and new products and applications and most importantly we will continue to drive our self-help story around running our businesses better.</p><p>So, as you saw in the guidance, clearly it's a business where the margins will be down slightly in 2015 principally due to the restructuring charges that we are going to take and as Rick noted, we will take most of those restructuring charges in the first half of the year with a bigger concentration in Q1. So a way to think about the business is the first-half margins will be anywhere from 10.5% to 12.5% and then the second half anywhere from 13% to 13.6%.</p><p>So if we can just turn to Vehicle for a second, this is a business once again that I think this group knows well. It is a really strong franchise that is well-positioned in both automotive and truck markets. It's a business that today really wins due to technology, wins due to the fact that it is in fact a highly regulated market and so if it's about fuel economy or it's about emissions, if it's about safety, it really does play to the sweet spot of our Vehicle business.</p><p>And here too we say we're in the right markets and certainly at this point in the cycle being in a short cycle Vehicle business is in fact the right market and I won't cover these numbers here because Rick already covered a number of them, but certainly we look at North America truck to be a strong market again this year that global automotive markets around the world continue to be strong and Europe is actually on the positive side. So a really good set of markets that we are exposed to here in Vehicle and as a result, we think we are confident that our business will grow some 5% to 7% a year.</p><p>The other thing I talked about is the fact that this is a business that wins with new regulations. And if you take a look at what you see on this chart here, some of the more high-profile examples of regulation and it tends to be around fuel economy and reduced emissions, it's around safety, you see what is going to happen is they put fuel economy standards in for heavy-duty trucks, the piece on the automotive market is well known to this group. So when you see new regulations and requirements around the world, it is always a good thing for our Vehicle business because it does in fact play to the unique advantages of our technology.</p><p>One small example here in China in what we call here this on road vapor recovery system. In the US, for some time now, when you actually fill up your car, you've actually had to recover the fuel vapor that would be lost and would go into the atmosphere. China did not have a similar requirement, but in the course of 2014, they have adopted the US requirement and that is a great thing for Eaton because we have the leading technology in the US, we have the number one share position in the US and now overnight what opens up due to regulations is a $135 million market opportunity for us in the China market. So once again regulations driving opportunities for us to grow our Vehicle business.</p><p>The other big market for us is obviously NAFTA and specifically what is happening today in the area of automation. The heavy-duty truck market is rapidly converting to automation and it's driven by a lot of factors, including in some cases better fuel economy, in some cases safety, in many cases quite frankly, driver availability and automated transmissions that's simply easier to drive. But also we will acknowledge here that some of this shift is also being driven by vertical integration that many of you are aware of and have written about that is taking place in the North America Class 8 market.</p><p>As the market moves from manual to automation, yes, there comes some risk, but, yes, there also comes some opportunities and the big opportunity for us is the fact that an automated transmission actually sells for 40% to 50% more than a manual transmission. So as this market moves and we think the market moved about 8 points during the course of 2014, there is an element of this that is good for Eaton.</p><p>But the way to think about perhaps this whole vertical integration threat that we are dealing with in North America is that, yes, we probably on unit volume will give up some share to some of the vertically integrated OEMs, but offsetting that are a lot of positives, one of which is in fact the fact that an AMT is a good thing for us because we sell it at a much higher price and a number of the other initiatives that I'm going to talk about in subsequent slides.</p><p>Transmissions, it's a big market today. It's a $12 billion market. It's growing by 3% a year and we are not sitting still. We've done a lot of work over the last couple years to refresh our entire productline. Our heavy-duty transmission line has been essentially redone both in manual transmissions and in automated transmissions to the point that they are lighter weight now, they are delivering better fuel economy.</p><p>Many of you have read and seen articles on our Smart Advantage Transmission in partnership with Cummins and we'll talk about that, but perhaps most excitingly and Sandy mentioned this in his presentation is what is going on in the medium-duty space. This new transmission that uses our proprietary dual clutch technology and what that means in simple terms is you get the same driving experience that you would in driving your family car with an automatic transmission with the fuel economy advantages that you would get with a manual. And it is because we have this proprietary technology, we call it dual clutch, we call it Procision, that gives us an opportunity to enter a market that historically we have not played in. So we think this is about a $120 million revenue opportunity at maturity and one of the key things that we're going to do to continue to grow our North America truck business despite some of the pressures that we are seeing in other areas.</p><p>The other thing is what we are doing in the area of alliances. Many of you are probably aware if you follow the Company over the years is that we have had a long-standing joint venture with a company called Nittan Valve out of Japan and this particular joint venture essentially pursues the Japanese and Korean transplants around the world and it has been tremendously successful. This business has more than doubled over the last five years.</p><p>During the course of 2014, we also signed a joint venture, a clutch joint venture with the largest transmission manufacturer in China. We have the clutch product. We have the technology. They have the market. And so it's a unique venture that will allow us to penetrate the Chinese market in the space of clutches. And then our alliance with Cummins, and we have been working with Cummins now for many years, but the example that you see here is what we called Smart Advantage. It is basically taking a Cummins engine, putting an Eaton transmission behind it, but it's an optimized drivetrain and we belief that the Cummins/Eaton combination is as good as any drivetrain in the market. And as you can see here delivering anywhere from 3% to 6% improvement in fuel economy over other alternatives.</p><p>And I don't want to leave the stage without at least saying a word or two about our automotive business. It's clearly the leader in engineer management and has been for a long time. It's certainly a business that continues to benefit from regulations, continues to benefit as our customers try to deliver better fuel economy to reduce emissions and the way I would think about this business really is in really three technology buckets. It's what we are doing in the area of valves. And as the industry downsizes engines, downspeeds engines and engines run hotter, in comes a technology called hollow valves, and hollow valve is important for us because it's a valve that sells at a much higher selling price than a standard valve.</p><p>Or you move to variable valve actuation, varying the lift of the ignition event inside of an engine and once again we have technology that delivers fuel economy and reduced emissions or some of the newer solutions in cylinder deactivation where you basically take a six-cylinder engine car and you turn it into a four cylinder at various points in the driving process. So you've got a six cylinder where you need the power and it turns it into a four cylinder at cruise when you don't need the power. And in every case delivering improvements in fuel economy, reduction in emissions and quite frankly significant growth opportunities for our business.</p><p>And lastly, in Vehicle, something we don't spend a lot of time talking about is aftermarket. Today, we have a fairly sizable aftermarket business inside of our Vehicle business. It's about 15% of the total business today. We have an enormous installed base, more than 4.7 million vehicles out there on the road today and so we are working hard to grow this piece of our business. We're putting ignitions in place to really capture a secondary market with fleets, with developing channel programs, unique products to serve the aftermarket and so we think as well aftermarket is an important piece of what we're doing to continue to grow the business to control our own destiny and offset some of the headwinds that we face.</p><p>So I think we would stop here and say that our Vehicle business is a strong business. It's without a doubt a leader in its respective industries. We have great technology and quite frankly, we have a bit of a tailwind. Fuel economy, emissions, regulations are all very important elements of what drive our business and we have the technology to answer those challenges.</p><p>We are not resting on our laurels. We recognize hereto there's a lot of opportunities that we have internally to run the business better and control our own destiny. But I think you will agree with me when I say that the Vehicle business today is delivering. In fact, when we were here last year, we talked about the business getting to 17% return on sales. As you can see this year, the midpoint of our guidance is already in excess of 17%, so the business is in fact doing exactly what we expect it to do inside of our portfolio as a short cycle business at this point in the cycle.</p><p>So I'm going to stop here and I'm going to turn it over to Uday Yadav, who is going to take you through Aerospace and then I will come back later for the wrapup and the Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p><p>UDAY YADAV, PRESIDENT, AEROSPACE GROUP, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Good morning. There are three main messages I want to share with you today about our Aerospace business. First, we are a strong dynamic enterprise within a growth industry, an industry whose actual advanced technology needs are right in our sweet spot of improving fuel efficiency and power consumption.</p><p>Second, there is a convergence of powerful forces. We are winning increased content on next-generation platforms. We are profiting from the rate increases on legacy platforms and we are gaining in the aftermarket. And these forces have combined to create a robust organic growth engine for the future.</p><p>And third, we are constantly focused on running the business better and we leverage the Eaton Business System to improve productivity and drive margin expansion. So the Aerospace business in 2014 closed with all-time high revenues of $1.9 billion. And just to give you some context, that's about 26% higher than the 2010 recession low. Our business mix is commercial 65% and military 35% with OE and aftermarket being very similar. But as you can see, the single largest segment is commercial OEM, three-quarters of which is large jet transport, which is very much representative of the broader market.</p><p>And aerospace is a very attractive market on a number of dimensions. It provides steady and exciting future growth I'm actually going to expand upon later. It's a long cycle industry where you make major upfront investments that generate really rewarding revenue streams for 25 to 40 years, including a profitable aftermarket. And we have a great technology position that because of large customer investment and certification requirements often leads to sole sourcing. And when you are an incumbent on an existing platform and you are performing, customers really value that pedigree for the future.</p><p>So in 2015, we will be operating in an $11 billion global market and we expect the weighted average of those markets to increase with strong growth in commercial OEM driven by new large transport new launches and rate increases with commercial aftermarket also being up. This is offset though by declines in military due to lower defense spending. Now our own organic growth in 2015 will be in the 2% to 4% range.</p><p>If I can pivot for a minute though and look out five years and frankly beyond, Aerospace really does provide very steady growth. In the next 15 years, air traffic is going to double due to the expanding global middle class. So for example, in China, the number of trips per capita per year is 0.3. That is going to triple in the coming years. So this factor and many other factors are going to lead to the introduction of thousands of new aircraft in the coming years. Our own growth over the next four to five years is going to be a very healthy 6% compound annual growth rate.</p><p>Now our customers are also demanding new forms of technology adoption. They are favoring incremental innovation on existing platforms versus brand-new designs. So what does this do? It shortens the product lifecycle and it creates growth opportunities for companies like ours. So we are in the right markets at the right time with the right portfolio. And as you can see, we participate in four systems on the aircraft and all of these systems are focused on addressing two very critical customer needs -- conserving fuel when you don't need it and using the right amount of power when you do.</p><p>So hydraulic systems on the top left, our industry-leading products generate and distribute power to enable really critical functions on the aircraft, so the lowering and the retraction of landing gear, the movement of wings and the tail to allow the plane to move, the delivery of emergency power when engine power is not available. On the top right, motion control systems. We deliver the steering that allows the plane to taxi on the runway or to stabilize the wings when they are in flight or slow the plane as it approaches landing.</p><p>Fuel management systems, so a typical large commercial jet will carry 30,000 gallons of fuel. We design systems that manage the flow of that fuel to the engine and around the aircraft ensuring at all times there is balance, it is done efficiently and of course safely. And then finally on the bottom right, engine solutions, which is where a lot of innovation is taking place on the engine. We support the engine through our main fuel engine pump. We protect the engine with our oil debris monitoring systems and we connect the engine with other systems on the aircraft through our engine buildup unit. And it is this very strong portfolio that has allowed us to win and grow on the next generation of platforms across almost every single market segment.</p><p>And as you can see on this chart, this ranges from anything from 2 times up to 8 times the content versus previous platforms. For the six examples shown here, they represent about $6.5 billion life-of-program revenue. Three of these planes are actually flying today. Two have entered service and two are getting ready for first flight. The first two examples, military rotocraft, the C853K is a next-generation heavy lift helicopter from the Marines. We are providing the complete hydraulic system, the complete fuel system and the chip detection system for 7 times the content of the previous platform.</p><p>In commercial transport, the recently introduced fuel-efficient long-range 787 that you are all probably familiar with, we've increased our content by a factor of 4 due to our fuel systems and engine solutions. So all of these wins are at different points of development where they clearly translate into real revenue gains for the future. In fact, if you look at the nine new OE wins on this chart that are evenly balanced by the way between commercial and military, and as you can see are at different points in the product lifecycle, they all combine over the next four years to deliver $170 million of incremental sales by 2018. The A350 and the F35 will deliver 70% of that revenue. Both are flying today and annual volumes are expected to triple in 2018 versus the 2015 base.</p><p>Now a large portion of our revenue is derived from our position on legacy platforms. These legacy platforms are very high volume. And because of the growth I described earlier, we expect to have a net gain due to the production rate increases and us winning additional content. More specifically, more specifically, the growth is actually fueled by the large commercial single aisle and these are planes you will typically fly on from coast to coast domestically. And we have one due to additional content. In fact, we have won 20% and 10% more additional content on the 737 Max and the A320 Neo and then we also benefit from the 787 rate increases. These will be offset by OE military declines. All in all though, our legacy OE will grow at about 3.5% compound annual growth rate and deliver $115 million of incremental sales in 2018.</p><p>Aftermarket, aftermarket represents -- we'll be very aggressive in the aftermarket. We expect to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate, almost twice the market. And this is from the actions that we have been taking, very aggressive actions in the commercial and military segments of the aftermarket. These actions include improving our operational performance by reducing repair turnaround times, focusing and reinforcing our dedicated aftermarket organization, of course, capturing our entitlement and then driving modern upgrades on our products. And we believe these combined actions will come together to deliver $120 million of outgrowth by 2018.</p><p>So big pictures on outgrowth, we expect to deliver slightly north of $400 million of incremental revenue growing at 6% compounded annual growth rate by 2018 with 60% of that growth coming from the OEM side of our business and 40% coming from the aftermarket.</p><p>Turning to technology, if I may and why we are winning. Just in the last two years, we have generated $3 billion life-of-program wins across our entire product portfolio and with balanced wins across multiple market segments. So we will be delivering unprecedented levels of high pressure fuel flow from our fuel engine pumps to the engine to help improve engine efficiency. We are optimizing the weight on the engine buildup units that connect the engine with other systems on the aircraft. We are bringing a higher reliability hydraulic equipment to the next reengine regional jets and we are supporting and providing increased refueling flow for the next generation military tanker. And then a few months ago, we won the fuel and inerting on the regional turboprop.</p><p>Turning to a quick case study, if I may, and why our technology is allowing us to win in the $5 billion commercial OE market. On the right-hand side, you see an example of how a seemingly simple component -- sorry -- how innovation apply to a seemingly simple component can dramatically improve uptime by a factor of 4 on emission-critical jet engine. So sitting there for a minute, if you can imagine a large jet engine with a main shaft running through and connecting the five main modules of the engine that generate power for the aircraft, each of which has bearings that allow the shaft to rotate.</p><p>Now traditionally the bearings on the shaft in the module have seals that contain fluid where they physically touch each other. This causes wear, friction, wear and eventual replacement after 10,000 hours. Now our hydrodynamically designed seals uniquely create an air barrier between these two seals, eliminating physical contact and therefore increasing life. And as you can imagine, that creates tremendous value for our customers. They have greater uptime, lower maintenance costs and obviously we can command a premium for that product.</p><p>Moving to the military market where our innovative technology has allowed us to win on the next-generation tanker and the next-generation transportation claims. So if you can imagine for a minute the KC-46A, which is the US Air Force's next-generation tanker, flying at altitudes up to 40,000 feet at speeds of up to 500 miles an hour, simultaneously by the way refueling another plane, doing it very, very quickly and of course safely in a highly variable environment up there, that's where our technology comes in.</p><p>And just to give you some context of what that means, in a typical jet engine, fuel flows to the engine at about 25 gallons per minute. When you are refueling in the air, that increases by a factor of 50 to 1200 gallons per minute. Big numbers. And that is where our technology really comes in. So our uniquely designed, high-capacity pump and redesigned boom refueling nozzles are going to improve the fuel flow on this platform by 10% to 30% versus the prior platform and improve life of the pump by about 30%. And as you can imagine for our customers, end customers, that creates tremendous value. And so here are a couple of examples around our technology, where we have won in the past, where we are investing today and why we will continue to drive to win in the future around this technology investment.</p><p>Craig talked a little bit earlier around how each of the groups is focused on running the business better by leveraging the Eaton Business System. Within the Aerospace group, we have aggressive plans to improve our overall cost structure through optimizing our manufacturing footprint and transitioning product to best cost countries. In this example from Tijuana, Mexico, which is one of our model plants, over the next five years, we will be doubling our sales or doubling our output from this plant and obviously expanding the factory, helping to improve our overall cost structure and obviously asset utilization.</p><p>Another example, this time from Batam, Indonesia, which is one of the world-class manufacturing sites of the 14 that Craig referenced earlier in his presentation, here we are deploying, as Craig described earlier, the continuous improvement framework across all of our factories, including this one in Batam. Then our local team took four very complex productlines, did a lot of work to simplify those lines into one continuous flow for mixed model assembly that resulted in the results that you see, improvements in manufacturing leadtime, improvement in inventory days and most importantly, improvements in productivity.</p><p>So why am I sharing this one example with you? It's because, as Craig shared earlier, we are doing and driving this every day in every factory across all of the Aerospace plants and over time this is going to result in us increasing our margins and we see a direct link between improving our manufacturing performance, improving our productivity and expanding our margin. A lot of work to do in the aerospace industry and specifically in our business.</p><p>So we believe the Aerospace business is positioned very well for profitable growth. We are clearly in the right market and a very exciting time of growth for our industry. We have a strong presence on platforms, on many platforms, platforms that will definitely be growing in the future. We have invested for outgrowth and I think you have seen evidence of that in our new OEM wins and our gains in the aftermarket. And we are absolutely relentlessly focused on execution, on running our business better by leveraging the Eaton Business System.</p><p>So in 2015, we expect our operating margins to be in the 15.1% to 15.7% range, a rise of 40 to 100 basis points from our 2014 performance. With that, I'd like to thank you and hand back to Craig to help summarize for the sector.</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Thanks, Uday. I would hope that you got a sense from Uday and my presentation that, yes, Eaton is a power management company and our industrial businesses are players in power management. But more importantly than that, we do tough things. We do things that are difficult to do. We do things that have to be safe and we do things that have to be reliable and that is really where our technology comes to bear and what makes our Company so special.</p><p>Now as we talk about the markets that we served, individually we will in fact see cycles. We talk about being in the right markets and when you think about it in the context of our Company and creating balance through the economic cycle, each of our businesses plays a vital role in terms of building that balance. And so we are in fact in the right markets and at different points in the cycle. Each of these businesses will perform and be the engine of earnings and revenue growth for the Company. And most importantly, especially at this point in time, we are leveraging the Eaton Business System. We are finding ways to control our own destiny, to run the Company better, to be more effective in getting more out of what we have today both internally and in the form of the relationships that we have with our customers. So I'm going to stop here and I'm going to turn it over to Q&amp;A and Uday and I would be pleased to address any questions that you may have.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just a question on -- I think it is slide 12. You called out the potential for Hydraulics to see 17% at the next peak. I'm just wondering if you could help us define what you are including in that peak. Does it mean a return of unit volume to the prior peak or is there some outgrowth to get back to what you think is peak?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: The first thing I would say, Andy, it's a great question. If you think about the things that we have done, number one, to reposition the Hydraulics business today, we talk about it being a 13% to 14%, 15%, 16%, 17% plus, I would say even today it's a business that is performing at higher margins at every point in the cycle and that is fundamentally a result of the things that we have done historically to improve the cost base, to improve our business mix and to reposition the franchise.</p><p>And so at every point in the cycle, if you compare the business today to the business that existed five years ago, it's a more profitable business. So fundamentally what we are counting on is that essentially delivering what we do today and what we have done is simply putting the volume on top. That is simply delivering the incremental revenue and the incremental margins that would normally accrue on top of the restructuring actions that we have taken. So it doesn't require a bunch of new wins. It's simply incremental margins on market change and the restructuring actions that we have taken.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: There's a number of different end markets and again, as I mentioned in that one chart, I showed three examples, one of which was China construction and we don't believe that China construction ever gets back to peak. We don't think it was real. We don't think it was sustainable at those levels and so certainly we think global ag comes back. We certainly think mining comes back, oil and gas comes back and China construction is better than it is today, but it never gets back to peak. We're not expecting that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can we talk a little bit about the restructuring program in Hydraulics you are doing? How much are you going to spend and philosophically, what are you trying to accomplish? The 30%, which is where most of it is going to be, we already know that mining had a completely new norm, far lower volume levels before. You just indicated you expect that in China construction. Is that the bulk of it, or are you making any plans for whether the structural recalibration in the ag market or the oil and gas market that you have to address the new capacity?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Yes, what we're really doing, Eli, is we are really structurally changing the business in its totality. We serve these markets as one Hydraulics business. We don't differentiate the organization by the different end markets that we serve. So essentially we have taken steps today around our manufacturing footprint, around our support costs to essentially take our cost base down and that will deliver a benefit to the overall business and certainly those benefits accrue everyplace. So it's not specific to any particular market.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Yes, what we have said is that it is similar to what we as a sector -- we are taking restructuring charges in 2015 that is similar to what we took in 2014.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: $35 million?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: It is similar.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Craig, sorry, it's Hydraulics again. My concern is that your minus 2% to 0% is still too aggressive. Can you talk a little bit about 50% of your business is distribution and so almost by definition you don't know what end markets your product are going to through distribution. So how comfortable are you that this is your total end market mix and that you are not overleveraged to oil and gas through distribution, or that there is something else going out there on the distribution side that you are not prepared for?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Appreciate the question in terms of -- a big piece of our business does go through distribution. We actually do know, by the way, for most of the business that we sell into distribution where it goes by the virtue of the relationships and the arrangements we have with distribution. We typically get point-of-purchase data, so we can go through distribution and with a pretty good approximation determine which end markets they are serving, determine which of their business is OEM business, which of their business is aftermarket and if you recall from the time you spent at Eaton Prairie this year, we went through a little bit of that. So we do in fact have a very good sense for where business goes that goes through distribution. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, our distribution orders were still up quite nicely.</p><p>At this point, it is our best thinking, Ann. We could fine-tune that at some point during the course of the year, but so far we've not seen anything yet that would suggest that a year of 0% to down 2% isn't a good approximation for where we think the business will end.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: On Hydraulics, about nine months ago, I think you had an analyst day where you laid out how attractive the market was in terms of organic and inorganic capital deployment. Listening to the material this morning, it sounds like the other businesses within Industrial, Aerospace and Vehicle have a higher growth rate and they are less volatile over the cycle. So I just wondered, how is your view on capital deployment in Hydraulics changed, if at all, and is there an appetite to kind of grow share in Hydraulics now if you think that you're just in the short-term cyclical trough?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: I think it really is the latter. One of the things that we believe strongly that -- we play to win in every one of our businesses. As a company, we are not really capital-constrained. We have an opportunity to make the investments that we think are good investments and we make them everyplace. And so we are certainly still playing to win in Hydraulics and everything that you heard in that Analyst Day still applies. What I was trying to do in today's presentation was to give you a sense for specifically what are we doing in the near term to deal with this issue of volatility and the fact that every one of us are reading the same headlines around what is going on in a lot of our big Hydraulics markets, which are clearly quite awful right now. But no, we still are making the investments around programs and initiatives to win in that space as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just a question -- I know you are time-constraint today, but over the past several years, superchargers featured very prominently in every one of your presentations. And I'm just surprised that you chose not to include it. Could you comment on that?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: No, I think you hit the nail on the head. It is time-constraint. If you take a look at what is going internally in our business today, I just had an opportunity to review superchargers with Sandy and the Board. Our revenues in 2015 will grow by 20%, so we are still doing very well in supercharger and it is still certainly an important piece of our strategy around how we grow our automotive business and this whole issue around engine downsiding, downspeeding, improving efficiency, superchargers continues to play very prominently in our strategy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And if I may ask a follow-up question on Aerospace. We met with one of your competitors and they sort of highlighted the breadth of their product and the fact that they built up a very strong platform. And I guess I'm very pleased to see your ability to take marketshare because they built a very good case why you are not in a good position. But the question I have, what is the cost of taking this marketshare in terms of R&amp;D, in terms of pricing. What's the long-term prospect for Aerospace margin given the fact that you are taking marketshare very aggressively?</p><p>UDAY YADAV: So obviously I appreciate the feedback and comments about the other aspect of your news, but, from our perspective, certainly we have a number of active programs that are still underway where we are investing. So large R&amp;D investment. I don't see that R&amp;D investment coming down in the foreseeable feature in the short to medium term and that is because, as you launch these new technologies, you are still learning, you are still applying understanding. You still need capability to do that.</p><p>And then secondly, it is likely that we will shift some of those resources into growing the aftermarket. But certainly there's opportunity for further margin expansion from our productivity improvements that we are doing in our factories and also obviously from the aftermarket growth that is going to ensue.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Craig, on Aerospace, 8% of the overall Company, and I'm not going to debate, as we talked about before, the attractiveness of the industry and the attractiveness of your individual franchises in the industry, but the question for me remains over long term I hear from many of your competitors in the industry their desire for some of your assets. You're in an upturn and just trying to understand what is the long-term role in the portfolio and is this a not just organic growth platform, but what do you do with this over time? Are you at a long-term competitive disadvantage relative to the scope and scale of everybody else in this industry and it's just a niche position at this point?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Great question. I would say, as we have said and we look at opportunities to grow the Company in terms of where our priorities are with respect to M&amp;A, Aerospace continues to be one of the priorities. In the context of the existing business and how well we are positioned and whether or not it becomes a marginalized position based upon others in the industry, I would say today we have a very strong position in hydraulic systems, a very strong position in fuel systems and in many ways a very defensible position. And as you certainly appreciate, it's a very long cycle industry so things just don't change in the near term. And so those businesses today are very well-positioned. We made the decision, as you know, last year to divest a couple of small assets in Aerospace where we didn't have strategic advantage. We thought those assets would be more valuable to somebody else and we did so and we are prepared to do that with our Company and every business goes through a process where we take a look at it. We are very much convinced that we have a very strong position in hydraulic systems and fuel systems and fluid conveyance systems and we have opportunities to continue to do internal development programs, as well as M&amp;A opportunities to grow that piece of the franchise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm trying to rationalize -- perhaps you can help me with this -- there's an inconsistency between having -- and I commend you for having in-factory metrics that are consistent -- quality, safety, delivery, etc. Those are outward-looking. They look to the employee and they look to the customer. But every time corporate talks about your metrics, they are increasing productivity or lowering costs and those are inward-facing metrics. They are not things that frankly the employee or the customer cares about. Does that present a dichotomy if you have differing metrics in how you judge how well you are doing?</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: No, I would tell you that -- it's a great question -- it's one I spend a fair amount of time talking to our factory teams about. I don't think it's an inconsistent metric. When I am sitting in front of our plant employees, I'm talking to them about the things that they can do to help grow the Company. And what they can do to help grow the Company is they can deliver outstanding quality. They can deliver on time every time 100% of the time. They can make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace by producing more efficiently, more effectively every day. So I don't think it's in any way inconsistent in terms of what our manufacturing plants are doing to enable --.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was really going the other way. The corporate goals speak to reducing costs and increasing productivity. Are those not inconsistent with those?</p><p>UDAY YADAV: Maybe I can help a little bit. Actually, within the factory metric, there is a productivity metric as well and that directly links with ultimately what the Corporation goals are around improving margin. So reducing leadtime, reducing inventory, improving productivity, getting more out with less people through applying lean techniques that is directly linked with our corporate goals.</p><p>CRAIG ARNOLD: Maybe I can take it offline. Okay, we can do it offline. All right. Thank you. So we will go to break.</p><p>TOM GROSS, VICE CHAIRMAN &amp; COO, ELECTRICAL SECTOR, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Okay, well, please grab a seat. Good morning. It's my pleasure to take you through the next -- kick off actually four presentations that will take you through an update on the Electrical Sector.</p><p>Let me just start by saying the obvious: we're in a terrific business because of what's written on the upper left of this slide, these megatrends, and I suspect they are playing out across the electrical industry. I can say for certain they are playing out in an accelerated fashion in the markets that we serve, on the bottom right of this.</p><p>We are in a really good position to provide answers to those four megatrends. We've used to this chart before to summarize our capabilities into seven core competencies. And the secret to understanding the power of that portfolio is the fact that each one of the target segments on the bottom, typically one of those seven is a lot more important than the other six; and yet every one of them buys at least four or five of the seven; and some of those segments buy all seven.</p><p>So that's really a secret to understanding the portfolio and, frankly, the secret to understanding the basic nature of the sales synergies that we talk so much about with Cooper, because three of the seven came to us to via the Cooper acquisition; four were traditional Eaton. You can see that in a little more detail here: as I said, at least four, but typically five or more are required. These technology platforms really are important to each and every one of our segments.</p><p>One of the important aspects of this chart, however, is the fact that it's not just about having stuff, whether it's from us directly or through our channel; it's really about application and industry relevance. So one of the big things we took on and accomplished -- globally, by the way -- through 2013 and 2014, is we changed, frankly, a large number of independent salesforces that were chartered to sell horizontally. In other words, they were behind one of these technologies; so they were the power distribution salesforce, or the power quality salesforce, or the fusing and disconnect salesforce. We took all of those and we flipped them vertically.</p><p>That was a big change, and what we were trying to accomplish, obviously, was to unlock application and industry relevance. Because you cannot possibly be an industry expert across five or six segments and hundreds of thousands of products.</p><p>So we made it simple for them. They are jerseyed on one of these and they're now in a position to know what to lead with and then how to pull through the other four, five, or six technologies that would go too.</p><p>So we're very excited about that change. We think that's a five or more year transition. It's paying off already, but it's going to have legs to really fuel unleashing the power of that portfolio.</p><p>We have a very good scale today both geographically. You can see we're approaching 50-50 US and non-US revenues.</p><p>Probably more important, look at the industry segment diversity that we have today. For those of you who have followed us a long time you know that you don't have to go back very far to remember that the left side of this was mostly orange and the right side of this was mostly blue. In fact the right side of this, there wasn't even a green not that long ago; and the red, the utility, was so small you could barely read it.</p><p>So we've diversified our end market mix. That's led to better balance; it's led to better solution content and, again, just greater relevance to those segments and the applications within them.</p><p>So we are quite happy with that. A ways to go yet, obviously, geographically, because the market is really a third, a third, a third when you think about Europe, APAC, and Americas. So we have some more work to do, but we are pleased with the progress.</p><p>Let's jump into the two reporting segments, products first. This is a very attractive $7.3 billion segment, we think today with the scale to compete globally.</p><p>On the left, in case you're not familiar with what all rolls up into this segment, you can see the big capabilities. These are actually big business units within Electrical Sector that roll up into the Products reporting segment.</p><p>Our growth drivers are many. I've captured a few here, but the big ones for us are the conversion to LED technology and what used to be called the Cooper lighting business.</p><p>And you'll see later today that's just the start of it. There's an awful lot more technology and a technology play that's going to go into lighting and lighting control that we think we're advantaged towards. That's driving a lot of growth.</p><p>Our new relevance in distribution channels is really terrific. We're going to go into some detail.</p><p>We're going to show you the North American example of that here in a few minutes. It's just an example of greater distribution relevance around the world.</p><p>And if, let's say in the past, we might have been number six at a distributor, and Cooper might have been six or seven, or five or six, together we're typically now number three or four at the distributors. And that's interesting because wiring is always number one, right, and we sell a lot of wire.</p><p>So we're typically number one, two, or three in terms of our revenues as a percentage of the channel. So we're a lot more relevant; that's driving some very interesting growth for us.</p><p>I'd also want to highlight the smaller end of our power quality market. We have today arguably the best single-phase product lineup in the world, and we are driving market share gains year in and year out. That's been a good source of growth for us and, of course, just leveraging our total portfolio, as I mentioned.</p><p>So as you can see in 2014, a very handsome business at 17.2%. We think 2015 that expands to somewhere in the mid-17%s to low 18%s.</p><p>A quick look at Systems and Service, a $6.5 billion segment for us in 2014. High-value systems and services across all aspects of the value chain. Big capabilities; on the left here you can see is where we put all of our services as well.</p><p>Growth drivers for us. We're, without question, the leader in safety in terms of electrical systems.</p><p>Arc flash is an Eaton heritage; and explosionproof is definitely a Cooper heritage. We put that together and we market ourselves now as the provider of the safest electrical solutions. And that applies to all of our segments because arcs and explosions obviously are catastrophic events, and we're in a position to eliminate them.</p><p>Our energy-efficient UPS strategy and our products continue to resonate with data center owners and operators everywhere. It's a great example of when we win there we pull through just a juggernaut of other equipment.</p><p>IEC assemblies. Sandy had mentioned we are in the fifth year of deployment of capabilities that we just have very terrific share and capabilities in, in North America. We've wrapped to that into assemblies and systems that meet global standards, and we're in the fifth year of executing a growth strategy in those IEC markets.</p><p>Then finally a way to think about growth and margin in Systems and Services is you have to have the capabilities, and you have to have the ability to engineer to order and the manufacturing facilities that can build flexible systems. But to a large degree, growth and margin is driven by your ability to manage projects on behalf of your customers and hook services, value-add services, during the project. And we think we're very good at that.</p><p>Margins in Systems and Services, 13.8% in 2014. We believe that expands to mid-14%s to low 15% in 2015.</p><p>Sandy mentioned we are on track to deliver the Cooper integration savings, a $150 million step-up in 2015. The integration finishes in 2015, and that allows us to essentially capture the full-year effect of all of the projects in 2016. And that adds another incremental $115 million of profit.</p><p>I thought I'd go back to the format we've used a couple times now. I hope you're not getting tired of it, but it's a good way to give you an update.</p><p>We are meeting our upwardly revised sales synergy targets. We have always broken these into these four buckets.</p><p>And let me start with the second because that's -- larger package to common customers is basically what I just talked about, where we have the seven key capabilities. Figure out what's important and then sell the rest, so don't stop after we get one of the seven. And then a channel program that aligns with that and takes -- allows us to capture the increased relevance and allow distributors to opt into a bigger Eaton package to go along with that.</p><p>When we look at 2016, by the way, we think about 75% of the sales synergies will come from the first two. The other two are very important, though.</p><p>We had identified that former Cooper did not have a service business, yet they have a lot of business units that services are required. So we wanted to provide those services on top of their solutions.</p><p>Then the fourth one was geographic expansion, not broadly speaking but limited to certain countries where we were both real small fries. We thought if we put them together, we're a little more relevant and we can get higher growth rates.</p><p>We view those two as about 25% of the total. Now that's probably a little more lopsided than we've explained it in the past, and a way to think about it is that the first two tend to happen quicker, and the last two tend to take a little more time. Because it's hard to build a service business that's profitable, and it's a little bit harder to be in countries where your brands aren't recognized.</p><p>So this is a 2016 view. We think over time that we probably go back to the balance that we explained before, which was closer to 65/35. So we think the right will -- all four will continue to play out after the acquisition, with a little bit more emphasis on the right.</p><p>We are also meeting our revised cost targets. We had identified these five areas, and you can see our view of where we are as of January 1 of this year in terms of complete.</p><p>Let me start on the right. 100% done with all the corporate integration tasks. The second one was really the SG&amp;A part of the savings, where we have integrated certain similar groups and taken advantage of Eaton's investments in shared service centers.</p><p>We're about 90% complete there, with some follow-on project still remaining in Europe. Just takes a little longer, given the works councils, to get through some of that. But largely complete there.</p><p>Supply chain, a big source of P&amp;L benefit. We're about 70% complete. We're higher than that if you look at the original list of projects we had; but as we have gone through this integration we keep finding new projects, so we've got about 30% more economic value to capture there.</p><p>EBS: a good story. The Cooper facilities fully absorbing Eaton Lean system, Eaton quality system, production planning, processes, and the like. I would say with pretty high degree of confidence if you walked into a former Cooper plant or an Eaton plant, you couldn't tell the difference today. But there's still probably 30% economic value to capture up against the goal we had set.</p><p>Finally, plant and distribution center, about 60% done with the projects.</p><p>So just as a summary and then I'll let the next three presenters come up, we really think we're in a great position for our current reality in 2015 and beyond. Just a terrific portfolio of brands. We use the term anchor brands; these mean a lot to our customer and our channel: Crouse-Hinds, Cutler-Hammer, Moeller, Phoenixtec, and so on.</p><p>Growing strength in the channel; an array of customer and application experts and increased relevance due to the unlocking of that salesforce; leading positions in some key markets such as data centers, lighting, and key industrials. Just a terrific broad basket of solutions, and an ability to continue to innovate.</p><p>The next three presenters are going to cover these highlights in blue. Sandy had showed you the agenda, so I'm going to pass the podium over to Revathi Advaithi, our regional President of Americas, who's going to give you a good summary of the channel. And by the way, all four of us will be up here at the end to answer any of your questions, okay? Thanks.</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI, PRESIDENT, AMERICAS REGION, ELECTRICAL, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Thank you. Good morning. My role here today is to connect the dots with what Tom had talked about, which is a significant portion of the Cooper sales synergy came from channel and the package to common customers, and how did we get that sales synergy, and how are we positioned in the future with that sales synergy.</p><p>Now, most of you know the story well. The electrical value chain is a complex one. Everybody who buys power is our customer, and we get to touch all of them in some shape or form, so we have to be well positioned to take this from an individual consumer who's in a residence all the way to a large industrial customer of some kind.</p><p>And we do this extremely well. Our salesforce, which I will talk about later, is really positioned very well to do this.</p><p>A good example would be to talk about this with a project that we recently won, and this is here in your neck of the woods, in the Tappan Zee project that was announced, the reconstruction of that project here across the Hudson. In a project like that, typically you would start a project like that with a consulting engineer of some kind, a company that is basically designing how the rebuild is going to happen.</p><p>Our Eaton application engineer would work with the consulting engineer to help design that project and bring in the utility expertise and the local expertise that the application engineer has. So that puts Eaton in a really good specification advantage when you start a project like that.</p><p>And then as you move through the phases, you get to the general contractor phase, where there will be a general contractor. The Eaton sales engineer at that point in time will be working with the general contractor to make sure that plant schedules are lined up; that any changes in the design are going through the plant, and that is well positioned.</p><p>Then it goes to an electrical contractor, where our distributor sales specialist will work with a local distributor to take that project and make sure inventory is positioned, project management is well positioned. And then on the completion of the project, then we'll go to the end-user and our service team will work with the owner/operator to make sure there's lifecycle support through that whole project.</p><p>So a typical project -- you can do this in a grand scale or you can do this for a $50,000 project -- but it has at least four to five touch points across this project. What Eaton does extremely well is position ourselves across all these touch points.</p><p>So we are very good at creating pull with our customers. We know how to do that extremely well. What this helps do for our partners and our distributors is then they push our product and position our product in the marketplace.</p><p>Most of my talk today is about distributors and how Eaton positions ourselves with distributors. You know this well. You know distributors are important because the Electrical franchise, our go-to-market model is complex, thousands of customers, distributors. Varied geographic footprint is important in this case.</p><p>Dealing with many transactions is really important in this. 70% of Eaton's Electrical revenue goes through our distributor partner network. It's really, really important for us to do this well. Then you combine that with local inventory, good project management support, it really makes for a strong story.</p><p>The distribution segment here in North America is very fragmented. Many, many thousands of distributors here in this part of the world, tens of thousands of branches.</p><p>A good way to think about this group of our customers is they fall into three major categories. I think about them as the big nationals; you know who are they are. They are fairly well known.</p><p>They have hundreds of employees, many branches. Typically they'll go across probably four or five segments across that footprint.</p><p>Then you have the super-regionals, who are really very important in this mix, too, who will be across multi-states. In a case like here in the Northeast, they may be a New England, they may be in New York, they may be in New Jersey. Maybe going into Washington, DC; that would be a super-regional.</p><p>Smaller number of branches, less employees. Could be in one or two segments, sometime could go to more than that.</p><p>And then we have many, many local distributors who could be in small towns across the United States. All they are serving is that particular city or county in one or two segments.</p><p>What we have to get right is how do you weave this network of not only the right distributor at the right point but in the right segment. Because you have to do that well, too.</p><p>In a project like the Tappan Zee project I talked about, we would be partnering with a certain distributor in a project like that. But if you have a residential renovation coming up in this part of the country, there would probably be a different distributor we would be partnering up with.</p><p>So we have to weave that web really correctly. We've been doing that for a while, and with the Cooper integration we really enhanced that. But once you get it right, it creates a sustained growth platform for us across this part of the world.</p><p>We have spent a lot of time with distributor; obviously, 70% of our overall revenue. We know what they want from us, and we are very focused on making sure that we deliver that well.</p><p>Distributors have told us consistently that for us to be valued we have to do well in these six categories; and I'll talk about them in a second. But you combine those six categories and put that together with an incentive program that is really strong, that's a winning proposition that really excites our distributors -- one of the big reasons why the best distributors in the industry today want to partner with Eaton.</p><p>Let me start with the portfolio. What the Cooper acquisition did for us was really enhance our overall portfolio and what goes through an electrical distributor. 65% of what an ED wants Eaton can provide today.</p><p>Just think about that for a second. That's a huge number. What's left of it, we really are not very keen on having.</p><p>But we have the entire portfolio from an electrical standpoint for what a distributor really values and is important to him. That's 65%. But on top of that, in each of these categories that we deliver, we're usually positioned in a number-one or number-two position, so that's extremely important, too.</p><p>Now the benefits to a supplier is of course very obvious, right? If you have more scale with one manufacturer, there's transaction efficiencies; your training gets easier; your marketing programs get easier. So the benefits to the distributor for manufacturers to have a portfolio that works for them is really very, very important.</p><p>The second part is, distributors want manufacturers who can create pull. Right? I talked about that Tappan Zee project, and they look for manufacturers who do this very well.</p><p>Eaton's salesforce, the largest and the best today in the industry, by far, our distributors recognize us for that. They like us for this, and they know our commitment to having the best salesforce in the industry is very, very strong.</p><p>So 1,700 salespeople and 60% of them are specialists in some way or form. I talked about the project that I did, the Tappan Zee project, right? So there will be application engineers; there are distribution sales specialists; there will be a segment specialist who works with infrastructure projects. So really a variety of different specialists who make up this entire 1,700 salespeople.</p><p>It's very important for us to keep that specialist and make sure that that education continues. They drive specification for Eaton today and in the long term.</p><p>You combine a strong portfolio with the best salesforce in the industry, and we have to make sure that you have service when you do projects, or in an aftermarket environment. In the power industry, service is critical.</p><p>If you don't have the best service capability, that is a difficult way to do business. Eaton has built up its service portfolio over a long period of time, and now we're enhancing that with the capability that we get to deliver for all the Cooper projects.</p><p>An example that recently happened here, just for you to envision how the service structure works for us, is a pretty significant hospital chain in Ohio recently had three of their transformers blow up in one of their main research labs. Pretty significant, right, because you have very expensive mice there, and you have all this research capability there, and every minute counts.</p><p>The first place they called was Eaton. And Eaton went in and -- remember, now we have a transformer portfolio with Cooper, so that really also adds to this story in a big way. And a change like this would take weeks to be able to put together. Eaton was able to go in, make sure there was backup power there in a matter of hours, but also bring back the entire facility within a week; and that meant brand-new transformers, brand-new grounding systems, and was able to manufacture, deliver, install in what could've been a 12- to 18-week project.</p><p>That's why customers rely on Eaton. They know if they have a mission-critical situation, Eaton will be there.</p><p>Our distributors love that about us. They know that you can count on us when we are called.</p><p>So, portfolio, large salesforce, strong service. You have to have innovation. Frank Campbell is going to come after me and talk about innovation and why Eaton is known as an innovation leader, so that's expected of us and we have that.</p><p>You combine these with our brand portfolio. We have strong anchor brands which only got enhanced with the Cooper acquisition.</p><p>This is really important to the distributors, because this opens doors for them and then it keeps it open. They know that they don't have to go sell a Crouse-Hinds story; or they don't have to talk about the Bussmann product, because it's known.</p><p>Our distributors consistently tell us that having such strong anchor brands really provides operating margin advantages for their franchise. So we're really proud of this portfolio of brands that we have.</p><p>You combine all that with ease of doing business. Tom talked about -- Sandy talked about that. Important for transaction efficiency.</p><p>I'll give you a small example here. We do hundreds and thousands of projects every day. You think, well, that sounds like a big number. Well, a $5,000 project is also a project.</p><p>So it could be that there is a small retail shop that is getting set up in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Our distributor would go in there, sit with a customer; in a few minutes configure a project there on the Eaton configurator. That project would get sent to our plants, and we start the production process.</p><p>So a $5000 project or millions of dollars of project, and our configurator systems goes through that entire value chain with the distributor and they use it very, very effectively. We are only working to enhance this. We have a strong position today, but this is also very important to all our distributors.</p><p>Okay, so distributors tell you you have to be best-in-class in the six areas I talked about. But you have to provide great incentives. We all know that, right? Makes people happy when you have good incentives.</p><p>We were able to, post-Cooper acquisition, look at the Cooper program, the Eaton program, what really works well, and put that together to come up with a best-in-class program. We call that the Eaton Distributor Advantage program.</p><p>What this program does is it incentivizes distributors on growth -- very, very important. It incentivizes distributors on loyalty -- loyalty to our products. We provide them business development funds for them to be really focused on the areas we want to grow together on; and then, of course, we incentivize them to do business easier and on e-tools.</p><p>So we combine this really strong financial reward package, we launched a combined channel organization across our teams, and then a very in-depth goalsetting marketing program process that has taken us to the next level of performance. All this put together really has helped us deliver the strong synergy number that we talked about earlier.</p><p>I don't have to say much. You just have to read the quote to know what one of our top super-regional distributors thinks about Eaton. You bring together the best-in-class in these six areas, combined with a strong incentive program, deliver strong goalsetting and marketing programs together with a distributor, it creates a winning proposition for them and for us.</p><p>I'm going to talk about a few examples here. It brings it home. It's always good to have examples to envision how all this comes together, and I have some really fun ones.</p><p>This one is for our Bussmann fuse brand. All of you know Bussmann fuses; well-known for reliability, innovation, product portfolio.</p><p>A big national distributor looked across their national footprint and had a variety of different fuse brands, came to Eaton and said: Hey, I would like to look at not only inventory rationalization but it will provide better training for our teams. And then of course what also that gives them is the power of scale that our portfolio provides today, which provides better incentives for them, and asked to convert to a complete Bussmann inventory across their footprint.</p><p>So that was one example of a conversion. You see everything working from our anchor brand strategy, our innovative products, and then loyalty to Eaton as a whole.</p><p>The second example is in our lighting segment. As most of you know, distributors tend to carry maybe a few lighting lines, and they will do that just to make sure that they have something for everyone. We have such a wide portfolio today that there really isn't a significant need to do that.</p><p>So a small local independent distributor came to us and looked at our lighting platform. He had a variety of different lighting people that he was buying from, and knew that going to Eaton really helped scale his overall capability with Eaton, and wanted to make Eaton lighting products their primary supplier, and elected to do that. Again, very successful conversion for us and for them.</p><p>The third one is an example around our switchgear. Switchgear is our major franchise for the legacy Eaton portfolio. This is one of my favorite example, a very significant super regional distributor who was mainly Cooper, really had no Eaton platforms at all. Post-Cooper looked at the overall Eaton distribution equipment capability, which they knew about, but were partnered with some of our competitors and said: Hey, we'd like to really look at partnering with Eaton.</p><p>This gives them a more connected portfolio. This gives them the ability to really have Eaton's mindshare, what they did already but creates significantly more mindshare, and then really takes advantage of this whole loyalty that we talked about in a big way. And they went to this one brand in each of their locations and saw our full Eaton Cooper portfolio across their footprint.</p><p>Then the last example here is -- one of our many segment strategies is around light commercial construction. These are small projects that are less than 50,000 square feet. Typically distributors have carried Eaton for the larger projects and have not really taken Eaton for the off-the-shelf type small projects.</p><p>We have done a lot to change our portfolio so it makes it easier for them to carry our product in the smaller project space. We have enhanced processes in terms of how we do business with them. I talked about the configurator and things like that.</p><p>So a large regional distributor decided to go with Eaton across their footprint with the large projects and the off-the-shelf projects. So you see how this works, right? There is really strong power of loyalty; it drives growth for both of us; and it makes them a very scalable supplier for them and for us.</p><p>It's really strong story in terms of these examples. You see how all this comes together.</p><p>I want to close with this, is that I told you in the beginning the distribution channel was important. When a 70% of our revenue goes through this distribution channel, they are really important to us.</p><p>We listen a lot; we take their feedback; and we are driving best-in-class in the six categories that they want us to be really good at. We have combined that with a fantastic incentive program that drives growth for them and for us.</p><p>And together I think with all of this we have created a really sustainable growth platform for Eaton, not just in the synergy time frame but really for years to come. It's a really good story here.</p><p>With that, I'm going to hand it over to Frank Campbell.</p><p>FRANK CAMPBELL, PRESIDENT, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA REGION, ELECTRICAL, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Okay. Thanks, Revathi. Good morning, everybody. You've heard Tom and Sandy both talk about how critical innovation is to the success of our Electrical business, and it really is. So I'm particularly excited this morning to share with you the innovation story in the Electrical Sector.</p><p>What I'd like to share with you is some of the capabilities and assets that we have on the ground, how we use those to actually create innovative solutions. And then I have several examples of how we've used those assets to actually create something innovative for a customer, so I'll share some examples of innovation that we are delivering today that have come from that process.</p><p>I'm particular happy to be able to do it, because it's a subject that I have an intense amount of passion about and I really enjoy. I think a great place to start the discussion is to first think about the incredible opportunity that we have as an innovator in the electrical space.</p><p>I think there's three dimensions we should consider here. First is just the demand, the base demand, the base need around the world for electricity.</p><p>Cities, giant cities are being developed around the world; an incredible there. The digitization of our economy -- obviously, as more digital things are put in place the demand for electricity grows.</p><p>And then the fact of the matter is that there's billions of people on the planet today that don't have power. So it is an incredible opportunity for innovators like Eaton to provide solutions.</p><p>Second dimension I think we should think about is the issues with electricity. There's some of them shown on the board here. It's a complex subject, right?</p><p>It is really, really fraught with issues that customers have to deal with. Clearly as an innovator, those aren't issues to us; those are opportunities.</p><p>And then I think last and most importantly is -- the real force multiplier of the opportunity is the incredible diversity of the applications, the customers, and the segments that we serve. Because each of those customers has each of those problems; but each of those customers views each of those problems differently.</p><p>One is more important than the next. So matching up a customer to a problem is sort of an infinite set of combinations that you get there, and you have an incredible opportunity to innovate. So clearly a target-rich environment.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, though, that as significant as the opportunity is, as significant as the number of things we have to work on, innovation doesn't just happen. It's not an automatic thing. It is a purposeful and intentional activity.</p><p>I think you need -- we think we need and we think we have some distinctive capabilities in really three areas. First one is customer engagement. Obviously, innovation starts with a customer.</p><p>Being able to understand what keeps customers awake at night, critically important. So you need to have a very capable engagement mechanism, and we believe we do in the Electrical Sector.</p><p>Clearly electricity is technical. Most of the solutions we offer are technologically based; and therefore you need to have some smart people, and those people need to have the assets and tools required to do their job.</p><p>And last but not least, clearly with all the things that are going on, you need a process in place to govern the innovation that we are working on.</p><p>So let me start with probably the single most important aspect of our ability to innovate, and that's understanding what our customers' problems really are. You heard Revathi talk about this; you heard Tom talk about this, as well as vertical market segments.</p><p>We are increasingly aligning our resources in the organization around vertical markets. We're increasingly specializing, putting people in place that have either come from or have worked very closely with these industries for a long period of time.</p><p>They are thought leaders in the industry and they position Eaton as thought leaders in the industry. We have people that really, truly understand what keeps these customers awake at night and what drives their business.</p><p>Revathi talked about channel. Really, really important. We have 10,000-some channel partners around the globe. If just a couple -- if each one of those channel partners just has a couple of folks out there calling on customers representing Eaton, you can imagine the amount of opportunity that we get generated in terms of understanding what keeps our customers awake.</p><p>Our own commercial enterprise. Revathi mentioned some 1,700 sales resources in North America; we have some 8,800 around the world. That's both outside and inside and customer support people -- it's not just salespeople -- but a very large presence with people out there talking to customers every day.</p><p>I think Revathi mentioned this, a significant service presence around the world. What better way to understand what keeps your customers awake and what their real problems are than to be out there in the trenches with them every day, arm in arm, solving problems.</p><p>Clearly it's not just a great revenue-generation engine for the Company and a margin generator; it's an opportunity generator. It really helps us understand our customers.</p><p>I'll skip one and go to the last. One there I'm pretty truly passionate about because I used to run one of them. Here in North America we have a network of geographically located solution centers. They're little manufacturing sites that are located around the country.</p><p>They're there to do things quick and special for customers. Often, and very often, customers walk in; they've got a difficult problem. And we have the manufacturing capability right there in the region with technical people to support them and actually create a solution, deliver that solution to the customer in an hour or in a day or in a week.</p><p>And oftentimes the problem we solve in one part of the country customers have all over the place. It gives us the chance to quickly scale that thing around the country.</p><p>So critical here -- probably the most critical innovation starts with the customer, our ability to understand what they need. And we think we have -- we are well positioned in this area.</p><p>Yes. Okay, second. As I said, technology, technical solutions in Electrical -- important. You need to have a bunch of smart people, and those smart people need to have the tools to do their job.</p><p>So 10,000 people around the world doing R&amp;D. And, by the way, those are electrical engineers, those are electrical folks, obviously a significant number of those with advanced degrees.</p><p>We divide them into two areas, right? So we get R and D, the left being research. We've got groups of people; Sandy mentioned our innovation centers.</p><p>Those people are doing research, real science. They're advancing the state-of-the-art. They're solving really difficult technical problems and creating things that we can use to solve problems for customers.</p><p>They work on significant areas of expertise. The ones that are important to Electrical are shown here.</p><p>And then the development work, right? So this is the people that are sitting in our business unit headquarters around the world, that are taking the technology, matching it up to the customer needs that we've identified, and actually launching real products in the marketplace.</p><p>Critical asset for them is this stability to test, right? We have a highly regulated industry, serious need to certify and test our products.</p><p>So we maintain a network, a very, very robust network of laboratories around the world that allow us to certify our products. And when we have extra capacity we actually can certify competitive products.</p><p>Clearly, as many smart people as we have, we don't have all the answers. So we need to maintain partnerships and relationships with universities and government agencies around the world so that we have access to the best and brightest and the latest thinking in technologies around the world. So clearly that's a big technical asset for us.</p><p>We also cooperate with other industrial partners. An example is shown here. For the sake of time I won't go through details.</p><p>Then something that's often overlooked is our need as a technical innovator -- so somebody that's involved in these technical things -- is to maintain our relationships and to help the standards organizations around the world; quite a few of them -- that's only a small list -- but quite a few of these standards organizations, to help them. Help ourselves understand what they are doing and help them evolve the safety standards around the world.</p><p>Last but not least, as all good things at Eaton, you need to have a process. You heard about Eaton Business System, and this is our innovation process. We call this the growth and innovation funnel.</p><p>It's not a difficult process, but it is a process. It allows us to sort through the opportunities. We understand what's important, which ones we should be working on next.</p><p>You can see for us in the Electrical Sector, a fairly sizable amount of stuff sitting in that funnel. There's $8 billion to $12 billion worth of ideas, worth of opportunities at some stage -- that's measured as mature year revenues -- that is in that funnel at any one time.</p><p>Really two important stages here prelaunch and PROLaunch. Prelaunch is where we are working through experimenting and understanding whether we have the technical readiness, the commercial readiness and the manufacturing capability to build something, right?</p><p>If we don't, we're working through a series of experiments to get that technology in place, and we're working hard on understanding the commercial readiness. Do we have the right go-to-market channel? Do we have the right sales team, right? You can clearly out-innovate your ability to sell.</p><p>Oh, by the way, the more important thing is, will customers value, will customers pay for, and are we going to be able to grow with the innovation out in the marketplace? So critical part of prelaunch.</p><p>Clearly when we're done and we think we've got -- look, we can technically do it, we can commercially do it, and we can build it, we'll run it through a disciplined execution process we call PROLaunch. And that's nothing more than making sure we deliver what we said we were going to deliver on time, on budget, and on spec and get a product launched from concept to actual launch.</p><p>Quick peek inside that green slice there, just give you an idea of the kind of projects we're working on. We classify them in a different set of rating range, and about a quarter of those we call breakthroughs. Breakthrough for us is a technology that the customer has never seen, or technology that we have that we have never applied in a way that we are going to apply it in this particular area.</p><p>Clearly a third of the stuff we work on, feature, function, additions to existing product lines, enhancement sort of things. And the rest, that big group in the middle, doesn't rise to the level of one, but it's clearly a significant innovation for customers, and that's clearly the bulk of what we're working on.</p><p>What does all that bring to us? Clearly Sandy mentioned these numbers: a significant intellectual property portfolio and a portfolio that continues to grow and grow nicely. Recognition from the industry, industrial associations around the world, as a global innovator. And we think some distinctive expertise in solving difficult technical problems for customers.</p><p>In the next few slides I'll share with you how those, how that expertise manifests itself in solutions for customers. A series of examples.</p><p>First one, this one is from our lighting business. I just want you to envision this application: you've got a mining shovel.</p><p>This mining shovel is running 24/7/365. And mines are not in garden spots, so they are in difficult environments. They are dirty, they're dusty, they're grimy. And they are oftentimes pretty hot in the summer, pretty cold in the winter.</p><p>And this big shovel is run by a diesel engine. Clearly diesel engines have lots of vibration. So since they run 24/7, you have to have a light on the outside, and you have to have a light underneath.</p><p>So there's about a dozen lights, 10 to 15 lights on this shovel. And lo and behold -- I didn't realize this until I actually started putting this presentation together -- the light technology, the light source technology on these shovels until recently was incandescent lamps. Incandescent lamps have a problem: they are a filament-based kind of lamp, and filaments under heat don't like something called vibration.</p><p>You can imagine this incandescent light on the shovel sitting out there under vibration in these terrible temperatures. No surprise those lights needed to be replaced quite often. You can see, every two weeks you've got to replace a light.</p><p>Clearly huge downtime problem for the shovel operator. And clearly if they are not running there's issues with fines.</p><p>Obviously, LED came along, so great technology here, because it's not filament-based. But the innovation here is not about LED. The innovation here is about taking LED and all the electronics associated with LED, putting it into a package, a very small package, a very robust package that can withstand terrible cold, terrible heat, terrible environment, and provide long life.</p><p>Clearly this luminaire we've put out works quite well and delivers 60,000 hours of service to a customer. And by the way, a better quality of light, okay?</p><p>So think about what I said about solving a customer problem, what's important to each customer and its being different: same fixture, same exact fixture, very different value proposition. Take that same fixture and put it in a mine shaft; or take that same fixture and put it on an oil rig; or take that same fixture and put it in a refinery. Now instead of just 10 you might have 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 fixtures.</p><p>What's important to those customers is energy efficiency. If you take the same solution, 85% energy efficiency, very meaningful to those customers. Very different value prop with the same solution.</p><p>This one is probably close to home for many people these days on the East Coast, with all the power outages we've been having. This is about utilities. Clearly power outages are a significant drain on the economy.</p><p>Where do power outages typically happen? When the power is out, it's not because the power station is out; it's not because the transmission lines were down. It's because the distribution utility network has a problem.</p><p>The distribution utility network is that thing you see when you're driving around your neighborhood or you're driving down a road near the shopping center. It's those lines you see on the wooden poles.</p><p>It's not the lines you see on the big transmission towers; those don't typically have any problem. It's those lines that are on the telephone pole. It's those green boxes in your neighborhood.</p><p>The distribution utility network is the most susceptible to problems. The ice goes on the lines and pulls them down; that doesn't happen on transmission networks. Cars hit the wooden pole and drop the lines. A backhoe digs up the line in an neighborhood.</p><p>Really it's a complex environment, getting more complex with intermittent loads connected to the grid, things like solar and wind. So a distribution network engineer's life is difficult.</p><p>Two innovative solutions here by Eaton to allow distribution network engineers to do an effective job of, number one, designing the most robust network they can possibly put out there. Software tool allows a distribution utility network engineer to configure a network and see what's going to happen, and play what-if games, to put the most robust and most power quality-oriented utility network in place.</p><p>And the second software package is one that actually helps the utility run the network. It's a tool, it sits out there, runs on their networks, constantly sensing what's going on. And says: if this happens, if I lose service here, how do I quickly isolate -- how do we quickly locate, quickly isolate that fault and restore service quickly and automatically?</p><p>Again the network engineer puts together scenarios with switches that are automated. So when something happens, boom, they can put the network online. So fault location isolation and service restoration. One utility, partial deployment on a number of feeders in their network, obviously saves significant, very significant number of outage minutes and improves customer service.</p><p>This one, I use a metaphor here; I think it's a good one. Think about this as: why use a sledgehammer when a ballpeen hammer will actually do the job?</p><p>What we're talking about is energy efficiency directives in Europe. What they said was, you have two issues.</p><p>Number one, all motors have got to be energy efficient; and if you're not going to use a really energy-efficient motor, you've got to put a variable frequency drive on it. And the other thing they said was: all applications where you're using mechanically dampened solutions to control things like airflow, or water or fluid flow -- so imagine, the motor goes on, it blows air. And the way they control the volume is they turn a damper; or the way -- turn a motor on, let it run 100%; and they want to control the fluid flow, they turn a valve. Those are mechanically dampened applications.</p><p>The EU said: all mechanically dampened applications you must put a variable frequency drive on. So that's great; we love variable frequency drives, by the way. You heard Sandy talk about this.</p><p>Two pictures on the board here in the middle, those are the two variable frequency drive platforms we launched in 2014. That story would be yet another slide and talk about innovation; and that's not what I want to talk about.</p><p>That's the sledgehammer. Because think about a variable frequency drive is, it's really complicated. Just look at it. It's got lots of buttons, lots of screens, and it takes a technician to go start those things up.</p><p>To meet the European energy regulations, you don't need a sledgehammer. What you need is a ballpeen hammer.</p><p>The issue here is energy efficiency. So why not design an optimal-cost energy efficiency device, not a drive -- which is exactly what we did.</p><p>We launched in January what we think is a very innovative product. It's aimed at energy efficiency and it's aimed to do it in the most cost-effective way possible.</p><p>It takes the place of what we called a motor starter. A motor starter is what you used to use; it just started the motor.</p><p>We've put drive technology into a different form factor, so that drive technology is in a device that mounts like a motor starter, wires like a motor starter, and is really familiar to the electrician that is doing the work. So it's very comfortable for them.</p><p>By the way, you take it out of the box, you click it where it goes, and in many, many cases zero startup. It just runs.</p><p>You connect your mechanical damper actuation system, and the thing will run. So really simple right out of the box. Very, very different approach -- again, use the ballpeen hammer -- and you can see the savings: some 60% less installed cost versus a variable frequency drive.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. We love variable frequency drives; we have them, and we sell them. But this is just an example of taking a little bit of a different approach to solving what I think is the right problem with the right product.</p><p>Okay, this is an example of innovation isn't always about product and innovation isn't always complicated. This is an oil rig or an FPSO. You guys may have seen these, right?</p><p>These are gigantic structures. They look like small cities, and in those structures there is an enormous amount of electrical wiring.</p><p>With Eaton's acquisition of Cooper and the B-Line business, we make a whole family of cable support structure products. No offense to my friends listening in Highland, Illinois, that are in the B-Line business; but at the end of the day, our cable management business is bent metal. It's bent and welded metal, okay?</p><p>So that's not the most complicated thing in the world, but obviously is some innovation to reduce the weight and increase the strength of that offering, so that we could hold more cable. The interesting thing here is that the value proposition isn't anything to do about cable. The value proposition here is for the rig builder, the guy that builds the rig.</p><p>If you can reduce the weight of your cable management system that sits above the waterline, you can reduce times a factor of 4 -- well, 3 times more, because for every unit of weight above you've got to have another unit of weight to support it and two units of weight below. So for every unit of weight you take out above the waterline, you take three more out of that rig.</p><p>So instead of selling to an electrician or selling to the electrical installer, what we're doing is we're selling the weight-reduction technology, the weight-reduction capability to the rig builder. So clearly innovation here.</p><p>Yes, there is some innovation in product, but more innovation about who we're selling to, how we approach the sale, and when we approach the sale. Because typically now you've got to go to the rig builder before he designs the rig, because he's got to design the product into the system. So again, very different innovation, not about product necessarily, more about process.</p><p>This one is about machine builders. This is something we called SmartWire; I believe you saw it on Revathi's slide as well. This is an example of what I'll call very disruptive and transformative innovation.</p><p>It's transformative because it is transforming the way machine builders build machines. If you are a machine builder, the number-one issue -- or the guy that wires the machine, the number-one issue you've got in your manufacturing process is wiring. Wiring by its very nature is complicated.</p><p>Think about a panel going down a manufacturing line, one of these panels, the one on the left. You've got a technician on the floor who's got to run the wires here.</p><p>What is he typically doing? He's typically looking at a wiring diagram. He's having to figure out: okay, I got to cut the wire so long; I got to mark it on both ends; I got to strip it; I got to route it. And by the way, I got to make sure it's connected to the right terminals on both sides.</p><p>Then it goes through all the rest of the process and it ends up at the factory at the test line, and hopefully it's all done right. Very significant costs, very significant time. Typically the largest single bottleneck in any factory is right here in wiring.</p><p>This is a really revolutionary way of thinking about wiring differently. What we've done is we've embedded a small microprocessor in a very small connector; and that connector clips onto a ribbon cable.</p><p>What it allows a machine builder to do is not even have a wiring diagram on the factory floor to run wiring. He literally just snakes that green ribbon cable in the most mechanically effective way through the panel; clips the microprocessor base connector. Very inexpensive, connects it to things as simple as pushbuttons.</p><p>And it allows at the end of the line, you plug a computer in. And because of there is patented technology in the chip, which does autoaddressing and autodiscovery, you don't need to do -- you don't even need to have a wiring diagram on the floor. Incredible value for machine builders.</p><p>You might also notice -- again, we could talk about three or four more innovations here; I'll just point one more out, is -- notice in the top row here, the panel to the right, there is no more I/O. You don't need I/O anymore when you use this intelligent microprocessor chip. You completely eliminate an entire category of product in these things.</p><p>Really, this has been around for a couple, three years. But I think the interesting thing we've done with this is we now expanded it to our entire range of control products. You even heard Craig talk about how we're taking this product now and putting it outside these control panels.</p><p>So we are connecting that little chip into things like sensors, machine sensors, and things that are running around on a machine, as well as even to things that aren't even really electrical and are hydraulic valves. It allows the machine builder to not only do better in the box but a lot of reduction outside the box as he runs around his machine.</p><p>Last example, and this is example I think I would call this the two ways to skin a cat. So the same problem, safety. You heard Tom talk about us being an industry leader in safety, and I think we really are. We have a complete portfolio of safety products.</p><p>So dealing with arc flashes -- so arc flashes are very violent events. You can see that they reach 3 times the temperature of the surface of the sun in milliseconds. It's a really -- it's a catastrophic event when one of these things happen.</p><p>Two technologies that deal with it. First one on the top, we have a whole series; in fact, every one of our switchgear products that we offer, we have what's called arc resistant versions. Basically that allows, when the arc happens we basically contain the arc and vent it to a place where it can't hurt anybody that's sitting in front of the equipment. The latest version of that is our medium voltage drive, as you can see.</p><p>Completely different technology, typically used in Europe: I call it the airbag for switchgear, because it works exactly like an airbag, okay? Just like in your car, when you hit, you have an accident. There is a sensor in your bumper that says: aha, you're having an accident; I better activate the airbag.</p><p>Same exact thing happens here, except we do it with light. So light, arc flash -- an arc flash is a light event. It has a very characteristic waveform.</p><p>What we do is we take the -- we sense the light through a fiber optic cable that's running through a switchgear. Once we see that light, we say: aha, this is an arc flash. We wait a few milliseconds to make sure, and as soon as we understand that it is an arc flash we explode an airbag.</p><p>It's the device in the bottom. It literally explodes like an airbag.</p><p>What it does is it puts a short circuit across the incoming lines; and I won't go into all the technical reasons for it. But basically what it does is it just clamps the event. It doesn't allow the source to feed the fault.</p><p>What you end up with is a little bit of damage in the cubicle that that little device sits in. You've got to replace it, just like you got to replace the airbag in your car.</p><p>The good news, though is your car, you've got to take it to the body shop. This one, you just replace that little device and the busbar it's attached to, and you're done. So it's a very innovative technology around reducing -- instead I say managing the arc, it actually eliminates it, which is really unique.</p><p>So, six examples. I think I made the point that depending on how you apply them, obviously we're solving really important issues for customers. I could have showed you probably 60 more of these. So just really, I think, really good examples about how we're adding value for our customers.</p><p>In closing, I think two main points. First, the opportunity. If you take one thing away from this it's there is an almost limitless supply of opportunities to solve big customer problems in our business. We are not going to run out of ideas and we are not we to run out of problems to solve anytime soon.</p><p>You saw the issues with electricity. You know what's going on with demand. And just the variable diversity of the customers we serve is enormous. So great opportunity.</p><p>Clearly we think we have great capabilities in the business around customer engagement and technical capabilities. Hopefully those examples have demonstrated that to you.</p><p>We started this by saying innovation is critical, and it really is critical. I think we can create tremendous value for our customers, real opportunity for us, as we're creating tremendous value for Eaton in terms of both growth and margin expansion by being able to do this. So it's really a great opportunity.</p><p>With that, I'm going to welcome Mark Eubanks.</p><p>MARK EUBANKS, PRESIDENT, COOPER LIGHTING DIVISION, EATON CORPORATIONPLC: Good morning. My name is Mark Eubanks. I've been with our lighting business since 2006 and came over to Eaton via the Cooper acquisition. Since that time in 2006, there has been more change in our industry likely than since we left gas lamps for electric lightbulbs back in the Thomas Edison days.</p><p>I think the other thing to really think about is people always talk about past events as the good old days. In our industry, the good old days are today and really out in the future. In the next 30 minutes I'm going to walk through why we think this is the case.</p><p>A couple of facts about the lighting industry to really set the backdrop for why we think that LED lighting is one of the next megatrends. Today if you look, 20% of all electricity consumed is consumed by lighting. That's a staggering amount and a big target for efficiency gains.</p><p>The DOE in the United States here projects that almost 75% of all lighting by the year 2030 will be LED. We don't think that's the case. We probably think it's a conservative estimate and likely a higher number going forward.</p><p>But even if you take that, think about the efficiency gain that's possible. This represents the equivalency of taking out 50 1,000-megawatt power plants. That's a staggering fact.</p><p>Think about the greenhouse gas emissions reduction: 38 million passenger cars coming off the road. This is a huge opportunity for our industry to really lead in sustainability and efficiency.</p><p>Our business is a large and diverse business relative to our peer group. If you think about the end markets we serve, the products we have, and really the geographic coverage, our reach is both global as well as very high in technology.</p><p>The most exciting part of our business, though, today, really is the third line here, is the growth rates. We've demonstrated since 2011 the ability to generate double-digit CAGRs over that time period. This is a great platform for us to continue to move forward and lead the industry.</p><p>We go to market with many, many well-known product brands that customers around the world trust and associate safety, reliability, and efficiency with. For instance, the Crouse-Hinds brand really is a leader in the harsh and hazardous environment. Or our Halo recessed lighting, the number-one choice of home builders and contractors for residential applications.</p><p>And then relay the emerging part of our portfolio is the integrated lighting controls from Fifth Light, delivered through some of our big product brands like McGraw-Edison and Metalux. Eaton as an entity really is a complete product solution for us to deliver the efficiency gains and the promise that our industry holds.</p><p>Here we show some of the represented end markets that we serve. And while these are only a few, they are some of the large ones that we've spent decades investing, both in salesforces, our marketing teams and application teams, to really be able to serve.</p><p>As Frank mentioned, with our multigenerational product planning cycles we really start with an end market, start with an application, and then work backwards to create products and solutions that serve those. Many of these applications ebb and flow with the economic cycles, and we're always positioned for these green shoots depending on the most attractive end markets.</p><p>Also, Revathi also mentioned this: we've got lots of touch points throughout the entire value chain. I'll talk more about this later when we talk about the value chain.</p><p>But really from a direct salesforce and an agency network here in North America and around the globe, we've got one of the largest salesforces in the world and in the industry. If you think about what the driving force for our salesforce is, it is really to be able to communicate directly to these customers, to be local, to be relevant, and to be able to help with solving problems around applications, code compliance, and energy efficiency goals.</p><p>Our marketing and education really have global reach. If you see some of these images, you can see our presence is in many locations around the world, in our Eaton technology experience centers that house all of our Eaton products, not just our lighting products, as well as global trade shows, whether that be Light Fair International here in the US, Light and Build over in Europe, or Offshore Technology Conference located in several locations. But this is where customers are able to come out and see a very prominent industry leader, and challenge us, and alert us to some of the trends and challenges they are facing.</p><p>The other really significant tool that we use is our -- the SOURCE education center. Some of you here I think have toured our facility and understand the power of what we have there.</p><p>It's a 35,000 square feet experience center that really is second to none in the industry. It's an education, training, and real technology experience for customers to see real-world applications in real-world venues to take advantage of technology that's emerging in our industry.</p><p>All customers can't travel to these trade shows; all customers can't see our experience centers; and all customers don't come to our headquarters. So we're also willing to come see our customers directly, take our show on the road.</p><p>In our most recent technology roadshow, we spent 100 days visiting 28 cities throughout North America and reached over 4,300 customers. Compare that with 15,000 customers that came through our SOURCE LED education center. That's over 20,000 customers that we were able to touch last year with a dedicated experience with Cooper -- I mean our Eaton's Cooper lighting technology, both LED and controls.</p><p>So as we think about putting all these things together, one of the sheer ways to protect our innovation really is around technology and intellectual property. We think about this in a very serious way.</p><p>As you can see, the input and output of our patent filings and patent issuances have really jumped up here in the last few years. This is a clear indication of the amount of research and amount of development and the amount of investment we are putting into the space.</p><p>I think this is also a good, clear indication and an early indicator of really our new product velocity that you can expect to see in the future, using some of these proprietary technologies and protected solutions.</p><p>So all of these investments, we've proven we're going to invest in customers; we are going to invest in the channel; we are going to invest in technology and innovation. But this is where the real scorecard comes out. How are we doing? How are we measuring the return on these investments we're making?</p><p>As you can see, the chart on the left is year-over-year quarterly growth rates of our lighting revenue, compared to just our three largest competitors in the space. As you can see, we're not only sitting in the top of that group, but we are also continuing to see a growth, an acceleration of those growth rates. This is likely the most exciting -- one of the most exciting opportunities we have in the business.</p><p>Then look to the right. We think about the quantity of the portfolio. We also like to think about the quality, quality meaning the technology richness of our portfolio.</p><p>If you look on the right here, these are the comparisons of LED penetration rates of these same competitors relative to ours. More than 50% of our revenue today comes from LED-based lighting and luminaire systems, and this continues to grow. This is a figure that many are starting to report very publicly and so are we, and we are proud of where our portfolio has evolved.</p><p>I want to refer you back to one of the slides that Sandy used just after the Cooper acquisition to really think about strategic rationale of why the acquisition. I want to apply it really to our lighting business.</p><p>If you think about the real tenets around safety, efficiency, and reliability, lighting fits the bill in all three of those. Whether it's the LED efficiency that we talked about and the real gains that are out there, or really just the emergency and general illumination that creates productivity and safety environments for our customers in their facilities, this certainly fits the bill and is in alignment with this downstream power management vision.</p><p>Here's an image that can really highlight the breadth and depth of the portfolio to address customer needs. This happens to be a hospital campus, but could very easily be a refinery or a manufacturing facility or a university or a high-rise hotel like we're in today.</p><p>We've got solutions for almost every application here -- in fact, ran out of space to put more. From roadway LED-based lighting with wireless controls, to daylight harvesting, patient room controls, patient room lighting, and even a full campus digitally addressable solution that allows us to monitor, manage, and maintain and control every luminaire in a facility.</p><p>This is something that's very powerful, that can be managed through software, that gives customers the kind of granularity and optionality that they've never had in the past. This is a key opportunity for us, or a key building block for the future opportunity for our business.</p><p>Here's a look at the outlook of where we think the business can go and where we think it's going to grow. There are some really key fundamental tenets around the industry that are tailwinds for our business.</p><p>Energy costs are continuing to increase. We've got more people who need more power with a finite amount of resources. This will continue to be the case going forward.</p><p>Legislation will continue to increase and intensify, and I'll talk specifically about that in a second as well. But this is something that also drives adoption in many of these technologies; and really LED and controls is the way to accomplish it.</p><p>And then the increasing social responsibility, social responsibility around sustainability. Sandy mentioned it earlier. We have customers like Eaton that are electing to build buildings to certain standards like LEED that really require our products and technology to get there.</p><p>Up until the front end of this chart, if you see the before 2013, for five years, really the last five years, we've been working on the real -- just the conversion of LED -- to LED from traditional light sources, whether that be fluorescent, incandescent, or HID. But that story I wouldn't say has played out, because we've still got half our portfolio to go.</p><p>But the product roadmaps and the technology roadmaps really are coming into pretty sharp focus for us. It's about now executing and commercializing the rest of those ideas.</p><p>But today, we're focused disproportionately on this physical and functional integration of controls and solid-state lighting. This is the opportunity to do more than just light up rooms and light up buildings. We think there is a optionality that will exist with this kind of convergence that many other industries have seen in the technology space.</p><p>If you look here, you can see where our traditional sources -- these are the red region on the chart. These are non-LED-based sources.</p><p>These have continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio, as I mentioned, and will continue to decline. If history is any judge of the future, we likely are being conservative here and think that the technology advances even faster, as I mentioned.</p><p>The top half of the graph really is the green and the purple zone, are both LED-based sources. The differentiation here is the green zone is standalone devices that are solid-state in nature, but are dumb. They are connected to outside systems or utilize outside peripherals to control them.</p><p>Whereas the purple region is where we think all the growth is going to come in the industry. This is really leveraging the converged platforms of both solid-state lighting and controls, both sensors and actuators. This will be where we think the optionality for our business and for our customers' solutions will really accelerate into the future.</p><p>It's worth noting here that -- if you don't have your calipers out on this -- but the purple region really is the controlled converged solution. We think this will be 50% or better of our portfolio by 2018. That likely, like the other predictions, is likely a light prediction going forward.</p><p>Let's talk about this convergence and really break down where we are and where we focus in the value chain. If you think back in the conventional days, and let's -- the bad old days, not the good old days. Back prior to 2008, this is how -- the top half of the chart is where we would have focused, on the right side in conventional luminaires.</p><p>We would be thinking about the luminaire applications, really investing in our brands, in our channel, and in our customer applications. We spent an inordinate amount of time developing salesforces focused on architects, engineers, lighting designers, EPCs, contractors, distributors, as well as end-users.</p><p>This is where all of our investment was because the light source technology for us was really about selecting components from one of the two or three large global OEMs that were vertically integrated, all the way from glass and silica all the way up to light bulbs and ballasts. This was the business model and really offered very little opportunity for differentiation from our other luminaire competitors.</p><p>We all differentiated around fit and finish. But for the most part, our products were very similar and really forced us to compete more on price and scale in the marketplace.</p><p>Fast forward to today and you can see that this shift really has changed. We're still investing heavily in the channel, as Revathi said.</p><p>We have the biggest salesforce that we've ever had. We've got the most technical salesforce that we've ever had, really focused on delivering these solutions and delivering value to our customers and understanding these customer-backed applications.</p><p>But at the same time we've taken the opportunity to also double down, thinking about research and development, thinking about new product development, further back upstream. Not only to take advantage of the value-add in the hardware and the parts and pieces, but really to be able to take advantage of an integrated solution that lets us leverage the proprietary solutions and control methodologies as well as the form factors of the products to deliver a better solution for our customers.</p><p>We still have a great supply chain, still have great suppliers that help us in the technology world. But this is where we are focused.</p><p>If you walked around Light Fair or Light and Build in the last couple years, specifically this year, you walked in our booth and see our products, and then walked to two or three other manufacturers, you would not have seen similar-looking products. I think this is a great thing for our industry.</p><p>10 years ago you walked in our booths, we all had the same-looking products, same core technologies, same lamp and ballast solutions. That's not the case today and won't be the case in the future. And we think it's a great opportunity to really differentiate our business not only from our competitors, but really from the rest of our history.</p><p>I mentioned I'd talk about the codes a little bit. This is a clear driver of some of the government-mandated and regulatory-legislated environment that really is helping move the efficiency story.</p><p>If you see the map on the top left here there is a color coding of where all the active code legislation is in the United States, state-by-state. One of the early leaders of all energy code progression and energy efficiency technology is California.</p><p>California passed the latest version of Title 24 last year, midyear. That code mandated mandatory requirements for more granular-level control. This is individual control, auto-on and manual-on and -off for individual rooms, demand-response inside of lighting control solutions, all adding more technology and rich features to a required solution.</p><p>That's forced manufacturers and suppliers like ourselves to really develop leading technology to be able to accomplish these goals. We're in the early innings of this as well. We think this will continue to intensify, and we've got a great opportunity to really be able to be a trusted partner for our customers.</p><p>Green programs. I mentioned the sustainability, the voluntary programs. This does continue as well.</p><p>LED lighting and controls is one of the best ways to accomplish lots of credit for qualifying for one of these classifications. We've seen it, and the trend increased dramatically over the past few years.</p><p>Another example of a public customer, the GSA has mandated -- since 2010 has mandated that all buildings have digitally addressable light fixtures. That means whether it's LED or not, requirements are that each fixture can be addressed and controlled individually.</p><p>Conventional techniques with analog devices make this virtually impossible or very expensive to do. Digital luminaires, converged electronics, converged sensors and actuators give us a great opportunity to not only achieve those goals but also deliver a more significant solution.</p><p>Here is a real-world example of how the energy codes have advanced and how our technologies have changed to get there. If you look at the top left, the box with the grid is actually a ceiling plan for a 25,000 square foot typical office floorplate. Back in the 1970s when the first energy codes came out, zones of control were 5,000 square feet or larger. Can you imagine a large home was the zone of control?</p><p>Really 20% to 30% saving was achieved by using really crude techniques, time clocks and relay panels that would sweep entire areas of a floor off. In fact, businesses basically because of these codes trained employees to not come to work early and to not work late, because the lights were going off. This is the kind of trade-off that we had to give up to get this kind of energy savings.</p><p>Fast-forward to the turn of the century, the most recent century, and codes changed. Codes changed to a smaller space, 2,000 square feet or smaller; and really the advancement of occupancy sensor technology was helpful in doing this. We were able to accomplish more savings, 30% to 50% energy savings, over traditional uncontrolled areas; but still a very inflexible system relative to large spaces.</p><p>Then till today, now codes have even advanced further, as I've mentioned. Customer requirements are advancing further, even absent of codes, to really get down to 150 square foot control zones. That's effectively personal space.</p><p>The only way to do that would be to individually control every light fixture. As I mentioned, conventional technologies, analog devices will not be the way that gets done. Advanced sources, software, communication protocols, as well as converged electronics are the answer to solving these smart lighting solutions.</p><p>Here's another look at the pervasive nature of lighting. We used to think about our business as light bulbs with sheet metal wrapped around them and differentiate over very small aesthetic details.</p><p>This is not the case anymore. We've got the opportunity today to deploy solid-state LED lighting luminaires that just by their installation on their own generate drastic energy savings, anywhere from 30% to 90% depending on the light source that they are replacing. As well, you get lifetime benefits, and certainly controllability is part of that.</p><p>Going forward, we're thinking about this in a whole different way. We're thinking about we're deploying microprocessor-based, high-density sensor networks that happen to be giving off light. And by the way, the opportunity to control and measure and monitor the space that this equipment and the real estate that it occupies -- whether it be a ceiling, a wall, or a street lighting pole -- gives us the opportunity to be the hub for data and building information and collection, and also extend optionality and control capabilities out to our customers.</p><p>This is where customers are continuing to look for a more sophisticated solution from a more sophisticated supplier. There's only a few companies in the world capable of doing this; Eaton is one of them, and we are excited about the opportunity to really take our business to the future.</p><p>So if you think about all that I've talked about today, we've got a great business with a great platform. Growing, diverse, really positioned to win.</p><p>We're not spending -- all the money we're spending is going forward. We're not spending any money restructuring. We're not spending any money going backwards trying to close down factories with old technology. Everything we are doing is about playing offense, both on the technology side as well as on the channel side.</p><p>This expansion of light points will continue because of the technology. But it will continue because of the optionality and the focus that we think we'll give customers going forward. The embedded intelligence and communications and the pervasive nature of the real estate we occupy really do set our business up and our customers for Big Data optionality that they didn't have certainly with traditional sources, and they don't have today without these converged integrated control solutions.</p><p>The industry and the future is bright, to use a pun. But the industry is part of something that we take as a steward of the industry, and think that we're positioned to win, and look forward to showing you that in the years to come. Thanks.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DON BULLOCK: Now I think Tom, Revathi, and Frank will come up for Q&amp;A. Don't go anywhere. I'll just leave this up here to jog your thoughts.</p><p>Okay, the first hand was right back there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: This question is for Revathi. So Revathi, how do you think about your distribution strategy as it relates to adding new distributors as opposed to potentially replacing less profitable distributors that are within your footprint today? And I would also love for you to comment on what you're seeing across the sector. Are you seeing consolidation in the sector? What is the opportunity from a cost perspective with your distributor strategy?</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI: Okay, so I will start with the first one. How we think about distribution and which distributors to partner with, it's a complex story just like I said in my presentation. So we pick and choose the best distributors based on the segment, based on the investments they are making in that segment and based on what geography they are covering and whether we need that presence or not.</p><p>And typically profit margins with distributors are more focused around what they are doing in the marketplace and we are usually able to help them in terms of positioning them in the right segment with the right product, so it's a win-win for both. So we don't pick and choose distributors based on what the profit margins are between us and them. We are able to position that fairly well based on the segment they are participating and the geography. And we have been doing that for a while, so we have woven that web fairly well.</p><p>I would say the second part would be there is distributor consolidation happening. It is a fragmented industry and we continue to see that. We continue to see that within the super regionals and we continue to see that between the super regionals and the nationals. We expect that to continue and as that happens, we look at our footprint, see what that means to us and move forward with our existing strategy, but defined for growth with those distributors. But we expect that consolidation to continue to some extent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kind of a multifaceted question just around your footprint as it exists today as you digest Cooper. Just a little bit surprised you still have 40% to go on the plant and distribution part of the integration. Also, as Rick mentioned, CapEx is running well above [D]. I just wonder if that is going on in the electrical business and as part of the integration. And kind of the third part, the question would be there is kind of background in the conversation here that M&amp;A may again assert itself as a priority. Maybe just comment on the wherewithal of the organization at this point in time (inaudible).</p><p>TOM GROSS: So the question is really relative to you may recall the left side of that Cooper crossed out synergy in case somebody didn't hear it was listed as 60% complete and that was the heavy lifting around plants and distribution centers and why only 60%, if I can paraphrase it. So we don't count that, Jeff, as it is 60% complete. We count something complete when it is finished. So if you look at the remaining 40%, they are all well underway, but we wanted to be transparent from the standpoint of what has really wrapped up. So you definitely adjust that number upwards probably closer to 75% if you really look at what's done.</p><p>All of those announcements are made. It involves about 60 plants, so this is big-time stuff, lots of distribution centers, so we are actually pretty pleased with where we are at because we are 60% done and a really good amount done with the rest of the 40%. So I think we are fine relative to the objective of finishing it by the end of the year, but I am pretty sure we'll be still wrapping stuff up in November, December. So I don't think there's a lot of pad there.</p><p>Relative to CapEx, we are obviously investing quite a bit of capital into these restructuring projects and into the base business itself, so Rick's number that CapEx is running ahead of D is -- I'm sure electrical is a contributor to that.</p><p>And then the final part of Jeff's question was relative to future acquisitions, not necessarily who, but does management have the capacity within electrical to take on additional acquisitions. To be honest, we are just so focused on Cooper; I don't think we've really done a fair job of assessing that. I think that is all part of the date that Sandy referenced relative to midyear where we will lay out our optionality around use of cash and how we will do it and part of that will be an assessment of our readiness then.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: A couple questions. First one on the distributor advantage program, we used to hear about that kind of a thing from Cooper as well. Now you guys are doing it. Is it finally getting some teeth? What inning is that in terms of actually getting some leverage out of it, the benefits of scale versus smaller players?</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI: So Eaton had its advantage program too, or we called it something different, so this is -- most companies have some form of an incentive program. What we did was to take the Cooper and the Eaton program and put it together and try to give the best metrics of what would drive success for us. It is very well-deployed. We deployed that at the beginning of 2014. We saw the effect of the growth rates and the impact on the Cooper synergies through 2014, so very well-deployed. It's in a mature state today and I think we will continue to see the benefits from it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Frank, if you don't mind me asking, just how about a European update since this is a global program?</p><p>FRANK CAMPBELL: Yes, we took very much the same program that Revathi's team did and we deployed very similarly in Europe. There are some differences in the distribution models in Europe, vis-a-vis the US. US tends to be little bit more selective model where European tends to be a more distributed model where people do business with kind of everybody. But the program that is deployed from a marketing planning rewards program very much similar, called the same thing and deployed in Europe as well.</p><p>DEANE DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Tom, I would be interested in hearing more commentary about the state of the data center market. You sounded a bit more optimistic than one of your bigger peers in that space and in your commentary, I would love you to touch on the segmentation, the go-to-market, especially given the hyperscale customers having very unique enterprise-specific type of requirements, less UPS, but still a faster growth rate. So a lot to touch on there, but be interested in hearing your comments.</p><p>TOM GROSS: Okay, sure. I would be happy to start, but I want to make an announcement that Revathi is now the official data center expert given her last two years battling with some of the biggies, the big tech folks. We feel very good about data centers. Now the CapEx spending or the data center construction market we kind of characterize as flat. But what is occurring in that, Deane, is -- and we've outlined this before -- is the UPS is getting a bit thinner and there's a lot of reasons for that, but probably the biggest reason is the mix of data centers. There's not a fundamental change in how UPS works, but the reality is some data centers don't need the same level of backup as others. So hyperscale is a good example.</p><p>At the end of the day, if that data center is for Web surfing, if you have to reenter your www address, it's not the end of the world. So the mix has definitely been around dotcom infrastructure and that has thinned out the UPS a bit because they don't need triple redundancy and so on. But the offset of that and then some by the way and then quite a bit is data centers have evolved -- I remember a big one was 4 megawatts. We are now selling 60 megawatts data centers and so the power distribution side of this equation is 4X, 5X times the UPS.</p><p>And I'm just warming up. Lighting, cable infrastructure systems, variable frequency drives, the electrical package is accelerating and the terrific news is the UPS is still the most important and we like our product lineup. We like our service lineup. But the real game here is an electrical supplier regardless. The bigger your package, the more you like data centers. Hyperscale is a little different. I don't know if you have any comments around changes as you look forward in that segment?</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI: I think the hyperscale segment is growing well. It is growing strongly and as Tom said, the key there is that if you look at the overall electrical portfolio in hyperscale, it is very significant for us. So when you are building these 60 megawatt data centers, you have to think about it as UPS is a great place for us to start pulling through our product, but it positions the rest of our portfolio and we are really well-positioned to take advantage of the growth there. It's all about good innovative products, strong lead times, being quick to market and we are well-positioned from those areas in the hyperscale market.</p><p>TOM GROSS: And just one addition because I'm sure it is going to get asked, so I'm going to try to cut off the question and ask. If you look at the software side of data center, which gets a lot of play from tons of people, including some of our competitors, we love our position there, Deane. Our capability we put under the banner of Foreseer and Foreseer is a power analytics monitoring and control system for data centers. Many of you saw that in Kentucky when you visited us and since power is going up as the number one cost of a data center, even beyond depreciation of the equipment, managing that power grid is really important and we love our position and you can see it in the wins we've had in hyperscale, colo, across the board. We have tended to stay away from the high end let's say supervisory control of a data center, including management of servers and software and networks and stayed to our knitting. That strategy is really paying off as we become the software provider of choice of managing that ever-increasing power network.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just maybe dive deep into the currency FX impact from competition in pricing and margin across your business a little bit as we are in a very difficult environment here in a globally, competitive space. Talk about what you're anticipating, any competitive impacts --.</p><p>TOM GROSS: Yes, I think you saw from Sandy's presentation that the FX headwinds kind of conspire to eliminate the good solid organic growth we have. And we've pretty much just characterized it at that and there is not a lot of additional things to talk about. I think we've got to let the euro play out a bit to see where that goes, but obviously it is deflating our overall growth rates and we think we have more than enough levers to pull to continue to increase our margins as we showed, and I'm sure I'm speaking for Craig as well here, that we all have enough price cost reduction levers to offset any profitability impact from that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm not sure I got it correctly. It's really more pricing and marketshare and I am trying to also hit on (multiple speakers).</p><p>TOM GROSS: It's hitting our top line. It's really kind of reversing the growth that we have that's organic. I don't want to say reversing; it's really offsetting it as we translate the revenues and profit back into US dollars. So it looks like we are in neutral, but in fact there's just a lot of good organic growth underneath the hood and so we are not happy with it, but we are certainly able to deal with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'd like to ask a question about LED. I accept that there is a coming revolution in LED and it gets more interesting every day. But I thought that from an intellectual property point of view that that core of that technology was resident in the suppliers, not in new bundlers and integrators. Where do you stand on that score? How much of your future will you control or how much of it will rely on you making arrangements with the folks in Asia who clearly drive it and developing partnerships with them?</p><p>MARK EUBANKS: Sure. Maybe I wasn't clear on the intellectual property where we are developing. That value chain that I showed at the bottom really of where the luminaire and system stops and where the LED devices start, that really is the bifurcation of where that technology that you reference does reside and there is six or eight big global component suppliers that do have the intellectual property there around the LED and semiconductor devices. We are using these suppliers and their technology is being sold to us. Our IP that we are developing is really around applications. It is how we are using the devices, how we're using the system. It's all focused around optics, around thermals, around applications and around mechanical solutions, as well as our control methodology, as well as control integration. And that really is the value add and the IP that we are developing versus the real fundamental epitaxial growth process.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: One of your main competitors last week talked about US pricing starting last year bad and then improving. China on the other hand got worse over the last six months. Maybe talk if you are seeing the same trends. And then within power quality, I just wasn't sure. You said the market (technical difficulty). Within that, what is the three-phase power doing? How much is it down?</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI: Our pricing processes in terms of project pricing, we have good discipline around it, how we review projects and we know our markets really well so we know how to price for value for our customers and we see the pricing market, pricing overall to be fairly stable at this point in time. And there's always room for that to move up and down based on how the segments go, but our view is that we are in the right position in terms of our capability to price and we always do this fairly well and we may move with the market up and down, but we think that it is stable at this point in time.</p><p>TOM GROSS: Relative to China, I would say a very similar situation, pretty stable pricing. You always find pockets of highly competitive things, but overall a pretty stable environment.</p><p>The third part of your question relative to data centers, when I was referring to data center, I was generally referring to big data centers that take the big three-phase kinds of things. That market has been driven largely by big technology company investments and then also colos. And that's what I refer to as flat. Now when you get to the middle of the market, we see actually a healthier environment, not dramatically, but it is up a bit and so there's quite a few investments there that we are participating in. So if you net all that out to three phases, you end up just sort of seeing a flattish kind of environment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So you've addressed pricing in the large power assemblies. Can you just maybe comment on pricing across the electrical portfolio, generally speaking? And specifically, is the deflation in raw materials like copper, etc., is that creating some additional pricing pressure more broadly across the portfolio?</p><p>TOM GROSS: Okay, let me handle the copper question first. Obviously copper, silver and others conspiring to this. It is creating some discussions with our customers for sure. We have a very large amount of contracts that we negotiate on an annual basis with our larger customers where pricing gets set. And so the way this tends to play out is not 1000 phone calls when copper drops below a certain point. It's as those contracts come up for renegotiation, you have the discussion. So it is putting the discussion back on us of -- so you're seeing favorable economics, what are we going to do about this. We will have to manage that very well.</p><p>Price is not a huge windfall for us. That's the way we are looking at it this year. We believe it will be positive net, but not of huge magnitude, but we do not see a scenario frankly in any of the three regions and certainly therefore in total where we are going backwards in price in 2015. We don't see that at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. And just a quick follow-on. Has there been any change in the dropthrough that you realized on your sales synergies? I am just thinking here about the -- if you look at the different buckets of sale synergy, the incentive program, service mix, etc., is there a difference in dropthrough and I guess I'm trying to hone in here on does the incentive program -- is that a more volume for less margin type of sale?</p><p>REVATHI ADVAITHI: No, I mean each one is fairly comparable to our margins we have. The incentive program really whether it was Cooper or Eaton already was doing some sort of an incentive program. So it's not as though overall you reduce your margins just because you are getting growth from channel. Channel growth is usually very profitable for us. So we see that as consistent or positive. The same on -- even if you think about services and services growth in terms of synergy, that gives us good pullthrough in terms of our products that come through and with a larger portfolio, we have larger pullthrough like the transformer service I talked about. So really each bucket doesn't drive a huge significant difference from our base portfolio margin. So we find that it is fairly consistent with that.</p><p>TOM GROSS: I think a good way to just think about it in simplistic terms is the rebates are a problem of prosperity because the big realignment was more towards the Cooper formula. We pay for growth. So if you grow, the rebates grow somewhat. But growth through the channel regardless of where it is in the world has a favorable impact on our margins and basically we are giving a bit of it back to continue to encourage growth. And although we spent hundreds of hours, maybe thousands of hours on [EDEP] at the end of the day, that's the way it works. And it's kind of a safeguarded, if you know what I mean, formula from a margin perspective.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had a question in regards to the pace at which you are likely to be able to enhance your margins after we conclude the majority of the period for restructuring synergy from Cooper. It looks as though that the restructuring will account for about 89% of your profit improvement between 2014 and 2016 and somewheres near 63% of the total Company. And what kind of assumptions would we have to look for or opportunities we will have to look for for you to pursue to be able to assume that you could sustain the same type of onward profit margin improvement and overall earnings contribution growth post 2016?</p><p>TOM GROSS: Sure. That's a perfect question to end on, by the way. So I think maybe a way to start is go back to the chart -- I think it was Rick's chart -- of our margin improvement history. We have demonstrated we can consistently grow margins. There were some acquisitions in there. There are lots of years where there were no significant acquisitions. And I think we feel very positive about our ability to continue to grow margins and the reason for that is not to make it too general, but I think Frank summarized it perfectly. When you look at this opportunity set within electrical to innovate, it's not just innovation for innovation. These are really real-world problems. It's complex. It's unsafe. It's regulated. It needs to be more efficient.</p><p>By the way, from generation to consumption, a lump of coal to lightout an LED, less than 35% of the energy gets to the LED. You think about the hundreds of billions of dollars of power generated to do that, 65% gone. So these are big megatrends and I would just characterize it this way. That gives us so many opportunities to stay focused on innovation, to solve some of these problems. I haven't even added what happens when the lights go out today. It's a pretty scary world. That's just a great margin capture environment, whether it's a big acquisition year or not a big acquisition year. I don't know how to say it other than I think all of us believe that kind of the world is our oyster. There's just so much to be done and we have an opportunity to do something about it. Okay, with that, Don. Thank you.</p><p>DON BULLOCK: Thank you all very much for spending time with us today. We're going to move at this point to the lunch session of our meeting. That will be directly behind us. (Conference Instructions). For those of you joining us via webcast, we will resume the question and answers in about 30 minutes. At that point in time, thank you very much and we look forward to you joining us at lunch.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: If I could just call everybody's attention for a moment. Please continue your lunch, but we wanted to be respectful of your time here. Once again thanks for joining us for this morning. I hope you found that we shared with you a number of additional profiles and insights about our various different businesses and why we think we've got some really exciting years out ahead of us as well. I don't have any kind of preface this afternoon, so we will open the floor and if I can't answer the question, which is highly likely, I'm going to reference it to some of our experts who are here with me today. So who wants to lead us off this afternoon?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks, Sandy. So the first question is on your capital deployment plans. You had referenced about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion by the end of 2016. I guess when I think about your strategy, how are you thinking about the M&amp;A strategy from potentially a transformative acquisition versus both on acquisitions versus the decision to return it to shareholders in the near term?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Yes, thanks for the question. Because I think it is really one of the big steps for Eaton and we ought to be in position, as we said, by sometime this midyear to talk about it. We will continue our strong dividend policy and I think you know that our practice there has been to increase our dividends in line with our forward earnings expectations. And then it's going to come down to I would guess a mixture of repurchase and M&amp;A. We have not tried to put a qualifier on it, that it would be a potential big deal if we did a deal, or a small deal or a collection of deals.</p><p>I think if you look at our history and we were chatting a little bit at my table at lunch is that our history has been to do a series of smaller transactions. There just are more of them available. But having said that, we simply don't know it this year. We have not withdrawn from the M&amp;A appraisal process during this last several years, nor the courting process, so we knew a time would come when our management capacity and our financial capacity would come back into focus where we could go back on that offense and wanted to have that string of opportunities available, but a little early for us to specifically qualify that.</p><p>We are also not at a point where we can share with you that X percent would be spent on M&amp;A or X percent would be spent on share repurchase. But I think you get an indication about a little bit of our bias from what we did in the second half of this past year when we bought back $650 million of our shares. And we, as I think you would expect us to say, feel that our shares are still underpurchased. So Don does have order cards here with us for any of you who are looking for opportunities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wondering if you could comment or maybe somebody else on your team could comment about you stand on the succession plans?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Yes, I'm sure we've got a lot of people on our team who would like to comment on that. We don't have the benefit of our Board of Directors here and obviously that's a decision they will make. I think you all know because it is our policy that our elected officers retire at age 65 and that for me occurs in May of 2016. Our Board historically has not had a practice of announcing succession way in advance of any given date, so they will make that call obviously and I think they've had a lot of experience on our Board, a number of our Board members have been through a couple different successions within Eaton. So I've got a lot of confidence they will make the right choices. They will choose their time, so can't give you any particular one. There may be lotteries running in the room that I'm not aware of, but that is usually the case.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. I had a tax question, so I didn't ask it while you were sitting here. I thought maybe you would want to toss it to Rick, but there's been a large difference between cash and GAAP taxes the last couple years that now seems to be narrowing. And just wonder if you could give us some context on what is driving the narrowing and ostensibly as your headline tax rate does go up with mix, as I think it will, do those two stay tight and maybe some -- if there's any updated color on where you think the tax rate is in fact going in the next year or two?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Great. Rick, here is the question you were looking for.</p><p>RICK FEARON: (inaudible) we do think the gap between cash tax and book taxes will likely (inaudible) start to narrow. Certainly will narrow this year and probably next year as well. A lot of it has to do with we're getting through some of the unsual (inaudible) that had to be (inaudible) legal entities (inaudible) with (inaudible) tax impacts. So we will be much more in a steady-state operating mode by the end of this year.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Rick, why don't you grab a microphone because they can't hear you on the broadcast by the way?</p><p>RICK FEARON: And that -- getting back into a steady state operating mode will narrow that difference between cash and book taxes. We think the rate this year will be between 9% and 11%. To get to 9%, you would have to have reimplementation of the R&amp;E tax credit. We are not betting on that. It might happen, but the 10% midpoint of the range assumes that that is not reimplemented. And over the next few years, it is hard to know, there are a lot of things going on in the tax world, as I am sure you have noticed. The biggest of which I would say is not even what has been proposed here in the states, but it is all these OECD BEPS initiatives, which are 15 different policy papers on how international corporate taxation can change. It's very hard to know what will come out of those simply because they are complex and certainly not all agreed amongst the members of the OECD. But absent any major changes there, our rate likely to perhaps go up 1% to 2% over the next few years, but not dramatically based on everything that I see right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Rick, don't sit down yet, please. I've got another question for you. It's on FX, the 4 percentage points of headwind. Maybe just walk us through the hedging, what kind of hedging you are doing in terms of transaction hedging, not translation hedging. Maybe an update on how naturally hedged are you today. And then probably for Sandy, any color on the storm impact, storms plural, this season just in terms on the electrical side and just help us understand how it benefits and maybe or net given business interruptions. Thanks.</p><p>RICK FEARON: You're right, we have had a policy of not hedging our translation because we have regarded that as more just reporting as opposed to substantive. But we have had also a policy of hedging to the extent we can all of what I would call items on balance sheets that are in other than the functional currency. We hedge those completely and generally achieve that even though there is some complexity in managing 700 odd balance sheets.</p><p>In terms of transactional flows, meaning that you produce the product in one currency and sell it in another currency, any flows of significant magnitude we try to hedge out and so we don't have significant transaction exposure. We have a little bit because there are some flows that just don't merit hedging or some flows where the hedging costs are really quite high and so you may elect to hedge less than you might otherwise. But for the most part, our real exposure is just translation and that is really what the 4% is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>RICK FEARON: From a natural hedge standpoint, our manufacturing philosophy has been to manufacture and sell in the same region and we do that for several reasons. One, we provide better service to customers by doing that. We are much closer to customers. But two, you naturally take away most of the FX exposure because generally regions tend to have currencies that it's either one currency or the currencies are closely aligned, so you generally don't have a lot of FX exposure by doing that and that's why, with all the actions we have taken, it really is mainly a translational issue for us.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: We made that big change you may recall back in 2000, 2001 where we spent a lot of time trying to get our sourcing and manufacturing assets lined up in the zone of currency, so it's really been the same since then.</p><p>On the storm issue, we've given a lot of thought to moving additional resources to Boston. We have not yet, but there's no question this has been a harsh winter around the United States and there's also the port strike issue on the West Coast, and I would say nothing material really to report at this point. They make it more difficult but that's really sort of ours to overcome at this point.</p><p>NIGEL COE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: So Sandy, obviously, you financed the Cooper acquisition at very attractive interest rates and since that time rates have come down even more. Two times levered by the end of this year or thereabouts. How are you thinking about this unusual situation where we've got negative bond yields in Europe? Do you see an opportunity here to do something meaningful again?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: I think again, Nigel, there is no question, I think if we had looked five years ago at this period of time, none of us would have anticipated seeing these different relationships, let me call it that way, that exist at this point. And we do think they create some opportunities. It's all part of what we're going to be looking at as we get toward the middle of this year. We feel we've got important commitments at this point in terms of what we said we would repay and that's been important for us as kind of a hallmark of our credibility with so many of the institutions that have provided us liquidity over the years and so we want to continue to, obviously, fulfill that. But as we get to the middle of this year, I think as we look at issues of capital structure and how we're going to return dollars to shareholders, that's all in the mix at this point. It is a very unusual period of time and we think it is one that needs to be noted and capitalized upon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: When you think about Eaton as a power management company and you look at a couple of different paths to -- and adjacencies such as automation or other building systems that you are not already largely present in, what is your view competitively or opportunity -- forget M&amp;A -- it could be organic, lots of ways of doing it, but just the opportunity set for Eaton in those areas? Is that something that is so far afield that you feel like you've already got what you need in those spaces to grow, or in fact those areas you really need to look at more aggressively over time?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Well, I think you heard about two cuts at that this morning. The titles may not have tied it right to you, but first let's just take what Tom talked to you about Foreseer this morning. Clearly the ability to do power distribution, asset management and inventory in a data center is one that we have right now and it's a very powerful capability. The second one you heard about was from Mark Eubanks in terms of the space that exists above you whether it's in a building or a parking lot or on a highway, obviously provides you with a really unique opportunity in that area as well.</p><p>So Eaton is not without its opportunities in these areas just from an internal organic growth point of view. We don't really ever comment on the M&amp;A or specific verticals, but I think you can see us in a number of these businesses moving into areas where it's not just the physical presence of the product, but it's also our software capability to perform in a supervisory way, if you will, and we think there are real opportunities to grow in that regard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: There was a lot of stuff in the prepared remarks about how the Cooper acquisition has reduced the volatility in the earnings and significantly through the cycle and more predictability, etc. Internally there had to be thoughts that that would help the valuation of the Company just given that you have less volatility in earnings. I think you could argue actually now that the discount on Eaton stock to multi-industry peers in general maybe has even gotten bigger kind of relative to the beginning when you guys maybe would think it would do the opposite. So just wondering if you have any comments on why that hasn't improved or just anything along those lines?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: Yes, I think the discount is really an issue of whether you look at it on a pretax basis, adjusted basis, or whether you look at it on a full after-tax basis and different owners and investors have different perspectives about how long our tax rate may continue to be a significant discount to others. One of the reasons we think our Irish structure gives us a really great continuity or sustainability over time is we actually are in a place that has a very significant different tax rate by statute in this regard.</p><p>I think when we -- and I'll ask Rick to comment on this in a minute as well -- we do think our tax rate will tick up as Rick mentioned, but I know a number of you are using 15% tax rates in your models. That is not what we run. That's not what drives our cash and we think that is really an undervalued recognition at this point. I understood when we ran lower tax rates and we were a US-based company that people had concerns about it. I think that concern should be significantly less now that they were incorporated as an Irish company. Rick, do you want to add anything to that?</p><p>RICK FEARON: Yes, I would agree with you, Sandy. I think what has happened is that while we have created more stability in earnings, I think at the same time the world's in a time period where there is more discussion and uncertainty around tax rates. So I think that you've had those two factors that have impacted our valuation, but I think what has been missed is that because of our Irish domicile and because of the various actions we have taken to capitalize on that, we are not nearly as subject to exposure as a US company would be. But it will take -- I can understand how some people would like to see this over some period of time to get comfortable with that.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: I would say that the second issue, which I think is a very material one and very well understood, is that Cooper was a very exciting acquisition when it was announced, but it was announced, it wasn't concluded. And if you think about out of the savings we said we got, we said we'd get $115 million the first year, we'd get $95 million the second. That's exciting, but the next big piece is $150 million this year. It's not done yet and then there's another $115 million next year. So for those who believe the acquisition is going well and that we are doing well against all of our commitments, it makes the $150 million and the $115 million a lot more probable than if you were sitting back in the late part of 2012 and early 2013 saying I wonder how they will do with this.</p><p>I think the other aspect, for those of you who have had a chance to talk to our channel partners or any customers, you hear from them the level of success we are creating in the marketplace and that's the real enduring strength over time. So I would call that not as much of a future as it was a couple years ago and I hope you got a sense from that today that this isn't exactly what I would say in the realm of \"book it, Danno\" yet, but it's getting particularly close and we think we can see the end of this integration and it creates a very attractive stream for us.</p><p>The last item I would mention is that if you went back just a couple years ago, I think there were significant questions in terms of would the heavy-duty truck cycle ever come back. And there was a lot written about that. There has certainly been a confirmation last year and again this year, we are seeing a very important end market that is a very handsome one in terms of profit and revenue stream for the Company come on quite strongly as well. So we are doubtful to have every one of those 20-some end markets ever operating all up at the same time, but it's a pretty good time for us when you look at that balance of the overall markets right now.</p><p>ANN DUIGNAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE: Just following up on a similar theme. We don't see deep cyclical companies change their dividend policy in the good times because they always know the bad times are going to come. Have you thought at all about structurally changing your dividend as a way of expressing your confidence in the volatility in earnings going forward?</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: We think we did. When you think about we are talking about 5% -- our mid-point of our guidance this year is a 5% increase in our operating earnings per share and we just increased our dividend by 12%. And so we do think that our practice of not having either a yield or a payout methodology in terms of trying to have that dictate our dividend, but we look at it as a -- in regard to what we think our future earnings growth is going to be and clearly when you peel off the FX and the tax impact this year, we told you it would be about a 13% increase and so that 12% is -- and of course, you always end up in interesting rounding issues when you are trying to work with a cent. It's a pretty close approximation for what we think our rate going forward is.</p><p>So I think it's a message of confidence. We never cut our dividend in the 2008, 2009 time period, which I think is a reflection again of the cash flow characteristics of our Company that it's very strong through the cycle. So I think for investors who are looking to secure a portion of their return through a handsome dividend, that obviously makes Eaton a very attractive stock and Rick mentioned today we are up just a little bit over $3. We are at the high end of our peers and that's where we want to position the Company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Maybe just one other final point on tax. So just looking at my coverage universe, I have three other Irish domiciles -- [IR], Allegion, Tyco. Their tax rate is really 20%-ish and Tyco arguably is the most sophisticated and experienced of those three I rattled off in terms of being foreign domiciled for a long time and knowing how to work it and they are at 18%. So I think some of us still struggle with why even going to 15% seems like it wouldn't happen at Eaton and maybe understanding what else might be going on there that would differentiate you from the other call them foreign domiciled US companies.</p><p><person><nameText>SANDY CUTLER</nameText></person>: And again, it is no different, Jeff, than what we've talked about for maybe eight or nine years. Remember there were four key elements that number one, when Eaton acquired Westinghouse, they had a very large manufacturing platform in Puerto Rico. Most of you know the statutory rate there is 10% or below. That continues today. Some of those other companies you mentioned never have had that tax rate. That's why when we were incorporated in the US our rate was lower.</p><p>Second, very importantly and you could ask each of our executives here today, we pay our executives on an after-tax basis. There are a few companies that actually do that. And so people's sensitivity and appreciation for making tax-intelligent decisions has been part of our Company for a very long time, way low in the organization.</p><p>Third, we moved internationally after many of our competitors and so we moved post the international tax revolution when you found that many of these countries had dropped to 15% tax rates and many other people had made their investments at much higher times and so that's an important piece. That will burn off over time because other companies will make lapsing schedules in those higher areas.</p><p>And last but not least, obviously our move now to Ireland in 2012, which really helps us most fundamentally with the ability to move cash around the world and not end up with trapped cash, which obviously is really good news for our investors in that regard. So it's sort of those four items.</p><p>Well, we thank you all for joining us today. Appreciate your support and obviously Don and team are available for follow-up questions. Have a good afternoon.

The company competes with the likes of Stripe and credit card companies, and it was also one of the biggest threats to PayPalover the past few years. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. 'As a separate service offered by PayPal, Braintree will be able to scale its platform at a rate that is just not possible for a startup,' wrote PayPalCEO David Marcus[3] in a blog post today. 'PayPal's already solved many of the regulatory and logistical hurdles that will help to extend Braintree's reach to more customers in more markets even faster. Our resources will enable them to push the boundaries of innovation with ambition and confidence for consumers, merchants and developers around the world. It's business as usual for Braintree. Braintree will continue to maintain its best-in-class service for its customers and developers for the foreseeable future.' Braintree announced in July that it's now processing more than $10 billion in payments[4], and it just recently released its Venmo Touch product to the public[5], a digital 'unwallet' that other apps can access to make payments. Braintree bought Venmo last year[6] for around $26 million.\u00a0The company offers payments for 4,000 merchants, covering a potential 40 million customers, and operates in 40 countries. Its current customers including big tech firms like Uber, AirBnB, LivingSocial, and Rovio. All of those items likely made Braintree an enticing buy for PayPal(and something that it wouldn't want competitors to snap up). PayPalsays it expects to handle $20 billion in mobile payments this year, and that Venmo will 'help to contribute' to its mobile payments prowess. 'The consumer side and the merchant side have to come together for the next generation of e-commerce,' Ready told us when Venmo Touch launched. 'Payments will become a network effect play about who can make it easiest for merchants and consumers to connect with one another with context-driven experiences. To do that, you need to have thousands of merchants and millions of consumers. We are thinking that this platform, if we do this right, will be as important for next decade of commerce as PayPalwas for the last decade.' Founded in 2007, Chicago-based Braintree raised $69 million in funding from investors including New Enterprise Associates, Accel Partners, RRE Ventures, and Greycroft Partners. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c10000024c3\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c10000024c3</url>[7]<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c1001acc0d1\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c1001acc0d1</url>[8]<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/521983e1843bac676e0003a2\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/521983e1843bac676e0003a2</url>[9]<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130926005611/en/eBay-Acquire-Global-Payments-Innovator-Braintree\">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130926005611/en/eBay-Acquire-Global-Payments-Innovator-Braintree</url> [2]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.braintree.com\">http://www.braintree.com</url> [3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/why-weve-agreed-to-acquire-braintree/\">https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/why-weve-agreed-to-acquire-braintree/</url> [4]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/03/braintree-now-processing-10b-in-payments-with-deeper-expansion-into-europe/\">http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/03/braintree-now-processing-10b-in-payments-with-deeper-expansion-into-europe/</url> [5]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/04/braintree-publicly-launches-venmo-touch-to-be-as-important-for-next-decade-of-commerce-as-paypal-was-for-last/\">http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/04/braintree-publicly-launches-venmo-touch-to-be-as-important-for-next-decade-of-commerce-as-paypal-was-for-last/</url> [6]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/16/venmo-braintree/\">http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/16/venmo-braintree/</url> [7]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c10000024c3\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c10000024c3</url> [8]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c1001acc0d1\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/3e122f809e597c1001acc0d1</url> [9]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/521983e1843bac676e0003a2\">http://www.vbprofiles.com/widget/company/521983e1843bac676e0003a2</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VNTR10798813802047487607618061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59FD-8D51-JCMN-Y2YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><timeReceived>2:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>September 26, 2013 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002E8X</classCode><className>EBAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000D0GK</classCode><className>LIVINGSOCIAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0003FO6</classCode><className>ACCEL MANAGEMENT CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009YUK</classCode><className>RRE VENTURES LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS454112 ELECTRONIC AUCTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

EBay's biggest troll is announcing[4] \"a fresh batch of too-good-to-be-true deals that will drop if Amazon crashes.\" Meaning, eBay's sale will roll out additional deals if Amazon crashes again this year. But eBay isn't the only retailer stepping up to compete with Amazon in July \u2014 Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom are holding sales, too. </p><p>This confluence of major online retailer sales is turning mid-July into a summer Cyber Monday. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. EBay[6] has announced a \"Crash Sale\" to rival Amazon's Prime Day[7], with the promise of extra deals if Amazon[8] crashes again like last year. Amazon crashed for over an hour[9] at the beginning of its 2018 Prime Day: error messages appeared on web pages, and customers encountered issues with placing items in their carts. Despite this, Amazon had record sales of $4.2 billion in the 36 hours of Prime Day, according to Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst Michael Pachter[10]. This was the company's highest single sales day until Cyber Monday[11] a few months later in November 2018. Read more: Amazon Prime Day, the made-up holiday that rivals Black Friday, is coming soon. Here's why it's such a big deal.[12] The eBay Crash Sale will run on July 15, overlapping with the first day of Amazon's now 48-hour[13] Prime Day. EBay's biggest troll is announcing[14] \"a fresh batch of too-good-to-be-true deals that will drop if Amazon crashes.\" Meaning, eBay's sale will roll out additional deals if, and only if, Amazon has a similar outage to last year. EBay is also positioning itself as competitive to Amazon Prime in its free shipping, no membership, and \"best price guarantee\" that ensures that shoppers who find their eBay Deal item being sold at a competitor for a lower price within 48 hours of their purchase will be paid 110% of the price difference back by eBay. But eBay isn't the only retailer stepping up to compete with Amazon in July. Nordstrom's annual anniversary sale begins early access for members on July 12 and public access on July 19. Walmart[15] will be running sales July 14 through 17, and Target's Deal Days is the exact timeframe of Prime Day. This confluence of major online retailer sales is turning mid-July into a summer Cyber Monday. \"July has become a massive shopping season,\" said eBay COO Jay Hanson in the Crash Sale press

'He says people should make money. I said, Let them make money\u2014but why do you want to make money off the poor people?'</p><p> \u2014 The New Yorker[1] This week, India's newly-elected ultranationalist leader <person><nameText>Narendra Modi </nameText></person>unveiled his cabinet, three-quarters[2] of whom come from a fascist [3]paramilitary outfit, the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) \u2014 including one minister accused by police last year of inciting deadly Hindu-Muslim violence that left over 50 dead. The RSS was founded in 1925 by open admirers[4] of Mussolini and Hitler; in 1948, an RSS member[5] assassinated pacifist Mahatma Gandhi. In 1992, it was the RSS that organized[6] the destruction of the Ayodha Mosque, leaving 2000 dead[7], mostly Muslims; and in 2002, the RSS played a key role in the mass-murders of minority Muslims in Gujarat, according to Human Rights Watch[8], when the state of Gujarat was ruled by <person><nameText>Narendra Modi </nameText></person>\u2014 himself a product of the RSS[9]. Earlier this week, Pando reported[10] that Modi's election received help from unlikely sources in Silicon Valley including Google, and to a much more serious extent, Omidyar Network[11], the philanthropy fund of eBay billionaire and First Look publisher <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar. </nameText></person>From 2009 through February of this year, Omidyar NetworkIndia Advisers was headed[12] by Jayant Sinha[13], a longtime Modi adviser and newly-elected\u00a0MP[14] in Modi's ultranationalist BJP party[15] ticket. The Omidyar Networkpartner and managing director played a double role, investing funds in Indian nonprofits and for-profits, some with distinctly political agendas; while privately, the Omidyar man 'worked in Modi's team'[16] in 2012-13, and served as director[17] in the ultranationalist BJP party's main think tank on security and economic policy, the India Foundation. This week, Modi\u00a0appointed\u00a0the head\u00a0of the India Foundation[18], former intelligence chief Ajit Doval[19], as his\u00a0National Security Advisor[20]. Modi was the 'hi-tech populist' [21]candidate: London techies[22] managed Modi's 3-D hologram[23] campaign, beaming 10-feet-tall Modi holograms to rallies across India. And India's techies played a key role both in campaigning for Modi and voting for Modi. Despite the sunny progressive Silicon Valley gloss we've been fed these past few decades, Modi's appeal shows that the tech industry is as prone to far-right authoritarian politics as any other industry. And that is what makes the Omidyar Networkstory so revealing: Perhaps no other figure\u00a0embodies the disconnect between his\u00a0progressive anti-state image, and his\u00a0factual collaboration with the American national security state and the global neoliberal agenda, than <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar. </nameText></person>The role of Omidyar Networkin so many major events of the past week \u2014 helping elect India's ultranationalist leader <person><nameText>Narendra Modi; </nameText></person>co-funding Ukraine regime-change NGOs[24] with USAID, resulting in a deadly civil war and Monday's election of Ukrainian billionaire oligarch[25] Petro Poroshenko; and now, this week's first-ever sit-down TV interview with Edward Snowden, through an arrangement[26] between NBC News and <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar's </nameText></person>First Look Media \u2014 shows how these contradictions are coming to the fore, and shaping our world. Omidyar's central role in the US national security state's global agenda may still come as a shock to outsiders and fans of First Look media's roster of once-independent journalists. But to White House foreign policy hawks, <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar </nameText></person>represents the new face of an old imperial tradition. Liberal Hawks: Samantha Power, Omidyar USAID 'For Washington, NGOs are nothing less than 'America's invisible sector' of influence.' \u2014James Peck, Ideal Illusions[27] In November 2013, UN Ambassador and neocon favorite\u00a0[28]Samantha Power\u00a0gave a speech at the\u00a0Freedom Award[29]\u00a0ceremony, honoring George Soros' role in advancing America's foreign policy strategy through the Open Society-USAID private-public partnership. The Freedom Award is one of the Cold War[30]\u00a0establishment's top honors; past honorees[31] include George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Winston Churchill, and OSS spy agency founder 'Wild' Bill Donovan. This is Soros' second Freedom Award, and for good reason, as Ambassador Power explained[32]: Soros' vision for the world \u2014 a world of free markets and 'open government' \u2014 perfectly synched[33] with President Obama's vision: A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of listening from the gallery of the United Nations General Assembly when President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>addressed the heads of state of the world and built an entire affirmative agenda around Karl Popper's vision, which is George's vision and which George popularized and resourced: open economy, open government, open society. After noting that 'private donations now equal more than two-thirds of the amount that the U.S. government gives in foreign aid,' Ambassador Power praised Soros' contributions and\u00a0singled out\u00a0his Silicon Valley heir, Intercept publisher <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar[</nameText></person>34]: The new philanthropists\u2014the Soros-modeled philanthropists \u2014 donate money, but they do so while they're still in the prime of their lives\u2026 And through his example, George [Soros] has given definition to what it means to be a modern philanthropist, to be a doer, paving the way for Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffet, Pam and <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar, </nameText></person>and others. George was first. Samantha Power\u00a0would know: In November 2010, while serving in Obama's National Security Council[35], she\u00a0posted on the White House website[36] a glowing description of President Obama's meeting with an Omidyar-funded Indian NGO, Janaagraha, just one month after the organization received a $3 million grant[37] from Omidyar Networkto launch its iPaidABribe anti-corruption campaign. The $3 million grant was Omidyar's first to an Indian NGO under managing director Jayant Sinha - who, as Pando reported, had a second job as advisor to ultranationalist <person><nameText>Narendra Modi. </nameText></person>Curiously, before receiving Omidyar's money and Obama's personal blessing, the NGO's co-founder, Ramesh Ramanathran[38], expressed his support for Obama's counter-insurgency strategy[39] in Afghanistan. With one caveat: even more NGOs: \u2026for all its celebration of local services, the counter-insurgency strategy doesn't go far enough to realize the full potential of this approach. Specifically, two key aspects need to be added: first, having local governments be at the centre of civic service improvements; and second, well-defined participatory decision-making processes that empower citizens. \u2026In other words, counter-insurgency could be thought of as 'bottom-up nation-building', not just asymmetric war strategy. Ramanathran[40] is a former Citibank executive and a Yale MBA. Besides fighting corruption in India through his NGO, Ramanathran also runs a microfinance company[41] that targets India's urban poor[42] borrowers \u2014 'maids, vegetable sellers, security guards' according to one description[43]. His microfinance company suffered early on from high default rates[44] and alleged underworld pressures, but has since expanded lately thanks to large private equity investors like Morgan Stanley [45]and KKR. By taking a closer look at Omidyar Network's investments in India, we gain insight into where the common interests between Big Tech, the US national security state, and neoliberalism align \u2014 and Omidyar's strategic thinking aligning\u00a0eBay/PayPal with Omidyar Networkand First Look media. Let's start with Omidyar Network's investments in the\u00a0Rural Development Institute, founded by one of the godfathers of American counterinsurgency strategy: Roy Prosterman. 'Property Rights': Omidyar and 'Phoenix Program' guru Roy Prosterman Omidyar Networkidentifies 'property rights'[46] (or 'property titling') as one of its five areas of focus. One of Omidyar's personal heroes and largest grant recipients is neoliberal economist Hernando de Soto, the former right-hand[47] man to jailed dictator[48] Alberto Fujimori[49]. De Soto is the world's leading peddler of 'property titling' as the answer to global poverty: rather than giving aid, De Soto says we should give the world's poor private property titles, which slum dwellers can presumably collateralize into microloans for their slum-based startups. The results[50] have often been catastrophic[51] \u2014 but that hasn't stopped De Soto from being admired by the world's ruling elite, ranging from Bill Clinton[52], to the Koch brothers[53] \u2014 to <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar, </nameText></person>who gave $5 million[54] to De Soto's neoliberal think tank[55], and gushes on Twitter[56]: Brilliant dinner with Hernando de Soto. Property rights underlie and enable everything. \u2014 <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar </nameText></person>(@pierre) September 23, 2009[57] India, like many developing countries around the world, has what Anglo-Americans consider a weak legal structure on property rights. In particular, local indigenous peoples lay ancient claims to lands they live on, and have resisted state attempts to forcibly evict them to make way for industry, mining, and other powerful interests. The Naxal Maoist insurgencies raging in parts of India are fueled in part by displaced, landless peoples. Since Modi's election landslide, global investors[58] have been hopeful that India's land will now be made easier to buy and sell. Omidyar Network's longtime top man in India, Jayant Sinha\u2014now an MP in Modi's far-right ruling party \u2014 told CNBC[59] that Modi's first job should be making land acquisition easier: We have to start with land acquisition. We have to make land acquisition a lot better in terms of both the people that are acquiring the land from the farmer's and so on as well as for industry. So perhaps it's little surprise that Omidyar's first major India grant[60], in 2008, went to the Rural Development Institute's (renamed 'Landesa') program 'to help secure land rights for the rural poor' in India's Andhra Pradesh state. By 2009, Omidyar Networkhad committed $9 million[61] to the RDI land rights program, the largest grant in the outfit's history. And what a history: The Rural Development Institute was founded in 1967 by Roy Prosterman, whose land reform programs were a key element[62] in the Vietnam War counterinsurgency strategy, the\u00a0'Phoenix' assassination program[63]. The Phoenix program became the template for modern American counterinsurgency[64] \u2014 violent terror, combined with soft-power land 'reforms' cooked up by Prosterman's Institute. During the Vietnam War, Prosterman teamed up with USAID[65] to implement his 'land-to-the-tillers' reforms, granting land to peasants as the carrot, while at the same time CIA death squads assassinated tens of thousands of Vietnamese village leaders and terrorized restive regions into submission. The result, Prosterman later boasted, was that Viet Cong recruitment dropped 80 percent[66]. A decade later, Prosterman sold the same land reform program to\u00a0El Salvador's junta[67], just as the junta was ramping up its deadly attacks on rural civilians that left 75,000\u00a0killed[68]\u00a0by US-backed government forces. Prosterman also served as 'land reform' advisor to Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos[69].\u00a0And in the 1990s, Prosterman was contracted by Booz Allen to advise land reforms in Moldova, according to journalist Tim Shorrock[70]. Former Wall Street Lawyer Works to Defend Poorest Farmers in China | Lovely tribute to Roy Prosterman @Landesa_Global[71] <url normalizedValue=\"http://t.co/PMcCCD2b\">http://t.co/PMcCCD2b</url>[72] \u2014 Omidyar Network(@OmidyarNetwork) October 25, 2012[73] A few years ago, Prosterman's Rural Development Institute changed its name to Landesa. But Prosterman's Cold War outfit hasn't changed its close cooperation with USAID[74], or its core strategic mission, tying land ownership to security (and counterinsurgency) \u2014 neatly summed by Landesa's India director's article: 'Connecting the Dots Between Security and Land Rights in India.'[75] Leaving aside the alleged benefits to India's poor of giving them land title to the commons \u2014 400,000,000 Indians live on less than $1.25 a day [76]\u2014 for the more powerful interests funding land titling programs,\u00a0there are endless advantages. It helps create a mass tax base for governments that want to shift more taxes onto the masses; it formalizes and legalizes transfer of property from the commons to the strongest and richest; it makes foreign investors happy; it helps the government and businesses track and keep data on its citizens; and, to quote Omidyar Networkmanaging partner Matt Bannick \u2014 recently appointed by the Obama White House[77] to a special taskforce \u2014 Prosterman's land reforms made Omidyar[78] 'excited about how micro-land ownership can empower women and help them to pull themselves out of poverty.' That's because micro-land ownership helps create the real\u00a0focus of Omidyar Networkinvestments in India: Microfinance. 'Financial Inclusion': Omidyar, Microfinance Suicide-By-Pesticide Omidyar Network's ugliest disaster \u2014 besides co-funding Ukraine regime-change groups with USAID \u2014 was its role in funding SKS Microfinance, whose predatory lending and debt collecting practices led to a rash of gruesome suicides in rural Andhra Pradesh. First, a quick word on the theory and practice of microlending. In theory, the original microfinance concept \u2014 a nonprofit extending micro-loans to the poor, under favorable terms, below market rates \u2014 could be beneficial, and under the right circumstances, it often was. But to the neoliberals, the original microfinance\u00a0concept smacked of do-gooder state socialism \u2014 so microfinance floundered in the margins of the development community until 1992. That year,\u00a0USAID commercialized a Bolivian microfinance nonprofit called Prodem, creating a new\u00a0for-profit micro-lender, BancoSol in its place. BancoSol ballooned overnight \u2014 both in loans and in profits, making millionaires of the former nonprofit directors before BancoSol nearly collapsed at the end of the decade. USAID liked the for-profit neoliberal model for microfinance, and it persuaded the World Bank and other global financial institutions to load in and sing its praises. That brought microfinance to the attention of Wall Street funds, eventually pushing out 'old' 'unsustainable' nonprofit microfinance institutions, and seducing the likes of Nobel Peace Prize winner and microfinance industry guru Muhammad Yunus into the for-profit[79] sector as well. As we now know, it ended in disaster[80] \u2014 particularly in India's Andhar Pradesh[81] state, where Omidyar-funded land title programs had been busy creating legions of rural poor 'micro-land owners' now ready to load up on Omidyar-funded microfinance loans. The result would be scores of women driven to grisly suicides[82], forced prostitution, and despair. It's hard to overstate just how central the for-profit microfinance model is to <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar's </nameText></person>'vision.' In a 2006 New Yorker article detailing Omidyar's near-religious zeal for commercializing microfinance, we learn that the eBay billionaire not only rejected the Nobel Peace Prize winner's appeals to soften his monomaniac focus on profiting off the world's poor \u2014 we also learn that Omidyar was committed to wiping out whatever remained of charitable non-profit microlending, so as not to 'distort the market.' Omidyar rejected on principle entreaties from his fellow billionaires to invest in a nonprofit microfinance fund. Because on principle, Omidyar refused to believe that good could come from anything but the self-interested profit motive. Here's the New Yorker[83]: [Omidyar] often cites Adam Smith's doctrine that unrestrained market forces and self-interest drive the most efficient\u2014and socially beneficial\u2014use of resources. Omidyar sees Smith's principles at work in eBay; he believes that eBay's commercial success was linked to a profound social good. Omidyar's faith in the eBay model is so great that he is convinced that it can be applied to solving humanity's problems, including\u00a0poverty \u2014 and that is why Omidyar singled out\u00a0for-profit microfinance as his life's mission. After rejecting Yunus as an 'old thinker' wedded to old do-gooderism non-profit thinking, Omidyar announced a $100 million donation to Tufts University, the largest in school history, with the stipulation that the Omidyar-Tufts Microfinance Fund[84] went 'specifically' into 'investments that would promote microfinance's commercialization.' To manage the fund, Omidyar hired a Senior Credit Officer from USAID \u2014 the agency that originally commercialized microfinance in 1992 \u2014 who channeled Joseph Schumpeter to\u00a0the New Yorker[85]: 'One of the things we need and we will get is a cycle of creative destruction,' said Tryfan Evans, the director of investments at the Omidyar-Tufts fund, who previously worked at U.S.A.I.D. 'If you're inefficient, you will get overtaken by competitors.' What is rather shocking in hindsight is how fanatical Omidyar's faith is in the free market, to the point that he's willing to risk exploiting the most vulnerable poor on earth to prove that Adam Smith is right. The dangers of for-profit microfinance lending to India's poor were no secret: the\u00a0New Yorker article[86] references a\u00a0string of microfinance related suicides[87] in Andhra Pradesh back in 2006, before Omidyar's millions pour oil on that fire. Yunus failed to dissuade Omidyar: 'Let them make money\u2014but why do you want to make money off the poor people?' To Omidyar's mind, Yunus just didn't get it. This was about something far more important\u2014 Omidyar was\u00a0proving a theory. To\u00a0the New Yorker reporter, the eBay billionaire explained: 'Omidyar views the fund as a way of testing his theories about commercializing the sector. 'It's really the demonstration impact I'm looking for, primarily,' he said.' And so Omidyar tested his theory: plowing millions into India's SKS Microfinance via investments into murky microfinance outfit Unitus. In 2010, SKS Microfinance listed a $350 million IPO[88] that netted insiders and early investors like Unitus obscene profits. The murky, interlocking nonprofit/for-profit[89] structures ensured that only those on the inside knew whether Omidyar made money on his investment. The only sure thing was that the explosion of microfinance lending in the state of Andrah Pradesh, led by SKS Microfinance, wound up saddling the world's poorest and most vulnerable village women with debts they could not pay, causing a wave of suicides. An AP investigation[90] directly implicated Omidyar-funded SKS Microfinance agents in several suicides: One woman drank pesticide and died a day after an SKS loan agent told her to prostitute her daughters to pay off her debt. She had been given 150,000 rupees ($3,000) in loans but only made 600 rupees ($12) a week. Another SKS debt collector told a delinquent borrower to drown herself in a pond if she wanted her loan waived. The next day, she did. She left behind four children. One agent blocked a woman from bringing her young son, weak with diarrhea, to the hospital, demanding payment first. Other borrowers, who could not get any new loans until she paid, told her that if she wanted to die, they would bring her pesticide. An SKS staff member was there when she drank the poison. She survived. An 18-year-old girl, pressured until she handed over 150 rupees ($3) - meant for a school examination fee - also drank pesticide. She left a suicide note: 'Work hard and earn money. Do not take loans.' In all these cases, the report commissioned by SKS concluded that the company's staff was either directly or indirectly responsible. After the report, Omidyar Networkscrubbed SKS Microfinance from its website. An old cached webpage[91] shows Omidyar hailing SKS Microfinance for 'serving the rural poor in India' and claiming that the murky Unitus private equity fund's IPO 'exit strategy' will 'attract more capital to the market.' Instead, Unitus dissolved its microfinance NGO, a wave of resignations and murky millions moved hands, SKS Microfinance became a pariah, and Andhra Pradesh passed laws regulating microfinance institutions. A tiny handful of insiders and investors pocketed obscene millions, over 200 killed themselves, and entire Indian rural communities were devastated. Self-interest and profit motive did not create the greatest social good that Omidyar believed in; and yet, Omidyar Networkcontinues to expand its portfolio[92] of microfinance \u2014 or 'financial inclusion' \u2014 investments. eBay Shrugged 'Omidyar stopped talking about microfinance as a way to end world poverty, and instead described its mission in a way congruent with the eBay experience.' \u2014New Yorker The key to understanding the enigmatic eBay billionaire and his many contradictions \u2014 an active participant in Washington's global empire on a scale unrivaled in publishing, while also founder of a quarter-billion dollar 'adversarial journalism' startup and privatizer of the Snowden NSA files, the largest cache of leaked national security secrets in US history \u2014 is understanding Omidyar's eBay-centric vision. Omidyar is a vision man[93], as his star employee Jeremy Scahill[94] constantly reminds us. And his vision was shaped, for understandable reasons, by his experience making ten billion dollars overnight off of eBay, which Omidyar believes is proof of a larger philosophical and moral structure at work, rather than a combination of smarts, luck, privilege\u2026 and other less savory factors. In 2000, Omidyar confided to his New York Times biographer, Adam Cohen, that he founded eBay to create a 'perfect market' after feeling cheated by the way tech IPOs in the early 1990s let insiders 'spin' IPOs for a quick profits before dumping them onto the market to regular investors \u2014 like the pre-eBayOmidyar. Cohen writes[95]: When 3DO announced plans to go public in May 1993, Omidyar placed an order for stock through his Charles Schwab brokerage account\u2026. 3DO went public at $15 a share, but when Omidyar checked his account, he learned that the stock had soared 50 percent before his order had been filled\u2026. it struck him that this was not how a free market was supposed to operate\u2014favored buyers paying one price, and ordinary people getting the same stock moments later at a sizeable markup. Omidyar's solution was an online auction. Cohen, a member of the New York Times editorial board, found Omidyar's story convincing. There was only one problem: At the very time Omidyar spun this yarn to Cohen, Omidyar was under investigation[96] in the largest IPO stock spinning scandal in history. According to a House investigation, in return for giving Goldman Sachs the lucrative eBay IPO, the 'vampire squid'[97] bank\u00a0set up private secret accounts for Omidyar and CEO Meg Whitman letting them spin dozens of tech IPOs before they went to market \u2014 ripping off both retail investors and startup investors. Omidyar settled a shareholder fraud lawsuit[98] in 2005 without admitting wrongdoing, ironic for a visionary who believes so deeply in accountability. More recently, Omidyar was subpoenaed[99] by a\u00a0federal grand jury[100] criminal investigation[101] into\u00a0his and other eBay executives' alleged roles in stealing Craigslist's 'secret sauce'[102] for eBay's profit. As grubby as Omidyar's might sound, it is in perfect keeping with his radical free-market ideology, an ideology that prioritizes self-interest[103] and the profit motive as the greatest engines for good in the world. Of course, the real Omidyar has little in common with the Omidyar of journalistic fairytales \u2014 the 'civic minded billionaire' and 'the billionaire exception' (Columbia Journalism Review[104]), whose 'commitment to the investigative form and an open society\u00a0' is so great, we 'should pray he lives a long and lucid life' (Reuters[105]) \u2014 or, the Omidyar that Pulitizer Prize winner Glenn Greenwald described to Amy Goodman[106]: '\u2026if you look at Pierre's record of advocacy over the last several years\u2026.He would not start a new business in order to make money. He would only start a new business for some goal, some civic-minded goal.' Actually, the real Omidyar would never, on principle, start a new business, or pursue a civic-minded goal, without putting profit at the very center of the project. On principle \u2014 because in Omidyar's mind, no good could possibly come from defying the free markets. That is why he fought with Yunus over the principle of getting rich of the world's poorest people through microfinance. As the New Yorker explained it: 'EBay would be his template for the future. In 2004, he founded Omidyar Network, which makes for-profit investments as well as philanthropic donations, and as he began to search for vehicles with eBay-like properties he decided that microfinance was an amazing fit. Both eBay and microfinance allow people to discover that they can be entrepreneurs\u2026. Both can be viewed as demonstrations of free-market principles. Both can be seen as businesses whose profitability is linked to their social impact. Omidyar stopped talking about microfinance as a way to end world poverty, and instead described its mission in a way congruent with the eBay experience.' It is impossible for us\u00a0non-billionaires to grasp how profoundly Omidyar Network's 'philanthropy' is shaped by eBay/PayPal's corporate interests: his enthusiasm for microfinance to the world's poor is shaped by eBay, and even First Look media \u2014 which structurally[107] resembles Omidyar Network's murky profit/nonprofit pretzel \u2014 is turning out to be an eBay-vision-in-progress[108]. As with Omidyar's vision for self-supported microfinance as the best means for 'social impact,' Omidyar has made it clear he wants First Look to be 'self-supported' from the profits of First Look's 'technology company' that will 'develop new media tools for First Look properties.' Ebay \u2014 which gives people 'tools to pursue their goals,'[109] and whose 'vast scale' demonstrates 'business could also be an effective tool for social good' \u2014 is the model for Omidyar Network's philanthropy; and finally, the circle is closing as eBay transforms itself into a 'digital magazine of all things,' according to a former Omidyar[110] employee writing in the Atlantic[111]: eBay is hiring editors and long-form writers to help turn its site into a 'digital magazine,' according to president of eBay Marketplaces\u00a0Devin Wenig[112]\u2026. He wants eBay to be a retail-publisher, not a social network. 'We're now in the content business,' Wenig said. 'So, for the first time, eBay has a voice. We're telling stories. We have an editor. We have curators. And we have writers on-staff. You'll see that evolve to some longer-form stories, some really beautiful pictures\u2026 It's media-like.' Viewed through Omidyar's own lens, and through Omidyar's\u00a0own words, the contradictions between the White House insider-Omidyar who works hand in glove with the national security state, and maverick publisher-Omidyar pledging to fight the national security state, aren't really contradictions. Because there is always one right answer whenever those two interests collide, one synthesis to that alleged dialectic: The interest of the shareholders is always right. Omidyar himself explained[113], in his own words, his eBaysian vision\u00a0in the case of WikiLeaks, when he chose the self-interest of eBay/PayPal[114]'s shareholders \u2014 Omidyar being the number one shareholder \u2014 over everything, including the principle of protecting free speech and resisting government repression of WikiLeaks. In his PayPal-WikiLeaks editorial, Omidyar wrote[115]: Today, it appears, notification of a criminal investigation is enough to force businesses whose cause is not the First Amendment to cut off a publisher the way Amazon, PayPal, Visa and Mastercard each have done WikiLeaks. (Disclosure: Civil Beat Publisher <person><nameText>Pierre Omidyar </nameText></person>is chairman of eBay, which owns PayPal.) Unlike the press barons of old, the executives of these businesses cannot tell their shareholders that it will hurt their company more to cave on a matter of principle than to drop a customer. It is their right and common practice to shut a customer down when they receive complaints from criminal investigators, even without a court order. This even though the existence of a criminal investigation is no indication of guilt. The executives have a fiduciary duty to do what's best for their shareholders. And if they didn't respond to government warnings, they very well could risk their own business being shut down. There is no doubt, and no difference between the Omidyar who argued with Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunnus about the need to profit off the world's poorest borrowers; or the Omidyar who pursued the self-interest of eBay's shareholders over less valuable principles like freedom of expression; or the Omidyar who chooses to collaborate with USAID in Ukraine, or violent ultranationalists in India whose policies could help eBay's bottom line. The contradictions exist only in the minds of those who hope and dream of a different Omidyar, an Omidyar of liberal fairytales.<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/30/061030fa_fact1?currentPage=all\">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/30/061030fa_fact1?currentPage=all</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/05/27/uk-india-politics-hindu-idINKBN0E70R020140527\">http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/05/27/uk-india-politics-hindu-idINKBN0E70R020140527</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://scrible.com/s/40CS0\">http://scrible.com/s/40CS0</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/13/international/asia/13HIND.html?action=clickmodule=Searchregion=searchResultsmabReward=relbias%3Asurl=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry420%23%2Fr.s.s.%2Bfascist%2Bindia%2F\">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/13/international/asia/13HIND.html?action=clickmodule=Searchregion=searchResultsmabReward=relbias%3Asurl=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry420%23%2Fr.s.s.%2Bfascist%2Bindia%2F</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/magazine/the-other-face-of-fanaticism.html?action=clickmodule=Searchregion=searchResultsmabReward=relbias%3Asurl=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry959%23%2FGodse+r.s.s\">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/magazine/the-other-face-of-fanaticism.html?action=clickmodule=Searchregion=searchResultsmabReward=relbias%3Asurl=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry959%23%2FGodse+r.s.s</url>.

The two companies announced they would leave the association Friday afternoon, as did eBay, Stripe, and Latin American payments company Mercado Pago. They join PayPal which exited the group a week ago[2], as global regulators continue to air concerns about the project[3]. The latest exodus leaves the Libra Association without any remaining major payments companies as members, meaning it can no longer count on a global player to help consumers turn their currency into Libra and facilitate transactions. </p><p>The remaining association members, including Lyft and Vodafone, consist mainly of venture capital, telecommunications, blockchain and technology companies, as well as nonprofit groups. 'Visa has decided not to join the Libra Association at this time,' the company said in a statement. 'We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.' Facebook's head of the project, former PayPal executive David Marcus, cautioned on Twitter against 'reading the fate of Libra into this update,' although he acknowledged 'it's not great news in the short term.' Libra will press ahead with plans to formally charter the association in three days despite the setbacks, Dante Disparte, its head of policy and communication, said in a statement. 'We are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world's leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,' he said. 'Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.' Facebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other Libra Association members. Almost immediately afterwards, the project faced relentless scrutiny from global regulators, who said it raised a host of serious questions that the group had yet to answer. France and Germany last month pledged to block Libra[4] from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead. And U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the project could not advance before addressing serious privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability concerns that must be addressed. The rapid succession of exits by major financial companies Friday afternoon suggested that scrutiny was taking its toll. Three days earlier, a pair of senior Democratic senators wrote to Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe, telling them to be wary of 'a project that will forseeably fuel the growth in global criminal activity.' 'If you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all activities,' Senator Sherrod Brown and fellow Democratic Senator Brian Schatz wrote in the letters. Brown said in a statement after the announcements on Friday that the companies had been 'wise to avoid legitimizing Facebook's private, global currency.' Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to discuss the project when he testifies before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on October 23. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the panel, has repeatedly called on Facebook to shelve the project.

In a brief welcome word, EBF CEO Wim Mijs emphasised the need for European reinforcement in the fintech space.  </p><p><br/>[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]  <br/>Good evening ladies &amp; gentlemen,  <br/>Welcome in Amsterdam, welcome to the EBF Fintech Cocktail.  <br/>My name is Wim Mijs and I am the CEO of the European Banking Federation.  <br/>Many of you already know what the EBF does. But for those who don\u2019t;  <br/>The EBF represents the interests of the European banking sector, trying to keep financial regulation fresh, efficient and above all: We need regulation that is future-proof.  <br/>We do this from Brussels, where most EU policy &amp; regulation is being produced and many EU institutions are seated. And Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank and the centre of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Euro system.  <br/>The technology revolution makes our work really exciting, because not only business is undergoing enormous change, the regulatory mindset is also shifting. This year alone, Europe gave birth to two major rules, PSD2 and GDPR.  <br/>And this is only the beginning, policy makers and regulators are finally sinking their teeth into technology and acknowledging the importance of the financial sector to innovate and grow.  <br/>In March, the European Commission came up with the European Fintech Action Plan. I like the word Action in this context. Because that is exactly what we need, with an overclock speed.  <br/>In the Action Plan there is a clear focus on strengthening cybersecurity and technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence have got their own observatories. The European Central Bank has made its guidelines for new bank licenses and the European Banking Authority is assessing closely the interactions between fintech activity and national regulators in its Fintech Roadmap. But we need more than just observation.  <br/>Time for action indeed. We are a long-time supporter of an EU-wide framework of experimentation, also know as a fintech sandbox. This will not only benefit the market knowledge of authorities but eventually accelerate the cross-border nature of fintech business cases.  <br/>But fintech as we see it, is not the first innovation that is disrupting the world of money and certainly not the last. This time though, the speed of it all is incredible.  <br/>What we really are talking about here, at Money 2020 during the Amsterdam Fintech Week, is banking technology.  <br/>And also, we are within a stone\u2019s throw, a few hundred meters in that direction, from the very first public stock exchange in the world, where traders gathered to sell their stocks of the East India Company.<br/> Due diligence was done from door to door. Compliance was handwritten and required several pair of eyes. Transparency and trust were as important back then as they are now.  <br/>The tools of the trade just look a bit different.  <br/>There was no MiFiD 2 back then, but financial activity never was unregulated. Rules were increased every time someone tried out a trick and changed when it did not work. Tricks that still tend to happen, leading to losses and even crises.  <br/>It all has led to the current rules that are in place. Rules that will always require thorough review, by government and by the market.  <br/>Now regulation needs to be applicable in the digital age. Since banks will not the only ones doing banking.  <br/>Big tech and big data companies are emerging and leaving their marks in many industries, even in our social doings. Data awareness is growing, GPDR is a good start.  <br/>But when playing the same game, you stick to the same rules. The sector needs competition, banks even like competition. But it must be fair. Banks exchange data with third parties, but not the other way around.  <br/>Neither finance was a one man\u2019s job, there was always a need to broaden horizons, looking at new ways of working together, merging, consolidating.  <br/>It is what led to the capital markets and banking unions of this world. It is what is happening between banks and start-ups. The models of collaboration are endless.  <br/>Are you wondering how the bank of the future looks like? Ask yourself how the human behind that bank will look like. Because it also makes sense to think about the people interacting with financial services; employees, consumers, clients. They are the ones feeling the impact, they have to make the decisions in a complex environment. That\u2019s why education, financial literacy and consumer protection has become more so important in the digital age and cannot be ignored. That\u2019s why it has become part of our work as well.  <br/>In a politically challenged Europe, the need to strengthen the single market is crucial to stay ahead.  <br/>And as we all know, technology is a big part of the answer.  <br/>Digitally driven and cross-border financial services are essential to keep up trade and economic growth.  <br/>While accelerating the digital transformation, we should continue to pursue true European goals, because the world around us has not stopped to move forward.  <br/>Let\u2019s do this together.

The second out of four workshops under the European Committee for Standardization\u2019s (CEN) rules will be hosted by UNESCO in its Paris headquarters on Tuesday 5 February.</p><p>The Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) aims at creating a mechanism to reward media outlets for providing guarantees regarding transparency, verification and correction methods, editorial independence and compliance with ethical norms.</p><p>Launched by the EBU together with RSF, AFP and GEN, the initiative is pursuing a self-regulatory and voluntary, though authoritative process.</p><p>At the upcoming meeting in Paris on Tuesday (Feb 5), the group of stakeholders, composed of around 120 representatives of media outlets, regulatory authorities, tech companies, academia and international organizations, will discuss first drafts of indicators to identify trustworthy journalism and thus, guide both human and algorithmic decision making in news distribution and consumption.</p><p>Three so-called drafting committees and an advisory technical task-force gathered for preparatory meetings already on Monday (Feb 4). Standardization framework is key</p><p>\u201cWhilst many start-ups and initiatives are launching a variety of ranking and rating schemes for the media, it is essential that a universally accepted and inclusive ranking and rating scheme be developed and supported by the big players in the media world, such as Public Service Media organisations and commercial allies,\u201d said EBU Director General Noel Curran.</p><p>\u201cThe scheme needs to be tested, scalable and trusted by online platforms and the public. That\u2019s why we prefer the path of standardization under CEN guidelines.\u201d</p><p>Noel suggested that a set of standards, once published, could then pave the way for numerous non-for-profit and commercial actors to build audit and enforcement schemes around them. Accordingly, some of them, like NewsGuard and the Global Disinformation Index, have recently joined JTI to explore synergies of the ongoing efforts.</p><p>\u201cWe have an opportunity for a breakthrough here in providing reliable and trusted news more prominently to the public and making it easier for them to find it. In an age of fake news and misinformation that is a goal EBU Members are committed to.\u201d</p><p>The missing link</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science to define the basic journalistic principles: many ethical codes exist as long as journalism exists,\u201d claimed Christophe Deloire, RSF\u2019s Secretary General.</p><p>As a major problem he mentioned the algorithmic distribution of online content, because it does not include an \u201cintegrity factor\u201d and amplifies everything that goes against these professional norms \u2013 sensationalism, rumours, falsehoods and hate.</p><p>Therefore existing best practices of the journalistic trade need to be translated to code of the Internet. This is a condition to reverse its logic, according to Deloire, by rewarding and eventually re-monetizing compliance with these norms.</p><p>\u201cJTI is the missing link between journalistic principles and methods on one side, and algorithms on the other,\u201d he added.</p><p>Sorted into the three different drafting committees, the project is currently develop machine-readable criteria for media outlets, big and small, in the domains of identity and ownership, journalistic methods and ethics. Journalists in charge</p><p>\u201cWe understand that there is a substantial demand for these indicators, on the side of major platforms, advertisers, but also regulators and the media sector itself,\u201d explained Bertrand Pecquerie, GEN\u2019s CEO.</p><p>But according to him, the process of developing them must be fully self-regulatory.</p><p>\u201cWe do not want to see governments or regulators or advertisers or big tech telling us what good or bad journalism is and therefore it must be us, the journalist\u2019s community, to take the lead!,\u201d he said.</p><p>For this reason, the JTI\u2019s drafting committees are composed of industry professionals only, representing major media outlets like AFP, AP and dpa, the BBC, TV 5 Monde and France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision, RTL Group, Gazeta Wyborcza, Tagesspiegel or Tamedia, as well as professional organizations and NGOs like the EBU or the Ethical Journalism Network.</p><p>Other stakeholders, which are not part of the drafting committees, include Facebook and Google, Internews, the International Press Institute, the Thomson Foundation, the Worldwide Web Consortium, the French regulatory authority CSA, IMPRESS and IPSO from Britain and the German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. Responsiveness matters</p><p>\u201cIt is critical to answer properly to the public distrust in media, by offering to the citizens landmarks and visible tags on the web to distinguish trustworthy content easily,\u201d emphasized Phil Chetwynd, AFP\u2019s Global News Director.</p><p>\u201cFor us as a news agency, workability of the solution in the daily routine is key and it is extremely important, for all of us working on JTI, to propose a solution that serves the interests of the citizens first and foremost.\u201d He mentioned the public consultation stage as one critical element in drawing up a standard under CEN guidelines, but also the plan to test and evaluate the final results.</p><p>\u201cAny standard is subject to constant review, particularly in fast-moving industries, and we expect this one to be no exception,\u201d Chetwynd added, \u201cbut we have to start somewhere and we have to do it now.\u201d 'Promoting an enabling environment\u201d</p><p>UNESCO\u2019s Assistant Director-General for Communication and Information, Moez Chakchouk, re-affirmed the organization\u2019s commitment to strengthening quality journalism across the globe. On the occasion of hosting the second JTI workshop at its Paris headquarters he declared: \u201cWe are supporting the sustainability of independent journalism, by fostering enabling environments for press freedom, in particular promoting transparency and compliance with professional standards.\u201d</p><p>After the Paris meetings on 4 and 5 February, another two workshops are planned including a public consultation phase. The results of the JTI will be published as a CEN Workshop Agreement at the end of 2019. The project ist hosted by the French and German standardization bodies Afnor and DIN on behalf of the European Committee for Standardization, CEN.</p><p>JTI is funded through voluntary contributions of its key stakeholders RSF, EBU and AFP, and through a grant provided by the French Ministry of Culture (Fonds de soutien \u00e0 l'\u00e9mergence et \u00e0 l\u2019innovation dans la presse)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1450879I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6S-X481-F0YC-N28H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The ECB board member also pointed out that the company behind the planned virtual currency, Facebook, is currently subject to scrutiny by legislative bodies both in the US and in the EU over its mishandling of users' personal data, something which has allegedly posed \"threat\" to Western democracies.</p><p>The ECB official said that he hopes European users won't be \"tempted\" by the \"treacherous promises of Facebook's siren call\", but would instead stick with the \"safety and soundness of established payment solutions\".</p><p>Facebook announced in 2019 that its virtual cryptocurrency, the Libra, would be launched in early 2020 as a means to give access to \"basic financial services\" to those users who currently lack them in their own countries. The currency, which would be run by Facebook along with 28 partners, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, and Spotify, is expected to be used for money transfers, as well as purchases.</p><p>However, the company's\u00a0initiative has been met with criticism\u00a0in the US, with the Congressional House Financial Services Committee reportedly drafting a bill called the \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act\" to prevent technological giants from becoming financial service brokers. The US Congress also suspects Facebook of mishandling its users' private data, which has allegedly been used to manipulate elections in the country. The company is facing similar scrutiny in several European nations.</p><p>Sputnik</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/8/156743741167.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/8/156743741167.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-153006510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYJ-1KN1-JDJN-62X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

'Either it Works or it Doesn't' At the recent G7 Summit in France, the board member, economist Benoit Coeure, remarked that until all of the countries there were satisfied with how Libra involves or doesn't involve everything from money laundering to economic stability, it will be prevented from launching. He used the words 'prolonged discussion' to describe this regulatory threat.Expounding on why exactly regulators are taking such an approach, Coeure notes that for something as important as a new payment system that will be accessible by over two billion individuals in most of the world's countries, everything needs to be 'safe, robust, and resilient from day one'.Indeed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned that Libra[2] \u2014 and cryptocurrencies in general \u2014 can be used in illicit activities, like the financing of terrorism, the sale of drugs and other contraband, and tax evasion. </p><p>'Either it works or it doesn't,' the ECB representative further quipped, boiling Libra down to binary.Also, Coeure notes that since cryptocurrencies are a new topic on the global stage, there are inconsistencies and gaps in how nations address the asset class, implying that the eight-odd months from here to Libra's planned launch may not be enough time for regulators.Coeure didn't address how exactly regulators would prevent Libra's launch, but there have been rumors of a draft bill that would prevent Silicon Valley companies from making forays into financial services.Per previous reports from Blockonomi[3], a leaked bill titled 'Keep Bitcoin Tech Out of Finance Act[4]' would ban big names in technology from 'establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset' that is meant to fulfill the three fundamental tenets of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.Also, an individual like the American President could theoretically sign an executive order that could prevent Facebook from moving ahead with the development of Libra and its wallet, Calibra. Seeing that Trump has tweeted about Libra's potential violation of the Banking Charter, this is not as far fetched as it may initially sound. The President tweeted two weeks back:Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International. Let it Grow While it has been clear that some of the most powerful men and women on Earth are against Libra's launch, it is important to note that Libra has some allies, albeit relatively few.The head of Germany's central bank, Jens Weidman, told a group at the G7 conference that should Libra be released in the state that was outlined in the white paper, the end result may be 'attractive to consumers'. He adds that it may be unwise to suppress innovation before true issues have arisen.Also, U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry, who representsNorth Carolina's 10th District, remarked that Bitcoin and the ecosystem that surrounds it is an 'unstoppable force'. Speaking to Congress and CNBC's 'Squawk Box' panel, the politician urged his peers to not try and 'deter this innovation', as 'those that already have tried have already failed.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Financial technology has existed for practically as long as the financial services industry itself. The telegraph and the transatlantic cable laid in 1866 to connect North America and Europe is a clear example. That technology provided the infrastructure for the first era of major financial globalisation in the late 19th century.[1] And innovations such as the automated teller machine (ATM), credit cards, electronic payments and internet banking have each changed the face of modern banking.</p><p><br/><br/>But now we are entering the next phase of the digital age, when the combination of new telecommunications, big data analytics, cryptography and machine learning technologies has the potential to change the whole banking industry in faster and more disruptive ways than ever before.<br/><br/>As technology gives new entrants better and cheaper ways to compete for core banking business, banks' dominant position could be challenged. And indeed, we are already seeing disruptions in the financial services market:<br/><br/>In the first half of 2018, global investment in fintech reached $ 57.9 billion across 875 deals, a significant increase from the $ 38.1 billion invested in the whole of 2017.[2]<br/><br/>The time span for adopting various banking innovations, such as online or mobile banking, is getting shorter and shorter.<br/><br/>Many consumers are switching to e-commerce, and more e-retail payments are made from mobile phones. Consumers expect pan-European services that are safe, efficient and easy to use. With the recent launch of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), the Eurosystem has laid the groundwork for innovative, customer-friendly retail payment solutions that benefit everyone in Europe. TIPS is a truly domestic market infrastructure for pan-European instant payments with settlement in central bank money within 10 seconds and a price fixed at 0.20 eurocent.[3]<br/><br/>Technological investment in cash cycles is also strong and helping to make this safe, instant and cheap means of payment resilient. Indeed, on average, cash payments take just over 22 seconds and cost around 24 cent per transaction according to a recent study of retail sector cash payments in Germany.[4]<br/><br/>Fintechs could make the financial system more diverse and competitive, offering customers better-targeted, faster and cheaper financial services. But fintech could also lead to the emergence of new risks and greater concentration.<br/><br/>So far, regulators have tolerated or even facilitated these developments. In the EU, for instance, the revision of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) aims to foster innovation and enhance competition by requiring banks to share account information.<br/><br/>But to the extent that fintechs are providing core banking services, regulators and central bankers need to monitor their activities in order to follow risk migration.<br/><br/>Fintech credit: lending in transition<br/><br/>Fintechs have now moved into core banking services, including the credit business.<br/><br/>Currently, fintech credit makes up only a very small fraction of overall credit, but it is growing rapidly and could become more dominant in certain market segments. In the United States, for example, 36% of unsecured personal lending was issued by fintechs in 2017.[5]<br/><br/>'Fintech' is often associated with small start-ups - technologically innovative firms with agile business models. But huge, globally active technology companies, the so-called big tech companies, are also entering the market. These companies have a competitive advantage because they can leverage their existing customer networks and huge amounts of proprietary data to provide financial services. Moreover, their enormous balance sheets give them the financial capacity to handle credit risks economically on a large scale.<br/><br/>These comparative advantages of big tech could, in principle, generate benefits for customers. By using predictive algorithms, machine learning and a wider range of data, available from online spending or social media, for example, big tech could become more efficient at lending than traditional banks.<br/><br/>Moreover, if big tech can speed up loan application processing, reduce transaction costs and improve credit risk assessments, it could increase the overall degree of competition in credit markets.<br/><br/>And with their increasing market share, these companies could help diversify the sources of credit to the economy, thus fostering investment and growth.<br/><br/>However, these big tech companies are generally less motivated by the return on their credit activity and more by the access they get to data that let them sell products and services over and above their financial activities.<br/><br/>Therefore we can't rule out some negative side effects. Not only could large technology companies increase market concentration by exploiting their network externalities, they could also create new risks.[6]<br/><br/>For example, risks could arise from big tech's funding models, which often use a mix of internal and external investors to finance loans or repackage and sell them to third-party investors. Such originate-to-distribute models can lead to information asymmetries, incentive problems and financial instability - as we painfully learned from the mortgage lending that led to the subprime crisis.<br/><br/>Another type of fintech is the so-called peer-to-peer lender, which offers credit services in a fundamentally different way to banks in that the services are unbundled. Electronic platforms typically match borrowers and investors without taking on balance sheet risks and generate fee revenue rather than net interest.<br/><br/>Technological innovation may enable lending platforms to become more efficient and more targeted in terms of how they intermediate between borrowers and lenders and thus put pressure on incumbent banks. Still, I would argue that, until lending platforms can replicate the benefits of intermediation, they will not meaningfully challenge the role of banks in the economy. I see two main reasons for this:<br/><br/>Lending platforms are unable to perform liquidity transformation on a significant scale - that is, to provide short-term liquidity services for depositors and long-term loans for borrowers.<br/><br/>Lending platforms are less resilient during shocks, being more prone to funding freezes and swings in credit risk appetite than banks, as at this stage they are small and not diversified.[7] Also, banks have both insured deposits, which contain depositor runs, and higher levels of capital, which supports lending during downturns.<br/><br/>For these reasons, lending platforms are currently unlikely to threaten banks' market position in lending. Still, these developments should be continuously monitored.<br/><br/>Fintechs are changing the payments landscape<br/><br/>Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market, where firms have expanded their presence in non-capital intensive business such as cross-border transfers, micropayments and card payments because those are the areas where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products.<br/><br/>This is affecting the payments landscape. In a European Banking Authority survey, a majority of incumbent banks indicated that payments is the business area most affected by fintech competition, eroding fees and commission income.[8]<br/><br/>In response, many banks have begun to adjust their strategies by investing more in technology and partnering up with fintechs.<br/><br/>The emerging competition is welcome and may bring lasting social benefits to customers in terms of efficiency gains, increased choice and more resilient payment systems.<br/><br/>But our role is to ensure not only efficiency, but also safety. As a central banker with the statutory task of ensuring the smooth functioning of payment systems my view is that we also need to carefully observe how this disruptive process unfolds. We should be mindful that risks could accumulate in the unregulated sector, which could affect payment security.<br/><br/>Customers' interests need to be taken into account. This includes consumer protection and prudential requirements to defend customer funds. But these concerns must not be confused with pretexts to secure vested interest and inhibit innovation.<br/><br/>Likewise, although it is desirable to have strong domestic European payment providers, not the least to be less exposed to extraterritorial jurisdiction, we should not use protectionist measures to shield incumbents from market pressures. On the contrary, we should remain open to global players to foster competition. In fact, the industry itself should address the obstacles hampering the emergence of European players.<br/><br/>Scenarios for the future<br/><br/>As the competition between fintechs and incumbent banks unfolds, the financial system could become more diverse and competitive. But it could also become more concentrated, and new risks to financial stability could emerge.<br/><br/>Two extreme scenarios for the future are possible. Both come with regulatory implications.<br/><br/>In the first one, banks rise to the digital challenge by upgrading their technological systems and teaming up with fintechs. There are signs of this happening, as global banks' IT expenses rose to $ 250 billion in 2017, from $ 180 billion in 2013.[9]<br/><br/>In this scenario, banks leverage technology to enhance their products, services and operations, allowing them to retain their customer relationships and core banking services. Risks to financial stability would be rather low, as financial services provision would remain largely subject to the existing prudential regime.<br/><br/>In the second scenario, banks fail to provide the digital financial services demanded by customers. New, innovative and fast-moving fintechs, or big tech firms with large customer networks, would come to dominate the market - with all the risks that I outlined.<br/><br/>Obviously, reality is much more complex than this binary distinction of extreme scenarios. And the range of business models of big or small banks, re-prioritization and mutualisation of certain services cannot be captured by such simplifying templates.<br/><br/>Indeed, some traditional banking services could move to less-regulated parts of the financial system. But pre-emptively drawing in the reins in the name of financial stability could harm innovation and prevent fintechs from growing.<br/><br/>We certainly must continue monitoring developments closely and adjust regulation when and where needed to ensure that financial services remain safe and sound.<br/><br/>But competition - to refer to the Austrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek - is a discovery procedure[10], and it is up to the markets' verdict which product or service is the optimal solution. Legislation and regulation should therefore ensure a level playing field for all market players, incumbent's and new entrants alike.<br/><br/>[1]See Arner, D., Barberis, J. and Buckley, R.

Subscribers will see stories like this every day on our website (and in our daily emails) as an added value to your subscription.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Have we reached a market top in technology stocks and, in particular, those of the Fangs: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google? That is the question many investors are asking, not only because their valuations seem so high but also because it seems Big Tech has become the new Wall Street and the prime target for a populist backlash in a world increasingly bifurcated, economically and socially.</p><p>When Donald Trump tweets about Amazon avoiding sales tax (incorrectly, not that it has ever stopped the US president), the trend shows that it has reached critical mass. Meanwhile, the industry generates its own terrible PR: see the most recent complaints from numerous women about sexual harassment by tech investors.</p><p>What is most interesting is that Silicon Valley remains in a cognitive bubble, reluctant to engage with legitimate public worries over monopoly, privacy and tech-related job disruption, not to mention its own culture.</p><p>When I ask most techies about these concerns, reactions tend to range from defensive to naive to clueless: \"Politicians don't understand the Valley\", or \"Universal basic income will make work irrelevant\" or, worst of all, the patronising smile or exasperated look that says: \"You're not a tech insider, and thus you just don't get it.\"</p><p>It all seems too familiar. I am old enough to have lived through one big boom-and-bust tech cycle. Indeed, I worked for a high-tech incubator in London from 1999 to 2000, when venture capitalists would hire journalists to scout \"pan-European B-to-C media deals\", a sign of froth in the market if there ever was one.</p><p>Levels of hubris today are similar but, more pernicious, given that the largest technology companies have become the systemically important institutions of our day. Like the big Wall Street banks, they hold vast amounts of money and political power and even greater troves of data. Facebook has more users than China has people. Yet unlike Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief executive, they are not joking when they say they are doing God's work.</p><p>Silicon Valley operates more or less exclusively on the notion that it is making the world more free and open, despite growing concerns that social media has eroded democracy and predatory algorithms are targeting the weak and vulnerable, in the same way that pre-crisis predatory lending did.</p><p>The Valley has clearly moved away from its hippy, entrepreneurial roots. Big Tech chief executives are as rapaciously capitalist as any financier, but often with an added libertarian bent in which anything and everything - government, politics, civic society, and law - can and should be disrupted.</p><p>\"Demos - society itself - is often viewed as being 'in the way',\" says Jonathan Taplin, a professor at the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab in California, and the author of Move Fast and Break Things, which tracks the evolution of the Silicon Valley political economy.</p><p>Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and noted Big Tech critic, cites a telling example of this attitude. \"I once had a conversation with a Silicon Valley consultant about search neutrality [the idea that search engine titans should not be able to favour their own content]. And he said, 'We can't code for that.' I said this was a legal matter, not a technical one. But he just repeated, with a touch of condescension: 'Yes, but we can't code for it, so it can't be done.' The debate would be held on the technologist's terms, or not at all.\"</p><p>All this reminds me of the cognitive bubble that financiers were in before (and in many cases after) 2008. Like the tech industry today, finance did a good job of using its money and political power to hold the debate over reform hostage to its own interests. Policy conversations were made as complicated as possible to keep \"insiders\" in control, even though the simple questions - is the financial system helping the real economy and society or not? - were often the best and most important.</p><p>Cognitive capture of decision makers was rife because financiers and regulators lived and worked in the same echo chamber. Many bankers I knew seemed befuddled about why people were so angry with them. No wonder - they had never met any ordinary people before.</p><p>All this is true when it comes to Big Tech today. \"Silicon Valley talks mainly to itself,\" says Vivek Wadhwa, a software entrepreneur and fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. \"It's all about connections here, and nobody wants to take on the big issues for fear of offending someone important.\"</p><p>Indeed, too many attempts at public \"engagement\" just end up making Silicon Valley executives seem more, rather than less, out of touch (think not only of Uber's epic mistakes, but also of more subtle examples such as Mark Zuckerberg's rambling, 6,000 word letter addressing the topic of fake news).</p><p>The public worries about the economic and social effects of technology, and those worries are not going away. Some investors are even baking them into the valuations.</p><p>\"Big Tech and Silicon Valley have been among the most politically insulated sectors in the S&amp;P 500, while financials and energy have been among the most closely scrutinised. Investors would be well-advised to think about how these roles may reverse in the current administration,\" read a note from Strategas Research put out last week. Fang executives should take heed.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Platforms such as Facebook have all too often argued they are not publishers, absenting themselves from responsibility for the content on their sites, despite their major influence on society. A ruling from Europe\u2019s highest court calling for Facebook and similar companies to adopt more proactive filtering might seem overdue. Yet it is filled with grey areas. Clarification is needed to stop it becoming a serious, if accidental, impediment to free speech.</p><p>The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by an Austrian politician in 2016. She argued that a user\u2019s defamatory comments about her on Facebook should be removed, along with any similar messages posted by others, globally. Austria\u2019s top court asked the European Court of Justice to interpret the ecommerce directive, which does not require tech groups to monitor all content on their platforms, and exempts companies from direct legal responsibility for user-uploaded material.</p><p>The ECJ found that national courts that deemed content illegal could order Facebook and others to search for and delete identical or \u201cequivalent\u201d content, worldwide. For those who have watched social media become a tool in the hands of extremists of all stripes, this may feel like a victory. The many video uploads of the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand are just one example of the material that has flourished on online platforms.</p><p>As it stands, however, the ruling of the ECJ is deeply flawed. When removing offending content, the court says platforms may use automated filtering systems to help them. This technology is expensive to create and operate, advantaging well-heeled Big Tech companies. The definition of \u201cequivalent\u201d is also vague. Given the increasing pressure from regulators, platforms are likely to interpret the word more broadly than they might have before.</p><p>Previous laws, such as Germany\u2019s regulations against misinformation and hate speech online, have shown that using automated filtering to weed out harmful content creates problems with more nuanced points, such as satire for example. The ruling could be exploited by European populist governments where rule of law is weakening: courts there could demand that critical content be removed worldwide.</p><p>The ruling says global content takedowns will have to take place in accordance with international laws. But it is unclear whether, for example, the US will respect EU rulings on hate speech. The decision also contradicts last week\u2019s ECJ ruling on the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d, which stated that the EU\u2019s laws end at its borders. Attempting to impose the bloc\u2019s will worldwide may encourage other states to assert policy transnationally. </p><p>The decision has implications for the EU\u2019s upcoming Digital Services Act, which will establish the responsibility social media companies should take for user content. The act offers a chance for the EU to get things right. It should follow the precedent of the right to be forgotten ruling and set geographic limits. The act\u2019s wording should also be clarified to avoid leaving it up to platforms to decide the meaning and scope of \u201cequivalent\u201d.</p><p>Politicians around the world are flexing their muscles. The leaked comments this week of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who vowed to fight any attempts by the US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren to break up the company, highlight the anxiety over the gathering political backlash.

Seventy years ago it was a malaria-ridden port; now it is an important regional centre for banking and finance, and the top earner for foreign exchange in Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wealthy and their private bankers love its low taxes, while its political stability, infrastructure and lack of street crime attract multinationals and tourists alike. Its strong private financing ecosystem \"\" the city is awash with private equity capital \"\" has funded a host of fintech startups, transforming a few, most notably Grab, into pan-regional powerhouses.</p><p>Yet there is one thing the city can't get right. However hard it tries, it cannot seem to inject any life into its primary equity markets. In 2018, a total of just 16 initial public offerings were completed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), raising $1.54 billion, according to data from Dealogic. Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, India and China each completed more IPOs and raised more capital than Singapore.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loh Boon Chye, SGX</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>It was bad enough that Singapore's main board saw less primary activity in 2018 than in any year since the global financial crisis. But it was equally humbling for the SGX to see its long-standing rival, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx), tot up 202 initial stock sales and raise $36.7 billion in total.Dealogic data show that in terms of pure volume, the SGX accounts for 3.73% of all completed Asian IPOs since the start of the decade; for the HKEx, the figure is over 30%.Not only that, companies are actually fleeing the SGX, rather than embracing it. Over the last five years, delistings have outnumbered listings, a reflection of the low valuations for many of the listed companies and the availability of private funding, which makes it easier to take such companies private.The number of companies registered on the SGX fell to 741 at the end of 2018, from a peak of 782 in 2010. In 2018, 24 companies delisted from the main board, including shipbuilder Vard Holdings, which was taken private by its Italian parent Fincantieri, taking with them $19.2 billion in market value.SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye has lofty ambitions for the exchange he runs.\"We want to become the preferred fundraising destination for corporates, not just from Singapore and southeast Asia, but from around the world,\" he tells Asiamoney. \"What I hope will happen eventually is that any organization, corporate or financial institution, when it thinks about accessing, investing in and raising capital in Asia, they think of us first. Asia equals SGX.\" What I hope will happen is that any organization, when it thinks about accessing, investing in and raising capital in Asia, they think of us first. Asia equals SGX\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Loh Boon Chye, SGX For now, that goal feels distant, and even unrealistic. Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city's financial regulator, admits that in terms of attracting primary listings, the city is lagging.\"The public equities market is one area of financial services where we are not as strong as we would like to be,\" he admits. \"Clearly, when it comes to primary issuance, Hong Kong is way ahead of Singapore.\"That raises three questions: first, why does the SGX struggle to attract listing candidates, be they small or big, tech or non-tech, privately owned or state-run? Second, is there a solution to the problem? And finally, if the answer to that question is no, does it really matter?    Local listingsSingapore's struggles in this regard are not new. Unlike Hong Kong, it does not have a big, wealthy patron \"\" China \"\" that supplies most of its business.A handful of mainland Chinese firms, particularly in technology, choose to sell shares in New York. But most are attracted to one of three bourses \"\" Shenzhen and Shanghai onshore and, semi-offshore, Hong Kong. Look at the mainland names that lit up Hong Kong's IPO market in 2018: infrastructure firm China Tower (which raised $7.5 billion); smartphone maker Xiaomi ($5.4 billion); and food delivery company Meituan Dianping ($4.2 billion).There was a time when Singapore won a smattering of China listings. In the 2000s, dozens of so-called S-chips made the Lion City their home. But that crashed to a halt following a series of high-profile scandals and corporate governance issues.After being burned a second time in the penny-stock crash of 2013, when Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corporation, three firms linked by common boards and executives, lost S$8 billion ($5.76 billion) in just three days of trading, many of the city's retail investors stayed away from the market for good.Most assumed the wider region would take up the slack, with the SGX attracting companies from southeast Asia. That didn't happen either, as most firms opted to stay loyal to their home markets. Instead, the SGX has been overtaken by its own backyard peers.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Martin Siah, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>In 2018, companies raised $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion on Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Thailand respectively. Since 2010, Singapore has had fewer new stock listings than Bangkok, Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur.\"Southeast Asia is becoming more localised in terms of where listings happen,\" says Laksono Widodo, director of trading at the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in Jakarta. \"We need more stocks and better regulation, but we are continuing to improve our basic infrastructure. I see the IDX becoming the largest stock exchange in the region over the next five to seven years.\"Which leaves only Singapore as a source of fresh meat for the SGX, and while there is clearly no lack of potential listing candidates \"\" the city-state is abuzz with young firms swimming in money, particularly in fintech \"\" the challenge is to convince them of the appeal of a local flotation. That is easier said than done.\"There is a virtuous circle, where more IPOs mean more liquidity, and we haven't quite got into that cycle yet,\" admits MAS chief Menon.\"The SGX has been trying to break out of this cycle for three years,\" a local equities banker adds. \"They've changed leadership, changed origination teams, consulted with banks and lawyers and industry consultants, but there is no easy answer.\"When we meet in July, a Singapore-born investment banker points out that the last non-property IPO took place on the main board two years earlier, when recruitment firm HRnetGroup raised $122 million.\"In the last 18 months, the main listing hall has been used only four times for big-board listings,\" he says. \"I've been hauled in front of the MAS and asked: \"~Why are there no IPOs?' I tell them why, and they nod their heads. You can't create primary activity by magic.\"Of course there are some listings. Real estate investment trusts (Reits) in particular can't get enough of the place.ARA US Hospitality Trust's $498 million IPO in May this year was followed two weeks later by Eagle Hospitality Trust's $677 million sale. In July, Prime US Reit, which owns property in nine North American cities, joined the party, raising $813 million from its offering. That pushed the amount raised on the SGX in the first seven months of 2019 to $1.56 billion, passing last year's total.Chief executive Loh hails the SGX's \"reputation as Asia's largest international Reit platform\", and pointed to this year's trio of stock sales, which \"added to the depth and breadth of our Reits sector\".At the end of 2018, the bourse was home to 42 Reits and property trusts, with a combined market capitalization of $65 billion, making it the largest market of its kind in Asia outside Japan.In terms of property trusts, \"nowhere competes with Singapore\", says Martin Siah, head of Asia Pacific real estate, gaming and leisure, and head of southeast Asia, global corporate and investment banking, at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.The market is so large and mature it is even followed by M&amp;A bankers. In October 2018, Viva Industrial Trust and ESR-Reit combined to form a single vehicle worth $1.87 billion, while in April, OUE Hospitality Trust and OUE Commercial Reit announced plans for what would be Singapore's biggest merger.  Active marketThere's a reason this market is so active. Reits offer bond-like features that typically bear higher yields than you would expect from fixed income. Add to the mix a stable operating climate and the city's status as Asia's leading centre for wealth, with private banks overseeing more than $2 trillion in assets, and the result is an environment that is catnip for property investors.The five locally listed US Reits represent an average distribution yield of 7.4% in 2019, and 7.6% in 2020.But could property be the SGX's undoing?\"Wealth loves Reits,\" notes a local investment banker. \"The big shift here over the past eight years has been from institutional wealth to private wealth. Family offices are hugely influential \"\" these are the guys who put down $20 million, $50 million, when a Reit comes to market. But of course, wealth doesn't invest in equities.\"After all, why take the risk when these yields are so attractive.And therein lies a large part of the problem. When unlisted companies sell equity, in an ideal world they target a healthy mix of institutional and retail wealth. Singapore has a shortage of both. Too many retail investors were burned by S-chip and penny-stock scandals and never returned. There is no Singaporean version of Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire whose mere presence in an IPO is enough to bring out punters in droves.But a bigger problem is Singapore's paucity of cornerstone investors. They aren't always welcome or indeed ideal \"\" in Hong Kong, they can skew the balance of sales. That was evident in September 2016, when Postal Savings Bank of China raised $7.4 billion from an IPO that was three-quarters covered by cornerstones, mostly state-run enterprises. Yet they do offer smaller investors the hope that the sale will fly and that everyone will pocket a profit.Singapore lacks its own clique of cornerstones. The cash-rich Chinese state firms that often underpin Hong Kong IPOs are absent from local sales. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Lavanya Chari, Deutsche Bank</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Nor does it have handy home-grown replacements. Yes, there's the Central Provident Fund, and the twin sovereign wealth funds, Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC). Each plays a different role. The CPF helps local Singaporeans plan for retirement, while the other two invest in a mix of local and foreign assets.But for different reasons, none of them invests in active IPOs (though both GIC and Temasek can, and do, put their cash to work in enterprises before they are listed). When asked why, bankers scratch their heads.\"If the authorities want to give a boost to stock offerings, all they need to do is talk to GIC,\" says one. \"Get them involved, and I guarantee you the man on the street would consider buying shares. Whenever the regulator asks, that is the answer I give.\"For Singapore's authorities, the biggest source of frustration has been the fruitless battle to convince local fintechs to make the SGX their home.The regulator has long been \"great at spotting good fintechs and creating an environment conducive to them surviving and thriving,\" says Lavanya Chari, head of global products and solutions at Deutsche Bank Singapore.But when they choose a listing destination, it's often one as far away as possible.\"In respect of public listings, many growth companies tend to choose other listing venues, and Singapore's performance there has not been so sparkling,\" says MAS chief Menon.In October 2017, gaming and e-commerce company Sea raised $884 million from its listing on the New York Stock Exchange. A month later, Razer Inc, a gaming hardware firm, made its debut on the HKEx after raising $528 million. [Singapore is] great at spotting good fintechs and creating an environment conducive to them surviving and thriving\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Lavanya Chari, Deutsche Bank The two companies were Singapore-born-and-bred, and saw their shares jump on debut: Sea by 8% and Razer by 18%.Razer's decision to bypass the SGX and make a beeline for the HKEx was keenly felt.\"It was our flagship success story,\" says a local ECM banker. \"It was founded by a local guy; its headquarters are still here. It was a pity.\"That the firm was partly funded by capital from GIC made it even more hurtful.Yet is it so hard to understand the decision, made by Tan Min-Liang, Razer's Singapore-born co-founder, chief executive and creative director?Boosted by backing from Li Ka-shing, the public portion of Razer's offering was 290 times oversubscribed. Compare that with this year's Singapore IPO by Eagle Hospitality Trust, which sold less than half of the securities in the retail portion of its sale, forcing bookrunners and underwriters to pick up the slack. At the debut on the SGX main board, its units slid 6% and, at the end of August, were still trading below their IPO price of 78 cents. Fresh bloodWhat the authorities want and need is for a big, unlisted name to embrace the SGX. \"It will certainly help if we have one or two big unicorns listed here,\" says MAS managing director Menon. \"[The] SGX is actively talking with growth companies, asking them what they need to consider a primary listing here. If we can get one or two big name listings here, that will create the momentum and improve the liquidity and more firms will list here.\"All eyes will be on Singapore-based Grab, the region's leading ride-hailing company, which was valued at $14 billion in March. Seeing Grab's ticker on its main board would not only be a fillip to the bourse, but would also add some much-needed fresh blood to its gene pool. Banking makes up 40% of the benchmark Straits Times Index, with property and telecoms accounting for 23%.It's not as though the authorities have turned a blind eye to the problem. In January, MAS unveiled a S$75 million grant that encourages young firms to list on the Singapore Exchange by defraying some of their listing costs.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ravi Menon, Monetary Authority</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">of Singapore</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SGX chief Loh points to co-listing partnerships with Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, forged with the aim of giving local firms a chance to tap fresh sources of foreign capital.</p><p>Like most ambitious bourses, the SGX never seems to sit still. Its \u00a387 million ($107 million) takeover of London's Baltic Exchange in 2016 provided it with a \"springboard into London and the rest of Europe,\" Loh says. \"Prior to the acquisition, we were a team of six in London; now we have over 40 people in the UK and Europe working with customers and industry partners.\"</p><p>It has introduced dual-class shares that give some company owners superior voting rights. It has also diversified into derivatives (Morningstar reckons the exchange earned more from futures and options than from cash equities in 2018) and has bought or invested in several fintechs, including London trading platform BidFX, and Freightos, an online international freight market place based in Hong Kong.</p><p>In June 2018, the SGX announced its biggest shake-up in years. It merged its fixed income, currencies and commodities business into one unit, hiring Lee Beng Hong, a former China head of institutional clients at Deutsche Bank, to run it, and amalgamated its cash equities and equity derivatives operations.</p><p>It also created a new unit spanning global sales and origination, whose priority, says Loh, \"is to expand our international footprint\", notably in London and the US.</p><p>Some say Singapore doesn't need a stock market buzzing with new activity. After all, the city is financially stable and flooded with private wealth, a good portion of which washes into thriving young firms. Loh expects private funding markets to continue to grow \"as corporations and institutional investors seek additional investment opportunities outside of public markets\".</p><p>But listings matter, and always will. They offer attractive exit options for private equity and venture capital funds. Without them, stock exchanges look less appealing, and the longer Singapore struggles to convince even its own best young firms to sell shares to the public at home, the harder it will get.</p><p>Loh knows this all too well.</p><p>\"It's important that companies see SGX as a capital continuum; raising capital via debt and equity as well as in private and public markets,\" he admits. \"We are a key market for corporates raising equity and debt, and for fintechs seeking to raise funding from venture capital and private equity firms. After listing, companies also need to continually raise funds. Secondary fundraising at SGX is usually multiple times our primary fundraisings.\"</p><p>It's one thing to admit the problem, quite another to solve it. As hard as the exchange tries to, in Loh's words, be the \"preferred fundraising destination\" for companies from \"around the world\", it still has not found the solution.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1hb60xw71td20</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-R7G1-F0GS-H23F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In the US, Amazon has stepped up to the health care challenge with CEO, Jeff Bezos, holding parleys with the Director General of the WHO to \"flatten the curve\" and make sure Amazon can \"protect people around the world\".</p><p>In 2007, in her book, 'Shock Doctrine', Naomi Klein argued that history is a chronicle of \"shocks\" - the shocks of wars, natural disasters, and economic crises, but more importantly, of their aftermath characterised by disaster capitalism, calculated, free-market \"solutions\" to crises that exploit and exacerbate existing inequalities. This is why Big-Tech-to-the-rescue in times of the virus does not strike the right chord. It started with the lockdown order issued by the central government on March 24 with the exemption for essential services and supplies getting extended to delivery of foods, pharma products and medical equipment through e-commerce channels. The upper classes had to be assured that their means of shopping would not be affected. Notably, the order issued no such explicit exemption on the movement of foodgrains through Food Corporation of India channels, integral to the Public Distribution System. The lockdown order was a candid admission that e-commerce companies have now become infrastructural utilities indispensable to India's aspirational middle class.</p><p>Dominant e-commerce platforms have seized this moment to position themselves as interlocutors of public interest. In the US, Amazon has stepped up to the health care challenge with CEO, Jeff Bezos, holding parleys with the Director General of the WHO to \"flatten the curve\" and make sure Amazon can \"protect people around the world\". China's Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba, sent out shipments of a million masks and 500,000 coronavirus test kits to \"friends in America\". Pledging his solidarity to the global community, Ma wrote, \"It would be irresponsible of us to sit on the fence, panic, ignore facts or fail to act.\" The new global digital Czars holding sway over the market it would seem are the charmed circle, displacing aggressive diplomacy and nationalistic propaganda.</p><p>On March 27, after the lock-down announcement and ensuing shutdown of delivery and logistics operations on the ground, Indian e-commerce companies met the Minister of Commerce and Industry seeking an expedited channel for trucks, also submitting that differentiation of essential versus non-essential items by the government may ignore what consumers 'wanted'. Even prior to the lockdown, Flipkart had extended a hand to the government, offering to partner in any programme for the delivery of essential commodities.</p><p>This zeal that e-commerce platforms have displayed is disaster capitalism's COVID-19 moment. The pot at the end of the rainbow must be claimed now, and the traditional retail sector - grocers, pushcart vendors, neighborhood traders who paradoxically have been catering to the public in these strange and trying times - rendered irrelevant. The aftermath in a post-COVID world could easily present e-commerce a phenomenal opportunity. Zomato, the food delivery platform, is making forays into grocery and is about to launch Zomato Market. With its food delivery fleet grounded, the company is in talks with Grofers and Big Basket facing a spike in grocery orders, to optimise labour supply. Big ecommerce platforms have already coopted local stores into their logistics and supply chain. In fact, the offline is the crucial battleground for the big players in online retail - Amazon, Flipkart and JioMart - as each of them woos local kirana stores to scale up last mile reach.</p><p>The long game</p><p>What is presented as a win-win for both big e-tail and small stores is in fact a skewed equation. Today, kirana stores already subsidise e-commerce big business in delivery of goods, stocking and inventory management. The end game for JioMart, Amazon and Flipkart is to eventually push their grocery and private label business through these local stores. Flipkart and Amazon are also trying aggressively to push their payment wallets PhonePe and AmazonPay, while Reliance Retail has already launched the Jio point of sale (PoS) machine for kirana store vendors so that it can gain a firm hold over its distribution segment. The last mile player will still be around, only to be reduced to a replaceable cog in the corporate wheel.</p><p>Social distancing measures and fears of the contagion have led to consumers rapidly switching to e-commerce from brick-and-mortal retail. Surveys of the Indian market indicate that hyperlocal e-tailing businesses (such as grocery) registered a 45-50% growth in overall gross merchandise volume in the first two weeks of March, when compared to the same period in February. At the height of the COVID-19 crisis, Alibaba-backed online grocery start-up BigBasket acquired the milk delivery start-up DailyNinja, gaining control over the latter's network of 1,10,000 consumers and 2000 milkman partners across the country. A time when most public transport networks and warehousing and logistics infrastructure have come to a grinding halt and open retail markets are shut down happens to be BigBasket's moment to consolidate its hold over microlocal retail networks.</p><p>The future is evidently online in more ways than one. When the crisis passes, it can never be a return to business-as-usual. On March 20, the Retailers Association of India petitioned the government seeking urgent economic stimulus for traditional retail on grounds of decreasing footfalls and loss of revenues, highlighting that COVID-19 has exacerbated the financial stresses on the sector. The lockdown is only going to worsen the cash flow crunch and big and small retailers alike may end up simply shutting shop. And those who remain will find themselves in a radically altered market scenario - a 'new retail' sector where online and offline retail channels are seamlessly integrated and controlled by e-commerce companies. Wholesalers, distributors and kirana stores may have no option but to integrate into some part of the warehousing, supply and micro-retail logistics network of one of the big e-commerce platform companies. Morgan Stanley has predicted that even with the recession, e-commerce is expected to bounce back. Gaining resilience post-COVID will call for greater coordination and predictability in supply chains in a highly resource-constrained economy. The prowess to achieve economies of scale in this context - in terms of sophisticated AI, robotics, IoT - is the exclusive monopoly only of the e-commerce giants. Retail is poised to see a second digital disruption, a new normal with significantly higher concentration of market power.</p><p>The longer-term prognosis of this is worrisome. E-commerce platforms dream big. Their cash burn models are built to embrace cross-sectoral ventures. In 2018, Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack and established its ambitions in health care. This partly explains Bezos' public-spirited motivation during this crisis. Governments fighting jobless growth and recession may simply have to give in to these corporatised, new age public utilities, allowing them to lead the way. For India, this poses several critical policy concerns. What will be the fate of the draft e-commerce policy? How are 'FDI in e-commerce' norms likely to change? Will they be re-clarified to allow e-commerce platforms to invest in or even acquire a majority stake in traditional retail?</p><p>How governments can regulate platform companies, prevent market consolidation by the digital behemoths and enable alternative platform models will be critical policy imperatives for the coming years. The dominant e-commerce narrative encapsulates a creeping dissipation of free and fair economies. A cross-movement mobilisation of workers, small traders and social justice activists is necessary to recover the idea of digital infrastructures for those at the margins and to ensure that policy can avert the disastrous consequences of a post-covid disaster capitalism.</p><p>--- (Kafila.org)</p><p>[The authors are with IT for Change, Bangalore]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KMRTMS-0052927569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KMRTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YP3-RNY1-JB5M-W0F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373684</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Kashmir Times, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kashmir Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008EIE</classCode><className>COMMERCE &amp;

The European Union, which has been more active so far, has imposed hefty fines on Google, Apple and Amazon for anti-competitive practices. It has passed tough data privacy laws. Recently, it accused social media platforms of falling short on their promises to combat fake news before the European Parliament elections last month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In March, the British government released a report calling for a new digital market regulator to police the activities of large technology companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And now the US Congress is launching its own investigation into the activities of these companies. Last week, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ms Nancy Pelosi, tweeted: \"Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy - especially when digital platforms control content. The era of self-regulation is over.\"</p><p> The chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees anti-trust issues, Mr David Cicilline, said the investigation will be broad-based rather than targeting any specific company. \"The Internet is broken,\" he declared.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has his own grouses against the tech giants, particularly Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post newspaper, which has launched withering attacks against the Trump administration since it took office. Like many Republicans, Mr Trump believes tech companies, which are often headquartered in liberal bastions such as Silicon Valley and Seattle, are biased against his conservative views.</p><p> Taking on big tech is also emerging as a major issue in the 2020 US presidential election. Some candidates, such as former Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, have produced detailed manifestos on what should be done to rein in these companies.</p><p> As consumers, we appear to benefit hugely from the offerings of the tech giants. Facebook enables us to communicate with our friends and share ideas for free, in words, pictures and video. Google lets us search for anything and offers a host of cool utilities such as Gmail and Google docs, also for free. Apple's iPhone is a technological marvel which gives us access to thousands of apps to make our lives easier.</p><p>Amazon is the ultimate online hypermart that can deliver just about anything to our doors, even from the other side of the world. Through our patronage, these companies have become hugely successful, near monopolies in their respective fields.</p><p> But we're also discovering the dark side of big tech. For instance, we keep hearing about Facebook's privacy violations, including its leaking of the personal information of millions of users, which was then used to manipulate political opinions.</p><p> We have learnt that some tech giants have been conduits for misinformation, hate speech and extremism, with their platforms even used as tools to foment mob violence and genocide and to broadcast mass shootings in places as far afield as India, Myanmar and New Zealand.</p><p>  On the way to becoming monopolies, the tech giants are alleged to have abused their economic power and been permitted by regulators to do so. For instance, they have been allowed to acquire their rivals, as Facebook did with WhatsApp and Instagram. They have also got away with undermining their competitors.</p><p> The music-streaming service Spotify has complained to the EU that, through its app store, Apple takes a 30 per cent cut on Spotify subscriptions which forces Spotify to charge its subscribers more than they would pay for the same music on Apple Music. In 2017, the EU fined Google (EURO)2.4 billion (S$3.7 billion) for illegally favouring its own comparison shopping service in its search results, while demoting those of its rivals such as Yelp, Tripadvisor and Foundem.</p><p>Amazon's abuse of dominance has been chronicled in detail by the legal scholar Lina Khan of Columbia Law School and others. For instance, Ms Khan alleges that Amazon practises predatory pricing, undercutting competitors in certain product lines until they go out of business or are forced to sell to Amazon, as happened in the case of the baby products retailer diapers.com.</p><p>Amazon's triple role as a retailer of products, a producer of private-label goods under its AmazonBasics brand and a provider of cloud-computing services to many of its competitors also gives it unfair advantages.</p><p> Through its retail platform, it collects information on what products are selling well and then offers those same products at a lower price on AmazonBasics. So, its competitors take risks by launching new products and selling them on Amazon, and if they are successful, Amazon can replicate them and sell them cheaper.</p><p> Through its cloud platform, which is a money spinner, it can subsidise its retail business and undercut competitors. It can also see which start-ups are using its services most intensively and then invest in those companies.</p><p> Some observers point out that, with artificial intelligence, Amazon's unfair advantage could get magnified: If you say to your Amazon-produced chatbot Alexa, \"Alexa, order me a dozen AAA batteries\", Alexa might order Amazon batteries from its AmazonBasics range. Its competitors may be ignored.</p><p> The basic issue here is conflict of interest. Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook offer market platforms, but also do business on those same platforms, using the data that they collect to compete with their own customers. What's more, they are near-monopolies; their customers have few alternative platforms to go to.</p><p> After all the allegations and convictions so far, the tech giants are no longer viewed as the corporate paragons of the 21st century, but as opportunists, free riders and parasites. Their success is no longer seen as just a simple story of technological innovation and marketing genius, but also a story of dirty tricks abetted by lax regulation.</p><p> So what can be done'</p><p>  The proponents of regulation suggest, first, that existing laws against anti-competitive practices be more aggressively enforced, as the EU has been doing, and that mergers and acquisitions by big tech companies be more carefully screened.</p><p>Columbia University's law professor Tim Wu, author of the book The Curse Of Bigness: Antitrust In The Gilded Age, points out that the Obama administration (in which he served) made a mistake in permitting Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, because it was not wise to the monopolistic consequences.</p><p> Together with Prof Warren, Prof Wu now favours breaking up Facebook to enable WhatsApp and Instagram to resume their roles as rivals. Prof Warren also proposes breaking up Google and Amazon, reversing acquisitions that were waved through by regulators.</p><p> But experts also call for antitrust laws to be updated. One of the key guiding principles of existing antitrust law is the Consumer Welfare Standard, which focuses mainly on the issue of whether monopolistic practices harm consumers by driving up prices or lowering quality and choice.</p><p>                      But big-tech companies pass this test with flying colours. For instance, the basic services offered by Google and Facebook are free for consumers, and Amazon's retail operations have led to lower prices and wider choices.</p><p> Ms Khan points out that first of all, the apparently free services offered to us by Facebook and Google are not really free; we pay for them with our data. As is often said of such Internet platforms: if you are using a free service and you are not the customer, you are the product. Indeed, this is the key to achieving dominance.</p><p> Give consumers a free service, then get billions to sign up, benefiting from network effects, encourage maximum engagement, collect massive amounts of data on consumers, then turn around and sell that data to companies.</p><p> She also points out that the Consumer Welfare Standard ignores the fact that companies which operate across different lines of business online leads to conflicts of interest. It also does not prevent companies from becoming monopolies, for example, by undercutting rivals through predatory pricing, which existing law does not penalise. In short, the existing standard does not promote competition.</p><p> Prof Warren proposes that laws should be changed so that tech companies which offer platforms for business should be barred from doing business on their own platforms. They should be treated as \"platform utilities\" and regulated as such.</p><p> There are other ideas. On the key issue of the use of personal data, Mr Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, who once mentored its founder Mark Zuckerberg and who has now become one of the company's biggest critics, proposes that users' data should belong to users, who should be free to sell their data directly to advertisers, bypassing platforms like Facebook and Google.</p><p> The British government report proposes compelling platforms to share data about consumers with all their competitors to lower barriers to entry and dilute the concentration of market power.</p><p>  Some experts suggest that the technologies on which big tech companies have built their fortunes should be treated as public goods.</p><p> Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London, where she is professor of innovation and public value, reminds us in her book The Value Of Everything, that innovation is a collective process, not just the result of clever corporate strategies.</p><p> The development of the Internet was pioneered by the US Department of Defence and funded by taxpayers. The World Wide Web was developed at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, known as Cern, a publicly funded lab in Switzerland. The GPS, which powers a multitude of apps, was funded by the US Navy. The benefits of these technologies, such as big data, should thus be shared collectively, not be exclusively appropriated by companies that exploit them.</p><p>            So the stage is set for a showdown between big tech and lawmakers.</p><p> Both sides have a case. While concerns about monopolistic practices are real, the tech companies can argue that they have delivered compelling benefits. Thanks to them, consumers are better off than they ever were, in terms of their abilities to communicate, their access to information and their choices in what goods and services they can buy. Companies are better off too - even if they are small, they can connect with consumers more easily, use free online utilities and access cloud services on the cheap.</p><p> Big tech is also politically powerful, and rich. It is reportedly amassing an army of lawyers and lobbyists to fight its case.</p><p> It will be a fascinating and bruising battle, especially in the run-up to a US election year.</p><p> Stay tuned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-593800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-XS71-DYX4-002M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1820\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

All of that coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning look like this ahead of all of that. We are looking at a fractional move this morning. Dow Industrial down about 11 points, the S&amp;P down one and the Nasdaq down just a fraction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then this, the World Series headed to a decisive game seven. Washington pulling out another win last night on the road. The game full of excitement and controversy. We've got all the highlights right here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning. Joining the conversation, Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik back with us, pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here, and the chairman of O'Shares ETF's and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary.</p><p>Great to have everybody this morning. Welcome.</p><p>KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN AND ENTREPRENEUR, O'SHARES ETF'S: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. A lot to talk about.</p><p>We've got a lot of economic data out this morning. We have GDP. You've got, of course, the ADP. A whole alphabet of numbers. And, of course, it's the economy that is front and center in the 2020 election, right, Lee?</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Yes, there's no question about it. I think that a lot of people are talking about how the economy is what's giving and the president so much cover right now with everything that, you know, is going on. And I think that Democrats really have to be careful about how they treat this because this is an issue that the American people find dear to their hearts. It's their pocketbooks. People are feeling good. A lot of economic data that is in favor of the president right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you, if there's one person that is coming across, as well as anybody opposite the president, would be Tulsi Gabbard. And I know you are a big supporter of Tulsi Gabbard, Omeed. Does she look at the economy as a driving force? Is that part of her platform as well?</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: There's no doubt about it. But the way he get -- she gets there is a little different. She starts with foreign policy and says the premise is, we've wasted $6 trillion over 18 years on regime change wars, we've got a trillion dollar deficit, but six times that have gone to wars that haven't made us safer. So what can we do with money like that to put in the pockets of the American people and do some of the programs people say we don't have the money for. So she absolutely thinks the economy's important, but she's starting from foreign policy and backing into it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and she comes across really well in that. I'll tell you, it's hard for the group of Democrats to even touch the economy because it's so vibrant right now. They don't -- they don't want to go there, Kevin. I mean look at the start-up situation, look at the valuations in the private market.</p><p>O'LEARY: I try and, you know, forget about the circus in Washington because I look at it through the lens of an investors, and I simply look at this. In the history of modern times in politics, there's never been a president that loses their mandate when you're at full employment. Regardless of impeachment or circus or anything else, this president's policies have driven the economy through dynamics I haven't seen in my whole investment like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>O'LEARY: And so I'm looking at it through the lens of an investment in private companies and foreign. While we're under 4 percent unemployment, the chance that he loses a second mandate, in my view, is zero. Whether you like him or you don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because of the economic story.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, you're also in the private market all the time.</p><p>MALIK: Absolutely. And I -- and I echo Kevin. We know each other. And so I couldn't agree more.</p><p>What I would say is, the Democrats are going to try to make this about Trump the individual, not the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MALIK: They tried that in 2016. It failed. Let's see if they try it again.</p><p>CARTER: I think Elizabeth Warren is trying to do something a little bit different with the economic story, though. She's trying to exploit this idea of wealth inequality. She's not saying the economy's not good, she's saying that the economy's not working for everyone. And that's the story that she's really -- you know, and she's tried a number of different messages a long time, but that is the one that she's going with right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, GE is just hitting the tape. General Electric earnings looks like it's beating estimates on the top line. The stock is at $9.37. Bottom line right here -- beating on the bottom line, pardon me, beating on the bottom line here. Earnings are better than expected at 15 cents a share.</p><p>We're going to Lauren right here. The stock is already trading up, up two and a third percent on GE. We've got the earnings at 15 cents a share versus an estimate of 11 cents a share. We are just getting the revenue out as well, which also actually looks better than expected. But we're watching the stock move as these numbers are hitting the tape.</p><p>And this, of course, is -- is one of the -- at one point was the metric to look at for the overall economy. It's just not the case anymore, is it?</p><p>O'LEARY: I think GE is actually a crime scene, that's the way I look at it. I don't think the equity has any value. I know that's controversial to say that. If I was going to buy this thing, I'd buy the debt because I can never figure out the balance sheet. I'm a balance sheet guy. It's so confusing. That's why it's been dead money for so long.</p><p>And, look, I admire the new admin to come through and try and fix it, but the balance sheet is horrific. You can't understand it. And so if you're going to take a chance, buy some debt. It will probably convert to equity before this whole horror story is over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even -- even after all the asset sales, you still feel that the balance sheet is confusing for you?</p><p>O'LEARY: Very. And I can't find an analyst who can really drill into it and say, let's go long this equity. There's so many opportunities in the market. And $8 to $9 is where it's been forever. It's dead money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Omeed.</p><p>MALIK: It's a capital structure issue, I agree. I think the debt is something to look at. They are pretty high levered as well. More than they'd like to be. So this is a company, if you're not comfortable going in and analyzing the capital structure, you should stay away from it as a retail investor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet the stock is trading up on this beat. I mean are the expectations so low in terms of what they can achieve right now that, you know, that any win is going to be bid up?</p><p>O'LEARY: You know, I don't know. They beat. And you're getting 2 percent. You're being rewarded 2 percent. And the stock has never moved much past here during this whole controversy.</p><p>I just look at it and say, you know, it's really an option. The equity's an option that this management team can fix it over the next three years. But why take that risk when there's so many other companies doing so well with free cash flows you can actually look at, analyze their income statement and their balance sheet. This is -- this is like going to Las Vegas, buying this equity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. The company is also raising -- raising some guidance here. And maybe that's what's pumping up the stock. We'll keep watching GE shares on this beat and its pretty active this morning and moving up 2.5 percent on General Electric.</p><p>Meanwhile, Boeing is on the hot seat once again this morning. CEO Dennis Muilenburg facing critical questions from lawmakers yesterday over the 737 Max jet. Concerns that employees had had about the now grounded aircraft. Muilenburg apologizing to the families of the crash victims before being slammed by members of the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday. Most notably Texas Senator Ted Cruz.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Look, I practiced law a lot of years. You had your lawyers look over this document and they read a senior leader after these crashes had occurred saying they lied to the regulators.</p><p>Mr. Muilenburg, how in the hell did nobody bring this to your attention in February when you produced this to the Department of Justice? How did you just read this a couple of weeks ago?</p><p>You're the CEO. The buck stops with you. Did you read this document and how did your team not put it in front of you, run in with their hair on fire, saying we've got a real problem here? How did that not happen and what does that say about the culture at Boeing if they didn't give it to you and you didn't read it and if you didn't say, I want to read and see what happened.</p><p>Your testimony here earlier here today is, well, we're not sure what they were talking about because he's not at Boeing anymore. How did you not, in February, set out a nine alarm fire to say, we need to figure out exactly what happened, not after all the hearings, not after the pressure, but because 346 people have died and we don't want another person to die.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lee Carter, your reaction.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, you know, I think one of the most important things when a CEO is in this position and they apologize is that they really address the issue at hand. I think his apology was weak at best. I think Ted Cruz really got the best of him. And everything that he responded from that point forward seemed like it was so over wrought with legalese. There wasn't emotion. He didn't really seem to get what was at stake. He didn't really seem to acknowledge the concerns that we all have.</p><p>People are afraid. And the buck does stop with him. And I don't think he did -- I don't think he did the best job that he could have going in there. I mean it was an impossible situation for him to face, but you've got to go in there, acknowledge concerns, and talk about all of the actions, all of the things that you're doing to make sure that people are safe now, because there's -- people are afraid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And this is his business. This is his future. This is -- I think he did not do a good job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I tell you, they are being really adamant about getting the 737 back in the air in the fourth quarter. So in order to do that by year-end, you're going to need some conviction here and probably more pushback if, you know, you know, if, in fact, they are going to get that plane back up in the air.</p><p>What do you think, Omeed?</p><p>MALIK: I definitely don't see it coming back this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't?</p><p>MALIK: I think first quarter is their best case.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the company did say year end, right?</p><p>MALIK: Yes, they have said that, but a lot of the people that follow it don't think that's going to happen because it's a regulatory issue. The FAA and other regulatory lawyers are going to have to approve that. It's not up to just them.</p><p>I would say there's a human tragedy here. He failed the test, as you suggested.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>MALIK: He's also worried about his personal liability when he goes out there. So he has to balance that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>CARTER: Well, this is --</p><p>MALIK: With that said, this is a duopoly, so it's either Airbus or them. So I think ultimately analysts are thinking this -- this stock will make a comeback.</p><p>CARTER: I mean I think that everybody looks out there and says there's a legal risk, right, and so I have to be so careful because that's a financial risk to the company. What they don't understand is that there's a communication risk for the company when you don't get this right, when he doesn't go out there and really show the emotion, that he doesn't really say that I get the tragedy, I get the lives impacted and this will never happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And here's what we're doing to address it. He just failed that test. And I think that's going to have a financial impact on him and the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, we want to get to earnings.</p><p>O'LEARY: The market just wants the answer to one question, is this a structural fix or a software fix? The reason the stock is so bullet proof is everybody assumes that it's a software fix and it will be resolved in Q1. If it's a structural change that's required, the stock's 250 (ph). So it's going to be a really interesting -- and right now 99 percent of people that look at this say oh it's a software fix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>O'LEARY: But, if, at the end of the day it's structural, yikes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of other earnings that we need to talk about rolling on this morning in the third quarter. We've got FaceBook and Apple reporting after the bell tonight. As you see, those stocks are fractionally up this morning.</p><p>Other big names. You just heard General Electric. You've got Lyft and Starbucks releasing their quarterly numbers this morning. So far it feels like to third quarter, Kevin, has been better than feared? Would you agree with that?</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes. I'm loving these earnings. You know, we have a fantastic economy going on here. Domestically it's on fire and internationally it's starting to look like it could be in a recovery mode. And if there's a trade deal, this market will not stop. And that's why it's been bullet proof. People are thinking phase one looks good. If it gets signed in the next 60 days it will mean phase two will be sometime next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see about that China deal. We feel -- feel like we're following the bouncing ball, but there definitely is optimism on both sides in terms of wanting to get a deal done. It's supposed to be signed at APEC on November 17th.</p><p>Check futures this morning. We've got a market that is searching for direction a bit this morning, but in the negative column. Dow Industrials down 9 points. We've got the S&amp;P down one point and the Nasdaq down three quarters of a point.</p><p>Of course, we are wrapping up a two-day Federal Reserve meeting today. It is day two of the Central Bank's meeting where we are expecting a cut in interest rates for the third time this year, 25 basis points.</p><p>We are also waiting on the GDP. This is the third quarter GDP out. It is out in two hours' time. Estimates call for growth in the GDP of 1.6 percent. Now that is way down from what we saw earlier in the year, of course, on GDP. What's your expectation?</p><p>I know this is sometimes a backward looking number, Omeed, but I feel like the GDP is an important barometer.</p><p>MALIK: It is also for confidence. I mean it's starting to come in a bit. I mean we did have the tax reform that obviously juiced the economy, but now you've got issues that are being weighed down that the Fed acknowledges on a global scale, mostly based on manufacturing.</p><p>I still think the growth is there. I tend to agree with Kevin, I think the economy is generally strong. Let's wait a few more quarters before we run to any extreme conclusions. But by in large, I still think it's a positive story, but things are coming in a bit amongst almost every metric. So, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you worry, Kevin, that CapEx has slowed down quite a bit? I mean it's the consumer that's showing real strength with this uncertainty, whether it be USMCA, China deal. Managers have begun to sit on cash. Maybe not for technology spending, but for other spending.</p><p>O'LEARY: Yes, no, there has been a slowdown in manufacturing. That's evident. But, you know, it's the consumer carrying the economy, 70 percent of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>O'LEARY: This number, this data set on a single basis is not enough to be concerned about. I think we'll still end up somewhere in the 1.8, 1.9, maybe 2, averaging out over 12 months. But it's not a slowdown -- it's not a signal of recession yet, which is why the market remains bullet proof.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will take a look at the GE numbers.</p><p>Let's dig deeper into this report because it is better than expected, both on the earnings and revenue line, and the stock is on the move.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the numbers and the analysis now.</p><p>Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. On the move big time, jumping 5.4 percent right here in the premarket. For perspective, for the quarter that just wrapped for GE, the stock is down 15 percent. But we've got a double beat, as you noted, Maria, beating on the bottom line by three cents a share, earnings coming in at 15 cents. Revenue just shy of $23.4 billion. Also stronger than expected.</p><p>Larry Culp now at the helm of GE for a year and he said this in the press release and this might be what's moving the stock. We are raising our industrial free cash flow outlook again, even with external headwinds from the 737 Max and tariffs. (INAUDIBLE) second quarter GE burned through a billion dollars in cash. It looks better going forward. He made those comments.</p><p>And also GE makes the engine for this troubled 737 Max jet. So the company is saying that they're optimistic with the negative news in the backdrop.</p><p>One other piece of negative news is, it's an industrial company and you have two quarters of contracting manufacturing sector, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you.</p><p>The stock still, nonetheless, is up this morning.</p><p>We're going to take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, California in flames. Crews are scrambling on contain this massive Getty Fire, as officials determine the cause this morning. We are taking a look there and we will take you there live.</p><p>Plus, down to the wire. The Washington Nationals forcing a game seven in the World Series. We're back with some details on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The massive Getty Fire in Los Angeles sparked by a tree branch falling on power lines. The area now under its first ever extreme red flag warning. Fierce winds intensifying up and down the state threatening new power outages in the north.</p><p>That's where we find Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan. She's live in Santa Rosa this morning.</p><p>Claudia, good morning to you.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Maria.</p><p>That's right, we are in a critical window right now with this latest wind event. The winds really have not picked up yet but expected gusts of 60, 70 miles an hour will challenge firefighters on the line working to hold the containment number and keep hot embers from flying, speaking new fires.</p><p>As you mentioned, extreme fire dangers consist -- continue to exist down in Los Angeles where crews on the 650 acre Getty Fire are mopping up hot spots and making sure that smoldering blaze doesn't roar back to life.</p><p>Surveillance video shows the moment it started early Monday morning when high winds blew a branch into a power line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was, simply put, in plain parlance, an act of God, that the wind broke off a tree branch, threw that tree branch because of these strong winds far enough to cause a spark off a line that is still intact there, but you can see a little bit of the damage on it. Most likely caused those sparks to fall and begin this fire. And then we were off to the races.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: Utility companies have been turning off the power to prevent these kinds of fires. But in northern California, another round of blackouts has people fed up. Some have been without electricity since Saturday and are having to search for places to charge their phones, get gas, buy food and ice. Many businesses without generators have had to close, creating hardships across the board.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody's losing money. The companies are losing money. The employees are losing money. And so it's not a good situation for anybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: Yes, and it's a safety issue too because some cell towers are out of power and that has many residents' concerns that they might not get their text messages warning them that they need to evacuate if this fire continues to grow. It has now grown to more than 76,000 acres and is just 15 percent contained one week after it started, Maria. And in the meantime, hundreds of thousands of people are still under mandatory evacuation orders, both here and in southern California as well.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a shame really.</p><p>Claudia, thank you. We will get back to you as more news develops.</p><p>Coming up, ridesharing rivals teaming up. Uber and Lyft banning together, fighting California's new labor laws. Wait until you hear this.</p><p>And then Fed in focus. Investors are waiting on the Central Bank's decision today as new uncertainty over China trade moves markets this morning. We're going to preview the Fed meeting when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we've got a busy day for markets this morning. We're looking at earnings. We've got the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, which we'll get at 2:00 this afternoon. And this morning we get the first look at third quarter GDP.</p><p>Futures this morning ahead of all of that are negative, fractionally speaking. Dow Industrials down just 7 points. The S&amp;P is flat, down 1 point. And the Nasdaq down three quarters of one point.</p><p>We're getting new reports that the trade agreement between the U.S. and China might not be completed in time for next month's meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping in Chile (ph).</p><p>Joining us right now is Andersen Capital Management Peter Andersen.</p><p>Good to see you, Peter. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>PETER ANDERSEN, ANDERSEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So with all of that as your backdrop in terms of the economic story, we'll get another look at GDP today and this China story that seems to change by the day, how do you want to allocate capital?</p><p>ANDERSEN: Well, you know, I think that the China trade situation will eventually resolve. And when it does, the market, I think, is acting like a coiled spring right now, Maria. I think that when that gets resolved, we will have earnings growth, tremendous earnings growth, frankly, and continued hiring. You know, we have full employment now, but imagine if we do have a resolved China dispute how much more enthusiastic U.S. companies can become.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, just turning for a moment to USMCA that Maria had mentioned in passing, what do you think that impact is going to have on the markets if that does, in fact, get passed? I was on The Hill yesterday and most Democrats I spoke to said, while their farmers in their constituencies love it, the unions are against it. So, one, how do you kind of handicap the passage of the USMCA and, two, what impact, if any, does it have if it does get passed or doesn't get passed?</p><p>ANDERSEN: Well, I'm on the side of, I think it will get passed because even though the unions do have power, I think the logical thing to do is to pass that bill. And when that does pass, I think, as I was saying before, employment, more capital expenditures that will fuel even more growth in this country, as unbelievable as it seems, because right now I think we're doing exceptionally well and, you know, the Fed is wrestling, frankly, with, can we do any better? And I think many companies are on hold because they're just waiting for that coiled spring to unleash, which will be when the China trade situation does get resolved.</p><p>O'LEARY: Peter, let me ask you a question about that coiled spring. What matters most for S&amp;P companies, and certainly small companies doing businesses in China is two things, IP (ph) protection, which we don't have in phase one, and access to their growing middle class market, which we don't have in phase one.</p><p>What's your handicap on when we actually get the meat of the deal? How long is it going to take to get those two things, because that's where I'm going to get growth explosion in earnings?</p><p>ANDERSEN: Right. Right. And, you know, when this was first announced, this whole issue with China trade, I think we were all to optimistic thinking it was going to be solved, frankly, overnight. But, you know, negotiating with China, it takes more than just jumping on an airplane, right, and reading the brochure about their culture. So I'm actually handicapping this to go well into 2020. But I'm not losing the optimism because it makes logical sense for both sides to work out a mutually agreeable arrangement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see if they can get that enforcement mechanism in there. That's the key right now. They need to have some kind of an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China doesn't break all its promises, like it's done umpteen times in the past.</p><p>And I understand that is what they're negotiating right now. And they are negotiating in for phase one in terms of getting that enforcement action in there.</p><p>On USMCA, increasingly I'm hearing positive things. Even -- even Democrats -- we had Henry Culler (ph) on the other day who said we will -- this is his quote, we will pass it this year. So we'll see.</p><p>Earnings, meanwhile, grow long this morning. Apple and FaceBook will report earnings after the bell today. Analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $2.84 a share, revenue of more than $62 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.</p><p>FaceBook, meanwhile, expected to report earnings of $1.91, revenue of more than $17 billion.</p><p>Peter, what would you do with these stocks right here, given the valuations, given the expectations of potential more scrutiny from Washington on big tech? How do you want to invest around these stocks?</p><p>ANDERSEN: Well, you know, Maria, I have never owned either one of those stocks and I continue to stay away from them. I think there are more opportunities.</p><p>But let me just say a couple of things about Apple, for instance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSEN: I mean I jokingly say that, you know, they haven't created 11 phones, they've created the same phone 11 times. And the reason I joke about that is, you know, the details, they're just add-ons.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, I see. Yes, OK.</p><p>ANDERSEN: And I think it's a mature market. I think it's a mature market and I think that they really do have to come up with something very creative and I'm on the sidelines particularly because of the TV elements that they're watching. I mean that's very, very high risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSEN: Who knows how that -- how can you even model the success of something like that? So I stay away from Apple.</p><p>And, FaceBook, as you said, I think the regulatory actions are very, very scary and who knows how those are going to turn out. And those, again, they're difficult to model. As a portfolio manager, you like to pick stocks that you can have a pretty good sense --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ANDERSEN: Of the handicap of whether or not it's going to go up or down. And those two stocks, I think at best, are going to move sideways.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, tell that to the investors who bid up Apple to above a trillion dollars in market value.</p><p>ANDERSEN: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, we've got the October job's report due out on Friday. The economy is expected to have added 85,000 jobs to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate rising to 3.6 percent.</p><p>But I think you'd all agree that this has some -- lots of noise in it because you've got the GM strike, the Boeing situation in terms of the Airbus -- I'm sorry, the Boeing situation in terms of the 737.</p><p>Is it -- is this a concern that job growth is slowing to this number or do you think there's too much noise in it.</p><p>Real quick.</p><p>O'LEARY: Single data set. Too much noise. Doesn't change the outlook. We're still going to go into next year well under 4 percent unemployment. The economy's on fire. There's no other way to describe it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Peter, it's great to get your insights this morning. Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>ANDERSEN: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peter Anderson.</p><p>Fox Business will carry today's Federal Reserve decision live at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. Join us for that.</p><p>Make sure you join us Friday, starting at 8:00 a.m. Our coverage of the October job's report. All hands on deck. Job's Friday. We love job's Friday.</p><p>All right, a quick break, though.</p><p>Meanwhile, setting the scope. House Democrats unveiling a resolution on the impeachment inquiry, giving Congressman Adam Schiff the power to make key decisions. We're taking a closer look at that.</p><p>Plus, the origins of the Russia probe. We are talking with the author Lee Smith coming up.</p><p>Then, the World Series going to game seven, not without controversy. We're taking a look at what happened last night straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, October 30th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Countdown to the Federal Reserve decision. Investors are expecting a rate cut today from the Central Bank. That would be the third cut this year. We're also getting a look at the state of the economy when we get the GDP number for the third quarter at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Join us for that. We've got a lot going on.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the face of all of that, earning season rolling on this morning. General Electric out with a double beat. CEO Larry Culp says that he remains confident it will unlock value for GE stakeholders as their transformation accelerates. Look at this stock, accelerating as we speak. It is up better than 7 percent right now on GE.</p><p>Markets, though, look like this. More of a flat situation for the broader averages. Dow Industrials down 10 points, the S&amp;P 500 down one and the Nasdaq down 3 quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P hit a new intraday high yesterday before retreating and snapping a four-day winning streak. The Dow and the Nasdaq also finished slightly lower yesterday. The DowIndustrials were down 19 points at the close yesterday. The S&amp;P was down two and the Nasdaq down 49.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. The European indices are mixed. The FT 100 down five, CAC quarante in Paris up 12, and the DAX index in Germany lower by 24.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower across the board. It was really on some reports that the U.S.-China trade deal might not be read to actually be signed in Chile next month. We'll see about that. There are wide expectations that the two get together on November 17th, but we are following the bouncing ball of what happens with this China deal. Obviously the two sides are in talks and there are more talks scheduled for this week.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the impeachment inquiry and the origins of the Russia probe. House Democrats are outlining the next steps for impeachment as House Intel Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is being accused of blocking an impeachment witness from answering questions from Republicans. Congressman Devin Nunes and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise were inside the hearing on Capitol Hill. Here's what they had to say?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): To coach the witness to decide whether or not what -- what we're going to be able to ask the witness. I mean we don't even get any witnesses at this point and it doesn't like -- look like we're going to get any ever. But to not let us ask questions, I've -- I've never ever had that. And to see someone coach a witness, you know, this isn't the first time that Schiff -- you know, Schiff's very good at coaching witnesses. Remember, he also met with the whistleblower. So this is -- this is just unprecedented.</p><p>STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Joe Biden himself bragged about it. He said he flew over there and he told them that in six hours he's leaving with the billion dollars of our money, taxpayer money, if they don't fire the guy that's looking into his son. I mean, my goodness, if that's not a quid pro quo, I don't know what is. But, of course, that's why the Democrats want to throw up all these smoke screens. They don't want you to look over there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The House plans to hold a vote tomorrow, not on impeachment but on the resolution and the parameters for moving the impeachment process forward.</p><p>Joining me right now is the author of the new book on the best seller list, \"The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History,\" the author, Lee Smith, is joining us right now.</p><p>Lee, it's great to have you. Congratulations on the book.</p><p>LEE SMITH, AUTHOR, \"THE PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT\": Thank you. Thanks very much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let me start with the impeachment process.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because I think our audience knows how I feel about what went on in 2016 --</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As I've talked about it a lot in these last three years.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you connect any dots with the fact that they are trying hard to come up with something against President Trump right now --</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And completely ignoring what we already know was some wrongdoing by some key players in our intel agencies back in the election year in 2016?</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely. Here's how I see what we're calling the impeachment process, inquiry. I see it as a secret ritual conducted by a cult. I mean they're doing most of this in secret. And -- and I think it's worthwhile thinking that Speaker Pelosi, as the high priestess of the cult, and Adam Schiff as a high priest of the cult, and the purpose of the cult is to protect the swamp. The swamp and what the swamp has done. And President Trump was sent by the American voter to drain the swamp yet it's the role of Madame Pelosi and Mr. Schiff to protect the swamp. The -- what they're talk about impeachment is ridiculous. It has no -- bears no connection to reality, just as Russia-gate. There's no connection to reality.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So just like Steve Scalise just said, you know, look over here, nothing to see over here --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because we know that William Barr is now conducting a serious investigation into the origins of the Russia probe --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As is John Durham. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn now says that the FBI manipulated his 2017 interview.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your new book, \"The Plot Against the President,\" says that this was part of a, quote, multifaceted criminal conspiracy to destroy Flynn even before he joined the president's legal team.</p><p>Take us back to what happened with General Flynn because he was actually the first person of anybody tied to Donald Trump to be surveilled.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean we've talked a lot on this program about George Papadopoulos, about Carter Page --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it was Michael Flynn who was the first person who was surveilled, correct?</p><p>SMITH: Right. That's absolutely correct, Maria. You've had Congressman Nunes on the show often and you've been covering this story since well before the election. You and I have spoken about this. So you know the details of this story very well.</p><p>It started in late 2015, early 2016 when they started targeting General Flynn. Then this rolled into a larger operation against the president, that started to include or at that time candidate Trump and it started to include other Trump advisers, including the gentlemen you named before, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. And if you look at the specifics of the operation they waged against Trump, we see Ukraine in the middle of that. That's why I believe it's important to look at what's happening now regarding Ukraine and this farcical procedure taking place on The Hill as a continuation. It's not just -- it's not Russia 2.0, it's the same thing. They're continuing the operation. It has an offensive purpose to take down Trump, to protect the swamp, but they're also defending against what they did.</p><p>As you say, I entirely agree, they're quite concerned about what U.S. Attorney John Durham is doing. They're very concerned about what General Flynn's lawyer Sidney Powell has turned up and they've been worried all along about what Congressman Nunes and his team have dug up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They really tried to attack Congressman Nunes from the get-go --</p><p>SMITH: Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When he started sniffing around in terms of what's going on --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What went on here.</p><p>For those people who may not be so closely, you know, watching this and like you are, like I have been as well, in very simple, practical terms, tell us what this cabal of people did and whey they did it, beginning at the end of 2015 late (ph)?</p><p>SMITH: Yes. Well, I mean they targeted -- they targeted the Trump team. I mean I think the -- I think the essential point and one of the important points my book makes is looking at newly acquired documents. The point that I make, we've talked about the FBI and we've talked about the DOJ and the bad things that people did in law enforcement and the intelligence community. And that's absolutely true.</p><p>One of the most important things to keep in mind, though, however, is that the prime beneficiary, primary beneficiary of spying on the Trump campaign, which is what the FBI and DOJ did, they spied on the Trump campaign to try to find an October surprise. The primary beneficiary of that was not the FBI, was not the Department of Justice, it was the Clinton campaign. And, in fact, the Clinton campaign got the FBI to break into the Trump campaign, to find an October surprise, to destroy Trump's candidacy. After the election, that's when they rolled it into a coup.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So this was very simply one political campaign trying to destroy the competitor political campaign.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hillary Clinton trying to destroy Donald Trump and Hillary had incredible sources and partners because obviously her husband was president and they have the Clinton machine.</p><p>How far up the lines do you think this goes because every time I ask people, and I do this all the time, who do you think the mastermind is --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the attention goes to the CIA, because we know it was really the CIA that would be able to get all of these international diplomats --</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quote/unquote, like Alexander Downer and Joseph Mifsud and, of course, Stefan Halper to run into Trump campaign people.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How far up the ladder do you think it goes? Is it John Brennan? Is it President Obama?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I mean, we certainly -- we know, we know that U.S. Attorney Durham is certainly looking at the CIA. I imagine we've heard former CIA Director John Brennan say that he's supposed to be interviewed. I make the case in my book certainly in a chapter that Congressman Nunes, he titled the chapter Obama's dossier, which is what he calls the intelligence community assessment of January 2017. I mean Obama asked for this and Brennan used it as the Steele dossier to set up Donald Trump by claiming that Donald Trump won the presidency, won the election, not by -- not by virtue of the vote of the American public but rather thanks to Vladimir Putin. This has created a tremendous amount of problem and we even heard former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, saying that that intelligence community assessment has led to all of the different things that we've had today. And that was ordered by Barack Obama.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's pretty extraordinary that this big lie of coordination with Russia is still going on in Hillary Clinton's head.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She just called Tulsi Gabbard a Russian asset.</p><p>SMITH: It's terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So she's still trying to sort of -- meanwhile, is it fair to say that she actually did collude because she -- her campaign paid for the dossier and the dossier came from Russia?</p><p>SMITH: I mean certainly one of the scandals is, is that they got -- they got law enforcement, a certain section of law enforcement, to help them spy on the Trump campaign. I think the real lasting damage that's been done here is, is that Hillary Clinton paid for a conspiracy theory that has been injected into the American public's sphere. We've been living with this for more than three years. We've been living in the sick mind of the Clinton campaign and Clinton operatives. And that's what the impeachment process is about, it's a continuation of the sickness that the Clintons put into the American public sphere starting in late 2015, early 2016.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee, it's great to have you on the show today. Thanks very much.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And congrats on the book.</p><p>SMITH: Thanks very much. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee Smith joining us there. Check out the book, \"The Plot Against the President.\"</p><p>Coming up, down to the wire. The World Series taking all the way to game seven. Now without controversy, though. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>FiatChrysler in merger talks again.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. Good morning.</p><p>This time FiatChrysler is in talks with Peugeot owner PSA Group. The combination would create an auto giant with 50 billion. This is FiatChrysler's second attempt at a merger this year after it pulled out of an agreement with Renault back in June.</p><p>Well, Johnson and Johnson is disputing an FDA finding that its baby powder had traces of asbestos in it. The company says 15 new tests from the same bottle that was tested by the FDA found no asbestos. The FDA's finding prompted Johnson and Johnson to recall 33,000 bottles, but J and J says an additional 48 new lab tests of the recalled bottles also confirmed the product doesn't contain asbestos.</p><p>The stock was halted at the end of trading yesterday. It started trading in the aftermarket. Right now it's up 3 percent in the premarket. A sock to watch.</p><p>And then we're all going to be watching tonight, I am sure, because the World Series is headed to game seven after an emotional Nationals win last night in Houston, their home turf. The Nationals pulling off a commanding performance. They scored seven runs, setting up ailing ace Max Scherzer to take the mound against Zack Greinke for the Astros.</p><p>The game was not without controversy, we should add. When shortstop Trae Turner was called out after interfering with a catch at first base, whoo, it got real emotional and heated on the field last night.</p><p>You can catch game seven, guys, tonight, 8:00 p.m. on Fox.</p><p>You've got to hand it -- no matter what happens tonight, you've got to hand it to the Nationals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: The Astros were favorites going into the series. They have rocked it. And they've done it on the Astros home turf. You've got to say pretty amazing stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's amazing. Fun.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, \"Made in America.\" A fleece company keeping customers cozy all year round. The source of this unique apparel may surprise you. we're going to check it out. \"Made in America,\" next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>OK, we are celebrating \"Made in America,\" as we always do. My next guest turns family inspiration into a sustainable direct to consumer fleece wear business that keeps customers warm year round. Joining me right now is Dudley Stephens, chief executive officer, Lauren Stephens, and chief operating officer Kaki McGrath.</p><p>Ladies, great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LAUREN STEPHENS, CEO, DUDLEY STEPHENS: Good to see you.</p><p>KAKI MCGRATH, COO, DUDLEY STEPHENS: Thanks for having us. We're really excited to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations on this company.</p><p>Before we get to these product that you brought, tell us how you did it. How did you start this company? Was it your own money? Tell us how you did it.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes, so we're self-funded from the start. We thought there was a gap in the market for fleece clothing and we're active women, we're moms, we're career women and so we thought, we need to elevate this fabric and make it stylish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How fantastic. You opened a pop-up in downtown New York City earlier this year. You were also part of a rotating pop-up store at the Hudson Yard's Mall.</p><p>Is it going to be just pop-ups or should -- do you just get this online?</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes, right now we're all direct to consumer. We do pop-ups, as you mentioned, in Brooklyn -- I'm sorry, in New York, and we have one in Boston as well. We're really progressing online right now, so we're going to maintain that. But, at some point, there might -- down the road there might be an opportunity to touch and feel our stuff that's a little bit more permanent.</p><p>STEPHENS: (INAUDIBLE) store, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So brick and mortar store maybe on the horizon.</p><p>MCGRATH: Maybe down the line, yes.</p><p>STEPHENS: Maybe down the line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes, we've been really successful direct to consumers so far and we've built our company through Instagram and the community on social media and it's just -- the power of Instagram is truly amazing. And the women that follow us, they're super dialed in. They're loyal. We love them. We almost have developed friendships with some of them and it's been -- allowed us to grow our company. And they've been just so supportive of us as female business founders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love the fact that you produce in Brooklyn.</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are women owned and operated and you've got a product that we all love.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're right about Instagram. I love Instagram.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes, it's addictive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I can't believe how many things you can buy on Instagram.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes.</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, touching it -- this is one of your best sellers. This is called the park slope (ph).</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes.</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes. That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Everything is named after a town in Brooklyn.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes.</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which I love.</p><p>STEPHENS: Neighborhoods and streets in Brooklyn, exactly, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so just tell me about the park slope. This feels really cozy right here.</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes.</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes.</p><p>STEPHENS: So that's one of our best sellers. It has a high funnel neck. Our fabric allows it to stand up really well, which differentiates us from other fleeces, I think. And the funnel neck has just become our flagship look. When people see friends that are wearing it or people they don't even know, we hear our customers saying, is that a Dudley Stephens?</p><p>BARTIROMO: How great.</p><p>STEPHENS: And it's starting to pick up that we're, you know, hearing that from a lot of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what's the difference between something flat like this to something like this, which is also one of your best sellers. And this is called the cobble hill (ph). This is --</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes. So the turtle neck underneath is our cobble hill turtleneck. This is our marine-hooded vest, which is a new style for this fall. And it's, you know, this is a little bit more soft, cozy. It's like a teddy fleece kind of in a -- we call it a caramel color with a nice oversize hood and easy to throw on over pretty much anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pricing. What do we know about pricing in terms of how much these retail for?</p><p>MCGRATH: Yes, so our best sellers are each 158. Our prices range from 78 to just about 200 for some of the outerwear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And have you -- had gotten a lot of -- what's been the response from customers so far?</p><p>MCGRATH: Great.</p><p>STEPHENS: Customers are loving that they can wear this from morning to noon to night no matter what the day entails. And we find ourselves that we'll put stuff on. I mean I'm wearing this now and then I'm going to my kid's Halloween parade and I'm not going to change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>STEPHENS: You know, you just feel like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's beautiful.</p><p>STEPHENS: Thanks. I -- this is one of our new sales also. No, you just feel as if you can go from all these different situations in life and you don't need to change and you can still feel polished and put together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We talk about the tariffs all the time and the fight with China. How hard it is or expensive is it for you to be producing in Brooklyn and not having to deal with, you know, a having a cheaper manufacturing plant in Mexico or in China?</p><p>STEPHENS: Yes, we've seen a small impact on our cost of goods due to the tariffs, but we are determined to continue to scale (ph) in the U.S. That's a big -- that's very important to our brand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, the company's Dudley Stephens. Check it out.</p><p>Lauren Stephens, Kaki McGrath, thank you so much, ladies.</p><p>MCGRATH: Thank you.</p><p>STEPHENS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019103001cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCX-5PV1-JB20-G429-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8000\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

This reflects the sheer scale of the global demand shock courtesy of the Great Lockdown, and one that overwhelms the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16ac91d8-42bf-4190-88de-f3d89b2b36f4\"> recent production cuts</url>\u00a0from Opec and major oil countries.\u00a0The International Energy Agency forecast\u00a0a 9.3m barrel a day decline in demand for 2020, with April seen suffering a 29m b/d drop alone. The agency said:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cThere is no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset such near-term demand losses.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>This news of a deflationary breeze arrived after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">IMF</url>\u00a0forecast a cumulative output gap of $9tn in the event of the global economy bouncing back next year. That suggests low interest rates and plenty of central bank support for some time. In conjunction with a flattening curve of pandemic infections across major economies, this helps explain the powerful rebound in asset prices from their March lows.\u00a0</p><p>But as more companies shed staff and enact pay cuts, the outlook for consumer spending casts a lengthy shadow over any future recovery. Advance US retail sales data for March recorded the biggest monthly drop since records began in 1992, down 8.7 per cent. The one bright spot was a rise of 25.6 per cent in sales at food and beverage stores from stockpiling ahead of self-isolation.\u00a0</p><p>This all means that the return of the consumer may well take a lot longer than some in the equity and credit markets reckon. That hardly bodes well for the global economy and companies\u2019 bottom lines. The latest US <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6361247d-a1df-4a50-b0aa-59395801b3f3\"> industrial figures</url> were dire, showing the biggest drop since 1946, while Bank of America, Citi and Goldman Sachs followed JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in preparing for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/374de9f7-4746-4d3f-82e6-32fa749b9cd1\"> large credit losses.</url>\u00a0</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20200415.pdf\"> Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book</url>\u00a0highlighted a sharp contraction in business activity, job losses in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors, and no upward wage pressure. That led the Fed to signal deflationary pressure: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cThe general direction of price inflation was down for both selling prices and non-labour input prices,\u201d with the central bank adding that \u201cthe outlook calls for further downward pressure on prices on average\u201d.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>At least on Wednesday this grim economic toll registered across global equities and risk assets (although a pullback was hardly a surprise given the scale of their recent bounce). Another market barometer, the two-year Treasury yield, fell below 0.2 per cent, its lowest level since September of 2011.</p><p>Here\u2019s the take on the consumer from Joshua Shapiro at MFR, an economic consultancy in New York:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cGovernment support efforts notwithstanding, large increases in unemployment and a lack of clarity about the future will cause consumers to continue to pull back. This will be reinforced by precautionary savings from those whose income stream may so far remain intact but who\u2019s continued employment prospects are shakier and investment portfolio is likely smaller.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>The equity market riposte is that the lack of inflation and a protracted recovery means extended central bank support. A view that earnings expectations are about to rebound in 2021, in contrast to the pain of 2020, has certainly flavoured renewed bullish outlooks from Wall Street strategists, led by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Over at Unigestion, its analysts beg to differ:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cDespite all the policy support and the positive health-related news, we believe that most investors are underestimating the consequences of the Covid-19 recession and its impact on earnings in a highly leveraged financial environment.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Markets duly run ahead of outcomes. But the pandemic recession, for all the alacrity of central bank support, is still going to hammer the global economy and threaten a very leveraged global financial system. Faith in the central bank put option of open-ended support awaits the ultimate test as investors keep a close eye on how hard a landing Main Street endures.</p><p/><p>Quick Hits\u00a0\u2014 What\u2019s on the markets radar?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further pressure on Italian government bonds</emphasis> reminds us that the eurozone has work to do after the recent meeting of finance ministers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be438521-7a36-46ff-ae7f-90603c3d26cd\">Italy\u2019s 10-year yield</url> has risen to a four-week high of more than 1.8 per cent, writes the FT\u2019s Tommy Stubbington. Debt for Greece, Portugal and Spain are also weaker as bond investors sense that indebted countries within the common currency are on their own.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The impressive bounce in the S&amp;P 500 from its March nadir</emphasis> has been led by big tech and, in particular, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. The big three alone have increased their S&amp;P 500 weights by 3.3 percentage points during the past two months notes DataTrek, exceeding the current sector weights for real estate (3.1 per cent), energy (2.9 per cent) and materials (2.5 per cent).\u00a0</p><p>This suggests that investors are betting on tech disruption from companies with the cash to exploit a post-pandemic economy. Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s Richard Waters with a look at how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2be7db4-c445-4a50-9cee-db149eed29dd\"> cloud computing has outpaced</url> the market of late.</p><p>Also of note is the growing divergence between two important S&amp;P 500 service sectors: healthcare and financials. Since early February, healthcare\u2019s weighting has risen to 15.2 per cent from 13.9 per cent, while financials has dropped to 11 per cent from 12.6 per cent. I\u2019ll leave the summary to DataTrek:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cCovid-19 has reminded investors that healthcare is both an essential service and a potential source of disruption (in this case, a vaccine) in its own right while financials bear the brunt of the current deep recession with no offsetting upside.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Those who think equity markets have hit their Covid-19 lows </emphasis>should be mindful of history, argues\u00a0Henry Colvin at Longview Economics:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cIn almost all pullbacks, equity indices retest their lows from the initial \u2018wave\u2019 of selling.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p> The data highlight that 15 pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of more than 10 per cent since 1978 resulted in 13 of these corrections seeing the index retest its low.</p><p>Henry adds: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cOn the other two occasions that the S&amp;P 500 did not retest its lows, both were small pullbacks (of 11 per cent and 12 per cent) and neither were associated with a direct macro shock to the\u00a0US economy.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nearly a third of UK blue-chips</emphasis> have suspended, deferred or cut their dividends leaving the FTSE 100 providing a forecast income of \u00a364bn in 2020 (implying a yield of 4.1 per cent), down from \u00a385bn in 2018 and \u00a375bn in 2019. But the key factor for income seekers is that 10 FTSE members are forecast to pay out \u00a342bn in dividends in 2020, or two-thirds of the expected total according to AJ Bell\u2019s Russ Mould. Expand that list to 20 companies, and the forecast payout rises to \u00a354bn in dividends in 2020, or 84 per cent of the expected amount.</p><p>AJ Bell estimates that at least seven of the 20 companies, led by BP, Shell and Diageo, are maintaining their payouts. As investor analysis references \u201cearnings cover, cash flow, the debt and pension and lease obligations on balance sheets and the maturity timeline of any borrowings\u201d for UK blue-chips, AJ Bell also notes the importance of \u201cany assistance received during the current crisis and how front-line staff are being rewarded for helping to keep the show on the road\u201d.</p><p>Russ adds:\u00a0</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cRegulators are already bringing banks and insurers to heel in the UK and the US bailout package for airlines expressly forbids dividends and buybacks until autumn 2021, after all.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finally,</emphasis> as a former resident of New York\u2019s East Village and where the fire escape was my balcony (East Third street above the <url normalizedValue=\"https://evgrieve.com/2016/08/after-29-years-edge-is-closing-on-3rd.html\"> Edge Bar</url> and down from the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thevillager.com/2019/03/hells-angels-ride-off-from-e-3rd-clubhouse/\"> Hells Angels clubhouse</url>\u00a0\u2014 both gone), here\u2019s a very special       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3L2yw4sunA&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> musical tribute</url> as residents saluted the city\u2019s health workers:\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-c1ce62f78fe94476a3f94d3d585c638b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNW-13D1-JB77-K00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Market investing is a drug for me. My heart, my heart. Kickstart my economic heart. But we've already had one kickstart this year with the CARES Act. </p><p>So, what about a second kickstart? Looks like we'll have to wait a bit longer for Stimulus 2: COVID-19 Boogaloo[1]. While talks between Democrats and the White House have progressed, the two sides remain relatively far apart on several key issues \u2014 including federal unemployment benefits, reopening schools and state and local government aid during the pandemic. And, in case you wondered if the economy really needs a second round of stimulus, the latest employment report should help clarify things a bit. The U.S. economy added just 1.76 million jobs in July[2], only about a third of the 4.79 million added in June. Clearly, the pandemic's resurgence slowed hiring considerably. Since this whole thing started back in March, the U.S. lost 22 million jobs. The past two months saw less than half of those \u2014 about 9.3 million \u2014 return. Now, they say we've got trouble, trouble in our eyes. But Wall Street's just looking for another good time. To that end, the Federal Reserve still has investors covered with 'unlimited' stimulus, at least. They don't call Fed Chairman Jerome Powell 'Dr. Feelgood' for nothing \u2014 he's the one that makes investors feel alright. I've got one more thing you'll understand. President Trump enacted a China ban[3]. It's sweeping but not easily understood, and it could cause trouble for the one they call Feelgood erm, Jerome Powell. When we started Great Stuff, all we needed needed was a laugh. A year's gone by, I'd say we've kicked some gains. When I'm enraged, or hittin' the trades, gains are rushing through my veins. And I'd say we're still kickin' stock picks. But not as much as rocket surgeon Michael Carr Volatility like today's is exactly why Mike Carr developed his 'One Trade' strategy. With the One Trade strategy, you can make one trade on one single investment every week, targeting 100% returns every time you trade it \u2014 in just two days, on average. Click here to see Mike's research in action.[4] (Today's poor attempt at a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce tribute goes out to Sgt. Christopher C. Ret. \u2014 aka Crit \u2014 who wrote in to Great Stuff yesterday. Keep rocking, you crazy metalhead! We'll catch up more next week in Reader Feedback.) And now for something completely different it's time for your Friday Four Play.No. 1: Rocket Man A successful initial public offering (IPO)? In this market? It's more likely than you think. Rocket Companies Inc. (NYSE: RKT[5]) finally completed its IPO yesterday, and the stock skyrocketed[6]. RKT jumped more than 19% in its first trading day. Today, it's up another 14.5%. I know what you're thinking: 'Finally, another space stock to invest in!' Wrong! And I think it won't be a long, long time before some Robinhoodlums confuse Rocket Companies with an actual space company. Or Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. (NYSE: SPCE[7]) with an actual space company. Despite its starry-eyed name, the company runs Rocket Mortgage \u2014 formerly known as Quicken Loans. Yes, Rocket Companies specializes in mortgage banking. For better or worse (for those of us who remember the 2008 financial crisis), Rocket flipped the mortgage loan business on its head, turning the process into an assembly line of sorts. Analysts call Rocket the 'Amazon of financial services,' which I guess is a good thing. The company raised more than $1.8 billion in its IPO, making it the largest mortgage lender by market capitalization. Rocket reportedly closes more than 100,000 mortgages a month and has plans to scale up to 200,000 per month. That's a lot of houses \u2014 and a lot of loans. With mortgage rates at lows not seen in decades, Rocket's IPO couldn't have come at a better time. But the stock's success for investors remains to be seen. Great Stuff is keeping an eye on RKT for now. Stay tuned.No. 2: Uber Eats $1.78 Billion Loss Some things are eternal. Time passes. The sun rises and sets. Seasons change. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER[8]) loses billions. Once again, ride-hailing specialist Uber reported a massive loss[9] of $1.78 billion, or $1.02 per share. The results were worse than even Wall Street expected \u2014 a loss of $1.27 billion, or $0.76 per share. But Uber has two contributing factors this time around: the pandemic and the $2.65 billion acquisition of food delivery company Postmates. Still, investors don't appear to cut Uber much slack. The stock fell by nearly 6% on the news. There were a couple of bright spots, however. First, revenue rose to $2.24 billion, blowing away the consensus estimate for $1.82 billion. Second, Uber Eats now brings in more revenue than the company's ride-hailing business. 'We are fortunate to have both a global footprint and such a natural hedge across our two core segments' CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a press release. A natural hedge? That's one way to look at it. Rides go down, Eats goes up. I expect we'll see the inverse occur once COVID-19 is no longer a problem.No. 3: On the Bright Side First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR[10]) is doing just fine during the pandemic, keeping its factories open to crank out those sick solar panels and solar panel accessories. No stranger to the biz of keeping places lit, First Solar scorched the earnings confessional[11] last night. Earnings per share: $0.35. Estimate: $0.23. Revenue: $642.41 million. Estimate: $493.34 million. Even better than a double beat, the company also reported that a profitable second quarter income wise, compared to last year's net and operating income losses. Facts and figures aside, now we can get into the real meat of the matter[12]: First Solar also took the opportunity to sell off its once-stellar operations and management (O&amp;#38;M) business. Essentially, the company wants to pare down its plate-spinning and focus on what it does best: making solar equipment. See, when First Solar started out, the solar sector was still getting its feelers out, and companies entering the game had to hit clients with the all-in-one package: complete solar setup from development and manufacturing to installation and upkeep. But now it's time for change: First Solar is doing the rattlesnake shake and shedding its dead skin. Its O&amp;#38;M division, which saw margins fall from a reasonable 30% just three years ago to just 10%, came under immense competitive pressure. (More on that whole 'healthy competition' issue in a sec.) With the sale, First Solar pretty much leaves North America for the laid-back comfort of its production lines, and the market has so far cheered the streamlining. FSLR is up 15% today, and up 145% since its March lows. The thing is, this isn't even the hottest news in the energy market today. The real potential for your investment dollar lies in a crucial piece of tech developed by one tiny, pioneering American company. It ain't solar or wind, but an energy revolution that could create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech combined! Click here to learn what's going on.[13]No. 4: Buzz Brewing in Big Tech Big Tech has a soap opera in the works that I think would give our beloved EV Days[14] a run for its primetime slot. Enter, Antitrust Issues[15]. Everybody on the tech block played nice (well, as nice as usual) as they stood in the U.S. regulatory lineup[16] last week, claiming their businesses were all fair, dandy and competitive. That's when I set my watch for the real antitrust issues to start coming out. You see, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL[17]) has built up its walled garden for, well, decades now, with its closed-in ecosystem marketed as squeaky-clean exclusivity. This time, Apple won't let a slew of new cloud gaming apps make it to the App Store without passing the company's increasingly strict guidelines. Cloud gaming is Big Tech's next big deal (to some folks), letting people play games that run entirely from remote servers and stream straight to the user's device. Apple Arcade and Alphabet Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOG[18]) Google Stadia were two first contenders, but you bet that Apple won't let Google's gaming service run on iOS. Chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (Nasdaq: NVDA[19]) was also unable to launch an iOS app. Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB[20]) actually brought its gaming app to Apple's ecosystem but had to essentially neuter the instant-gaming part of its platform, i.e., the whole selling point of it. But someone's missing from the fray where's Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT[21])? Still arguing with Apple about bringing the xCloud gaming service to Apple devices. A spokesperson for Microsoft stated: 'Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently' Really, all this does is show how intertwined Big Tech's competitive talons are \u2014 and how far down the 'you can't play with us' rabbit hole Apple wants to go. If Google, Nvidia, Microsoft and Facebook all turn against Apple, that's some serious scratch that Apple stands to lose. But Apple's big enough to basically ignore any legal pressure the rest of Big Tech would push at it. Microsoft is the only one that truly needs this win. Facebook and Google both get enough revenue from their main gigs that gaming is an afterthought for them and you know how long side projects (don't) last in the Google world. Xbox cloud gaming is the only real edge that Microsoft has in the next console season. Does it absolutely need Apple for its plans to work? Or can Microsoft afford to ignore Apple and have Xbox service users make the push for them? And will Apple keep blocking out the haters? Probably.Great Stuff: Friday Night, and I Need a FightOK, so we're not really looking for a fight here, but I do want to order up another slice of that Reader Feedback pie, if you've got it!

This month we invited mergers, acquisitions, and deals specialists to discuss national local economies, the availability of capital, and market outlook. Moderated by Cheri Waldron, executive director at MountainWest Capital Network, here are a few highlights from the event.</p><p>WHAT HAS THE LANDSCAPE BEEN LIKE IN UTAH OVER THE PAST YEAR?</p><p>PAUL SKEEN | PARTNER | EIDE BAILLY</p><p>You're starting to see a late entrance approach to this M&amp;A cycle. You're seeing some companies looking for funding they maybe shouldn't be looking for and that creates a flood of deals that aren't ready to go to market. I don't envy the private equity investment groups who have to sort through the flood of deals and decide what's good and what's not.</p><p>TODD REECE | PARTNER | BALLARD SPAHR</p><p>There were a lot of smaller deals in the state, and that's been consistent over the last few years. But we have two IPOs with Pluralsight and Domo. You have German tech giant SAP acquiring a local company for $8 billion. It puts us on the map as a real player.</p><p>BARRY LUTZ | MANAGING DIRECTOR | WELLS FARGO</p><p>Q1 is down 18 percent globally year-over-year. If you look at the US, Q1 is up seven percent year-over-year. If you think about Utah 2015, $10 billion in transaction value, 524 transactions. In 2018, $14 billion in transaction value, 483 transactions. So think about the global backdrop down seven percent, US down 10 percent, Utah up 40 percent. The number of transactions actually is down about eight percent but the volume is up 40 percent, which is fantastic.</p><p>DREW YERGENSEN | SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT | KEYBANK</p><p>KeyBank publishes a sentiment report for middle market companies. And 70 percent of companies think there is a real downturn [coming] in 2019 or 2020. A lot of business owners feel like they're prepared for it. The follow up question was, how do you feel like you'll do in this next downturn? And there was over 20 percent that want a downturn. You hear that a lot from business owners, as we'd like a correction and feel like valuations are too high, it's too frothy, we feel more capitalized for it and prepared for it.</p><p>MATT BARTHOLOMEW | DIRECTOR | BDO</p><p>70 to 80 percent believe that there will be a correction within the next few years. I would term it as a lot of cautious optimism where private equities are just taking their time, being very discerning, and closely managing their portfolio to be able to weather a downturn.</p><p>ANDY DEREN | PARTNER | ERNST &amp; YOUNG</p><p>Through the lens of the private equity clients I serve, they're looking for specific highgrowth assets that are going to generate a return for them during a specified period of time. And what's attractive about Utah is when you look at the technology landscape, when you look at the people that are creative, and it can be accretive to and compete directly with some of the companies not only in Silicon Valley, but also abroad.</p><p>CURTIS ROBERTS | PARTNER | KICKSTART SEED FUND</p><p>We've seen the relatively recent development of the private IPO. There is so much capital available to fund tech companies and they're still equally, if not more attractive than they ever were, that many times the founders that wish to take some of their ownership in cash can do so without selling the company and can stay in charge. And companies are staying private and founder-controlled for a longer period of time. The result that we're seeing may be a temporary reduction in deal volume, but ultimately full exit through a strategic sale or an IPO will still happen. There are just more ways for founders to get liquidity now because of so much capital chasing.</p><p>HOW DO THE NATIONAL LOCAL ECONOMIES IMPACT M&amp;A ACTIVITY IN UTAH?</p><p>BARRY LUTZ | MANAGING DIRECTOR | WELLS FARGO</p><p>The ecosystem is growing. When you think about the actual macro environment and where we are today, you have the Dow, the S&amp;P, the Russell, and NASDAQ all up double digits. You have volatility which is back down into deal territory. And you have very attractive valuations when you think about the macro environment. April jobs hit, they were positive. Unemployment is at 3.6 percent, the lowest in 49 years. Labor force participation nationally is about 60 percent, Utah is 68 percent. And so you have these really positive macro indicators somewhat offset by trade concerns. We're 119 months into this expansion, the longest ever is 120 months in 1990 and yet, you see that we had a 3.2 percent GDP growth rate in Ql. We're forecasting very positive growth rates throughout the rest of the year.</p><p>ANDREW WAN | PARTNER | LARSON &amp; COMPANY</p><p>What's very unique in Utah is that not only are we able to attract deals to come here, but we're able to attract them to stay here in Utah and expand. But one factor that Utah has to overcome is the culture. We have this negative connotation that Utah is very close-minded, and so companies are attracted to select Utah as a potential, but ultimately, they lose because they think all the great outdoors and everything does not overcome some of the cultural aspect. But it's that image that Utah has as being closed-minded that may be preventing more deals from coming to Utah.</p><p>VAL HALE | EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR | GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p><p>One area where the state is struggling and trying to seek answers is in the area of deep tech. They've eliminated the TC1P grant. It was a couple of million dollars that we gave to early companies that were coming out or just ready to commercialize and move forward. And now they've also eliminated the USTAR grants for the early early-stage technology companies.</p><p>Most states have something there to try to help early-stage companies get over that valley of death. Our legislators said that's not the role of government but these companies need funding, they need access to help them get through that process.</p><p>BRADLEY BERTOCH | PRESIDENT | VENTURECAPITAL</p><p>A lot of us here remember special grant expense. We remember when we had a whole bunch of startups and one or two big companies and there was nothing in the middle. Well that gap got filled and we've got a nice continuous flow of great deals that grow up. And we're going through a real harvest. But if you harvest until there's nothing else left to harvest, then you wonder what happened. And either, you play catch up real fast and to try and revive things, or you move on and move someplace else.</p><p>SPENCE HOOLE | CEO | DIVERSIFIED INSURANCE GROUP</p><p>I think we've done really well with startup and emerging-growth and middle-market but we've not done well on the anchor tenants. Think of it like a shopping mall, we don't have the Nordstrom's here, the big tech companies. I think some of these [companies] celebrate the harvest and the exit a lot. I think it's awesome for shareholders. And 1 would think it's much better for our ecosystem as a whole if we can encourage companies to scale, sustain, be the acquirers not the acquired, and look to build those anchor tenants.</p><p>REED CHASE | PARTNER | TANNER</p><p>It's easy and really good at times to be thinking, \"Hey, this is great. Let's just keep doing what we're doing.\" But things won't always be the way they are and you have to look ahead and invest. And so it is good to see that the state is having these discussions and thoughts around how we create new sectors that don't currently exist. That doesn't happen overnight. And those aren't investments that you make, that you see a return in one, two, three, or five years. Take very long-term and significant investments now.</p><p>HOW MUCH COMPETITION EXISTS BETWEEN LOCAL AND OUTSIDE INVESTORS?</p><p>CURTIS ROBERTS | PARTNER | KICKSTART SEED FUND</p><p>The competition continues to increase, it keeps local investors on our toes, it keeps us motivated to keep our funds going, to continue to raise the funds needed to support the local companies.</p><p>It does have an effect on valuations, but it creates that much more robust of an environment for local founders to say, \"Look, I don't have to put all my eggs in one small basket to be able to raise money for my company. If I've got a good opportunity here, I'll have a number of options.\" And that just means we're going to have more and more funding available.</p><p>VAL HALE | EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR | GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p><p>We're seeing a lot more interest from international investors in Utah now. At least once a month we get these international people coming here saying, \"We have money, we want to invest, point us to good deals.\" And I don't know if we had that type of interest in the past.</p><p>BRADEN MOORE | PROJECT DEVELOPMENT | BIG-D CONSTRUCTION</p><p>For the last 20 years, investors on projects and infrastructure have been locally-based in Utah. And now we're getting a tremendous amount of capital from out of the state and out of the country, which we've never seen before. It has a lot to do with people wanting to be here in Utah, but also just how successful we're being, it's a huge spotlight and we've never seen investors like this before.</p><p>DARIN GILSON | MANAGING DIRECTOR | BANYAN VENTURES</p><p>The number of investment firms, or entities out there has grown significantly. It always felt like there were plenty of deals to go around and share. There's actually a good collegiality amongst the investment community here. I don't know if we consider ourselves competitors as much as colleagues. But I would just say maybe in the lower tech sectors that it doesn't seem like it's as competitive between the firms for deals.</p><p>IS CAPITAL AVAILABLE TO FUND GROWTH IN UTAH? HOW CAN WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE?</p><p>CURTIS ROBERTS | PARTNER | KICKSTART SEED FUND</p><p>There is more than enough. And what has made tech attractive as a sector is the fact that the costs to start a company have plummeted. And it is shockingly easy--not that I want to minimize the odds of success, because there are still a lot of failures--but it's easier than it's ever been to get a technology company. Many get to first revenue with no outside capital because they're so capital efficient.</p><p>BRADLEY BERTOCH | PRESIDENT | VENTURECAPITAL</p><p>There has been a movement in the venture community since the end of the 90's through 2000, you can flip a deal like you can flip a house. And that has lent the accelerator model and the seed models and a lot of venture models into the SaaS and apps mentality. Well, what about those businesses that are capital intensive? Like sciences, medical devices, clean tech, or advanced materials? I mean, they're just left to struggle, right? And it's not only here, it's happening everywhere.</p><p>If you're an entrepreneur and you need money, there's never enough money. It's just the way it is. We can all sit here and say \"Oh, they have more money than they can think of,\"-and in many respects, that's true-but if you're an entrepreneur and you need money, there's never enough money, so it just depends on which side of the table you're on.</p><p>WHAT IS TO COME?</p><p>REED CHASE | PARTNER | TANNER</p><p>IPOs get a lot of attention and they're very exciting. Last year was an excellent year for Utah IPOs and there were almost two. And then 100+ other companies got their money to the private markets and strategic buyers. But over the last 20 years, the public markets have gotten oppressive and difficult and full of regulation and the market innovated and found a better way for both companies to get financing. So while we'll probably have some exciting IPOs and public transactions this year, it'll be a fraction of the overall deal volume and continue in real terms to be a pretty minor part of the equation.</p><p>SPENCE HOOLE | CEO | DIVERSIFIED INSURANCE GROUP</p><p>There's significant headwinds in the IPO market right now in terms of litigation, and if you look at last year, there was a landmark ruling that allowed companies to bring federal class-action lawsuits in state courts, which is totally different than just bringing in a federal court in terms of pleading standards and dismissal rate. That's created a lot of consternation.</p><p>And just the cost of insurance for an IPO company has doubled. Retention rates are going up three or four times. It's the hardest market we've ever seen in the insurance industry in my career.</p><p>CURTIS ROBERTS | PARTNER | KICKSTART SEED FUND</p><p>As a country, we are facing significant policy questions relating to public markets that should be somebody's priority. And there are other countries in the world that have figured out regulatory schemes for relatively small companies to go public. We have to have a circumstance where smaller companies can get access to public markets. If we don't, the wealth concentration issues that we're having in the US will just continue to be reinforced by the fact that they're not available.</p><p>GREG LINDLEY | PARTNER | HOLLAND &amp; HART</p><p>I agree that something should be done for smaller companies, but there has to be some significant changes to make it work. The cost of compliance is just so high that it prices people out of even thinking about it. And then you have the aftermarket issues and trying to have a market for it. There'd have to be a radical change in our system to make that work and I'm not sure who's got the political will to carry that water.</p><p>HOW DO WE ATTRACT MORE DIVERSE TALENT?</p><p>BRADLEY BERTOCH I PRESIDENT | VENTURECAPITAL</p><p>There are a lot of people that need to be brought to the table. And it's a critical thing that we need to embrace because by 2030,70 percent of the wealth in this country is going to be in the hands of women. The number of women who are actively involved as angel investors is almost zero. Husbands are not bringing their wives to the angel meetings. They're not bringing their kids. By 2030, you're going to see the demise of angels unless things start to change and unless we co-opt people into the investment community.</p><p>ANDY DEREN | PARTNER | ERNST &amp; YOUNG</p><p>People are attracted to good assets, whether that's business, or people, or whatever that might be. It's important to acknowledge the fact that there is a shortfall in women in other demographics that are present not only as employees, but in the boardroom and participating in these deals. In some of the private equity funds, it's encouraging to see those boards and the decision makers change and shift balance because we're seeing them be incredibly accretive to value. When you set a platform like that, it truly is magical, because you can see great things come in a very short period of time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-596860706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 596860706</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-X331-DYTM-91S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Utah Business Publishers LLC</copyright><publicationName>Utah Business</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1091-1707</issn><volume>Vol. 33</volume><issueNumber>No. 7\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Utah</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, regional</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

India, in this context, has done pretty well, according to Carstens.<br/> He praised the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana for introducing households to basic transaction accounts, while companies such as Paytm expanded the scope of banking through digital offer.<br/> \"India's Aadhaar programme is a huge asset and one that is delivering benefits,\" said Carstens.<br/> Using the Aadhaar-enabled payments system, people in rural areas can make deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The system allows banking correspondents to visit rural areas with a micro ATM, which can verify customers' identities digitally and operate their accounts, he noted.<br/> However, Carstens was cautious about unmitigated access of data by large technology firms, which don't share the data with anyone but raises the bar so much that no other firm can compete with them.<br/> \"Data ownership is severely concentrated among a few big firms, giving them an excessive degree of market power. And, in many cases, customers are blissfully unaware of how their data is being used. Dealing with these issues is complicated by the inadequacy of existing rules,\" said Carstens.<br/> Big firms can use data to assess a potential borrower's creditworthiness, and even a person's reservation rate, or the highest interest rate at which a borrower would be willing to take a loan. Based on this, a big tech firm can charge higher lending rates, up to the individual reservation rates, extracting a larger share of the surplus from its customers.<br/> \"Proprietary control of data thus amplifies big techs' market power,\" Carstens said in his speech.<br/> In this context, India and the RBI have done a commendable job in developing the UPI.<br/> \"When the market fails to provide for the public good, central banks and financial authorities can act as catalysts. Take India's Unified Payments Interface: This facility allows both domestic and global players to develop mobile payment applications. As such, it lowers the barriers to entry, especially for smaller firms, thus levelling the playing field,\" he said.<br/> \"Defining standards and deciding who should have access to data and how best to manage them are important aspects to consider. Getting the answers right could lessen the scope for regulatory arbitrage and adverse spillovers, keep markets competitive, and channel more of the benefits of innovation towards financial inclusion,\" Carstens said, adding that international cooperation would be vital to ensuring that technology reshapes financial intermediation for the better.<br/> In his opening remarks, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the recent developments in fintech had given a fresh impetus to financial inclusion in the country. Exponential growth in digitisation and online commerce in India has forced policymakers to put in place a state-of-the-art national payments infrastructure and technology platform.<br/> \"The RBI is continuously aligning its regulatory and supervisory framework so that the evolution of fintech can be leveraged to widen and ease the financial access by the excluded population,\" Das said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDERV-n10983705</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDERV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0M-M5F1-DYDW-74MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410681</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The India Economy Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The review, which is being chaired by Sir Angus, will bring together world-leading experts in sociology, demography, epidemiology, political science, philosophy and economics.</p><p>In a statement alongside the release of the report, the IFS said: \"We have not experienced anything similar in the UK but we have now had a decade of stagnant wages and there is recent evidence that 'deaths of despair' - deaths from suicide and drug and alcohol abuse.\"</p><p>Sir Angus, 73, said: \"In much of the rich world, where one or more of politics, economics and health are changing in worrisome ways. If working people are losing out because corporate governance is set up to favour shareholders over workers, or because the decline in unions has favoured capital over labour and is undermining the wages of workers at the expense of shareholders and corporate executives, then we need to change the rules.\"</p><p>Paul Johnson, director of IFS, added: \"I can't think of anything more important than understanding what drives the inequalities we see today and working out what we might do to influence them.

The economist also argues tech or science-based productivity advances in the large healthcare sector are not adequately recorded.</p><p>\"Procedures that previously required days of hospital stay are now done in a few hours in outpatient facilities. Instead, the statistician largely just captures the hours worked by the hospital staff.\"</p><p>How technology is affecting human productivity also has other side effects not captured by the statisticians responsible for compiling GDP data.</p><p>\"A different way to think about the effects of technological change is that the benefits are potentially making our leisure time more efficient - for example, knowing when buses will turn up rather than just waiting and hoping,\" said Macquarie economist Justin Fabo.</p><p>However, Mr Fabo argues the dramatic impact of tech on industrial and human productivity has positive and negative effects with the net outcome uncertain.</p><p>\"The proliferation of some technology, particularly social media and the ability to work outside the office, is probably making some workers less efficient. Some people just spend more leisure time on social media or playing games.\"</p><p>Big tech's global influence on productivity is an important question not just because social media leads more people to waste time at work.</p><p>Stephen Anthony of Industry Super thinks a lack of government intervention means the unprecedented power of big tech is stopping smaller nations like Australia from benefiting from the technological advancements.</p><p>\"Productivity gains are being captured within firms rather than shared with consumers in the form of much lower prices which help to drive purchasing power,\" he said.</p><p>\"Tech producers such as the FANGS have been able to capture the 'rents' from their software services and platforms and use them to further concentrate gains by disrupting and sometimes deregulating broader industries.\"</p><p>In referencing the 2019 research of NYU finance professor Thomas Phillipon, Mr Anthony suggests US politicians advocating for a break-up of big tech may be on the money.</p><p>\"It is clear that concentration is a major issue to faster growth in the United States and that US policy makers have dropped the ball in terms of driving greater competitive pressure in their economy,\" he said.</p><p>\"To the extent that the US is a driver of global productivity this has helped to stifle outcomes.\"</p><p>Mr Anthony also points out how US tech businesses have regularly caused controversy overseas by employing transfer pricing mechanisms to minimise taxes paid in countries including Australia.</p><p>In the US itself a politically controversial issue is the widespread use of giant share buybacks by blue-chip multinationals where profits are simply reinvested to buy back shares. The net effect is just to return more capital to its owners, all arguably at the cost of productivity.</p><p>The rise of the sharing economy</p><p>Alex Joiner, an economist at IFM Investors, thinks the rise of the US tech-based sharing economy has also revolutionised the services sector globally.</p><p>\"Technology has been opening up different forms of growth and unlocking productivity in existing capital,\" he said.</p><p>\"Just think, Uber is the largest taxi company in the world and has no taxis and Airbnb is the biggest hotel chain with no hotels.

Despite these momentous changes, the primary focus is still on China's economy and government plans for growth and expansion.<br/><br/>A wide range of topics are being discussed, everything from new growth targets to the role of technology such as blockchain and artificial intelligence in the future of the Chinese economy.<br/><br/>Growth targets<br/><br/>In delivering the annual Report on the Work of the Government at the opening of the First Session of the 13th NPC, Premier Li Keqiang announced the government's economic growth target of 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as the projection made for 2017, despite China's economy growing at a reported 6.9 percent last year.<br/><br/>This target serves several purposes, ensuring continued and well-managed growth, high employment rates, and high-quality growth among them.<br/><br/>The work report included a consumer price index (inflation rate) of 3-3.5 percent, 3 percent less energy consumption, 11 million new urban jobs and an urban unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. Also unveiled were an expected government expenditure of 21 trillion yuan ($3.32 trillion) and a prudent and neutral monetary policy, with easing or tightening only as appropriate.<br/><br/>China's drive for high-quality development means steady progress in the direction the country has been moving for several years: toward an economy that is driven by technology and services, consumer-focused, green, and healthcare-oriented.<br/><br/>The previous break-neck speed growth is being replaced by high-value-added, intelligent and services-focused growth. This requires a fundamental shift in psychology in terms of a greater tolerance and understanding at the central, provincial and municipal levels of government that the \"new normal\" is a slower, more sustainable and more value-added form of growth, which is not as easy as it sounds. There may be some difficulties and obstacles along the way toward high-quality development, but the temptation to fall back on short term, fast growth attitudes, fixes and initiatives must be avoided.<br/><br/>The discussion and official implementation of a plan for achieving high-quality development is one of the most important outcomes of the Two Sessions.<br/><br/>Globalization leader<br/><br/>China is committed to providing leadership in globalization. This will take the form of free trade agreements with individual countries as well as multilateral trade pacts, further investment in and support for new global economic governance and institutions, and through continued expansion of and investment in the Belt and Road Initiative.<br/><br/>The Belt and Road Initiative will connect the Chinese heartland with Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe by land, and India, Indonesia, Africa, Pakistan and the South Pacific by sea.<br/><br/>There have been and will be investments in ports, railways, the extraction of natural resources and technology. Another seldom discussed aspect of the Belt and Road Initiative is the role it will play in cross-border e-commerce for China.<br/><br/>There has been a great deal of hype around the Belt and Road Initiative as a \"trillion-dollar investment\" and there being trillions of dollars of potential advantages. In the long term, investment may not reach those numbers, but the initiative is nonetheless real and the symbolism is as important as the infrastructure. The Two Sessions endorse the idea that the Belt and Road Initiative is representative of China's ambitions in global trade and diplomacy.<br/><br/>Technological innovation<br/><br/>The Two Sessions are also serving as a platform for China to showcase its ambition in innovation and technology. Many of the CEOs of China's leading tech companies are present at the Great Hall of the People, working on strategies and plans to help China solidify its place as one of the two most important technology and innovation hubs in the world.<br/><br/>Premier Li identified extending preferential tax policies for venture capital and angel investments, encouraging overseas Chinese students to return to China after their studies to pursue \"innovative\" business ventures, expediting the recruitment of highly-skilled overseas talent in China, cutting rates for mobile Internet services by at least 30 percent and pushing for ubiquitous high-speed broadband Internet services in urban and rural areas as priorities for the development of China's technology.<br/><br/>Tencent CEO Pony Ma, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, JD.com founder Richard Liu and Baidu founder Robin Li are all in attendance and talked in detail about everything from AI, to blockchain, to cryptocurrencies. This is a clear sign that technology and innovation are a joint private/public endeavor in a way reminiscent of the Apollo missions and the development of the Internet in the U.S. crescendo has been reached in the debate as to whether Chinese companies listed on foreign stock exchanges should return to China and be listed on domestic bourses. The detail and plan for changes in Chinese laws and regulations that will fast track this process are taking place at the Two Sessions.<br/><br/>According to the Financial Times, \"China's tech companies have faced regulatory barriers to listings on the country's more stringent stock markets. Those barriers are being lifted to increase fundraising for tech companies as part of the government's push to become a global tech power, as well as to improve the quality of investments available to local traders.\"<br/><br/>Alibaba, Baidu, Netease and other big tech firms have voiced support for the change.<br/><br/>Chinese businesspeople are adept at identifying opportunities and making the most of them. In much the same way the country itself has identified key opportunities for stable and secure domestic growth, for going global and for making adjustments that promote quality, value-added growth.<br/><br/>Foreign companies, governments, governing bodies, brands and tech firms would do well to ensure they fully comprehend the policies, initiatives and growth and development targets codified at the Two Sessions in order to make informed decisions about their engagements with China and Chinese companies, and their own \"five-year\" plans for a globalized world.<br/><br/>The author is vice president of China/Asia Pacific and Global eCommerce Practices at Tompkins International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BEIREV-8362148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BEIREV2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWB-NK81-JC5R-21XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 China International Publishing Group</copyright><publicationName>Beijing Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Hillary Clinton lacks the  judgment,  temperament and moral character to lead this country.  She does,  you know it, everybody knows it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, another Obamacare drop out, the latest roadblock for  President Obama's signature legislation.  Why so many insurance companies  will not participate.  On to the war on police, disturbing new video this  morning of a man plowing his car into three officers at a gas station in  Arizona.</p><p>That driver now facing attempted murder charges, we've got the latest on  the police officers' condition.  The deal of the day, Bayer acquires  Monsanto, this is a done deal.  The deal valued at $66 billion. </p><p>Well, they're confirming the deal.  Now, we need to hear from regulators,  that's $128 a share, interesting that the stock is at 106 when this is $128  deal.  Somebody is not believing that the regulators are going to go with  this.</p><p>The fast-food wars are heating up, we are taking a closer look at what  companies are doing to bring customers into restaurants in a slow economy.  </p><p>And markets this morning edging higher, we are expecting the markets to  open a fractionally better on the session, extending a big move yesterday.</p><p>And in Europe, the tone was set higher, stocks edged higher and continue to  be on the upside, the FT 100 up two-thirds of 1 percent.  A big rebound in  oil prices, one of the supports for stock prices this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board, as you can see, the Korean  market is closed for a holiday.  Four-legged friends on a baseball diamond,  a record night with more than 1,000 dogs showing up at last night's White  Sox game. </p><p>We will tell you about that, all those stories coming up this hour.  And  joining me to talk about it, Maverick PAC National Co-Chair Morgan Ortagus,  Kingsview Asset Management Scott Martin.</p><p>And former CIA operative and Diligence President Mike Baker.  Good to see  everybody -- </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show so far.  So, do you still have on your -- continue  on carry vest?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  But today is my favorite  show ever.  I had Cheetos-covered chicken finger, and I've modeled  Shapewear for concealed carry, so, I think like -- God bless America today,  this has been a great show -- </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a good day for you -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  It has -- </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER OPERATIVE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY &amp; PRESIDENT,  DILIGENCE:  Scott and I are still waiting to model the Shapewear. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  I'm just so upset -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Try it on. </p><p>BAKER:  It depends on the concealed carry -- </p><p>MARTIN:  I'm just upset I missed the White Sox thing, you know, I'm from  Chicago, it looks like they had some dogs, and I guess the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes --  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a rough season -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  For the White Sox -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, but not for the Cubs. </p><p>MARTIN:  Rough, seasoned dogs, the day I call -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, got it, got it -- </p><p>BAKER:  That might have been -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for -- except you get choke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  He's appearing here twice nightly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a can't-miss lineup coming up, stay with us this hour.   Former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior adviser Mark Penn with  us this morning.</p><p>And the former Chairman and CEO of Yum! Brands David Novak joining us.   Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney will be along, so, you  don't want to miss a moment of it, do stay us. </p><p>We kick it off this hour on the campaign trail.  President Obama steps into  the campaign for Hillary Clinton who plans to return to the campaign  tomorrow.  Our own Blake Burman has the latest now in Washington, Blake,  good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  To you as well.  For the third day in a row,  Hillary Clinton will be off the campaign trail as she recovers from  pneumonia.  That hasn't stopped though, the Clinton team from rolling out  some high profile help. </p><p>Later today in Las Vegas, Bill Clinton will step in for his wife.  It was  yesterday in Pennsylvania standing behind a podium with Clinton slogan that  the president repeatedly launched attacks against the Republican nominee. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You want to debate who is  more fit to be our president, one candidate who's traveled to more  countries than any Secretary of State ever has, and the other who isn't fit  in any way, shape or form to represent this country abroad and be its  commander-in-chief. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump with daughter Ivanka standing by his side unveiled  his plan Tuesday to reduce the financial burdens of childcare.  </p><p>Throughout the day though, he also continued to keep the focus on Clinton's  basket of deplorables comment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I  call you hardworking American patriots who love your country, love your  families, and want a better future for all Americans. </p><p>(CHEERS) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, Maria, take a look at this.  The polling surge appears  to be continuing this morning for Trump, a new reading out from \"Bloomberg\"  has Trump over Clinton in the state of Ohio up by 5 points. </p><p>Now there's two things to point out here with this poll.  When it's head- to-head, it's 5 points, when they bring in the third-party candidates, it  still remains 5 points. </p><p>And secondly, Maria, this is the largest lead for Trump over Clinton in  Ohio for the entire election cycle, primary and general.  Some might say he  is peaking here at the right time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- </p><p>BURMAN:  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredible number, Blake, I wonder what John Kasich  has to say about that, given his stance throughout the convention -- </p><p>BURMAN:  That he hasn't endorsed him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this entire -- </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, exactly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Election season.  Blake, thank you, Blake Burman.  Joining me  right now is former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior adviser  Mark Penn.  Mark, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>MARK PENN, POLITICAL STRATEGIST:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what do you think? I mean, obviously, it's been a tough  couple of weeks, we hope Hillary is well and is feeling better obviously,  that was a very scary video to see her collapse the way she did.</p><p>Do you think it was wise for her to take a few days off and rest, or does  this feed into Trump's narrative that she is not healthy to be the next  president?   </p><p>PENN:  Well, I think it was unquestionably the right decision given all the  circumstances here for her to take a couple of days off.  </p><p>Who hasn't taken a couple of days off and you know, nursed an illness in  bed and then -- and then come back and bounce back.</p><p>I think this will be a blip here, once she gets back on the campaign trail,  and I think she's going to get a tremendous welcome when she comes back  out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, probably so, from her supporters, there's no doubt.  But  let's talk about these last couple of weeks when she made this -- the  comments about deplorables, you know, criticizing half of the supporters of  Donald Trump. </p><p>And then of course, we're watching this video of her stumbling into the  van.  Can she recoup what has occurred? </p><p>PENN:  I think she can, I think the American people have seen her be a  first lady, a senator, a Secretary of State, who as the president pointed  out, traveled to an unbelievable number of countries and they've seen her  run through this campaign with enormous stamina and always able to carry  out whatever job she was doing to the absolute fullest.</p><p>So, I think this is just going to pass pretty quickly. </p><p>BAKER:  Good morning Mark, this is Mike Baker.  You've been responsible for  some very successful campaign messaging over the years.  </p><p>What do you think is the one message that during the course of these next  final two months, she needs to really focus on. </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I think unquestionably, there's a big difference between  qualifications and competence.  </p><p>And I think -- I think that's a huge gap, I think you saw the president hit  that issue.  I think also you saw some great economic numbers, you know,  come out yesterday in terms of rising incomes, better wages.</p><p>And I think that from her perspective, she's got to say that she's got a  vision for America, she's going to carry it out, she's not going to take  America down the wrong track.  Down a track of division which Donald Trump  would represent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we've been talking this morning, Mark, about who to trust,  and why you know, all of these agencies becoming politicized have just  enraged people. </p><p>And then you've got the mainstream media, it seems that they are protecting  Hillary Clinton.  I mean, \"Cbs Evening News\" edited the Bill Clinton slip- up about his wife's health.  </p><p>We want to show you the original interview, this is not what aired broadly,  but here's the original interview, look at this, Mark. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, if it is, it's  a mystery to me, and all of her doctors rarely, but on more than one  occasion over the last many years, the same sort of thing has happened to  her when she just got severely dehydrated. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, that's what was edited.  Now, we want to listen to the  entire piece of it so that you could see what \"Cbs\" edited out.  Listen to  this, Mark.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Rarely, but on more than one occasion over the last many years,  the same sort of thing has happened to her when she just got severely  dehydrated. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, initially, Mark, Bill Clinton said it happens frequently,  and then he said, well, it happens rarely.  So, they took out the first  frequently.  \"Cbs\" released a statement defending its editing of those  Clinton's response.</p><p>It said the clip in question from former President Bill Clinton's interview  with Charlie Rose ran in its entirety on \"Cbs\" this morning\", \"Cbsnews.com\"  and on \"Cbs News\"  24/7 digital streaming service.  </p><p>One clip that ran on \"Cbs Evening News\" was edited purely for time while  our deadline for the live broadcast.</p><p>What do you think about this, Mark? I mean, \"Cbs\" editing out Bill saying  Hillary frequently has health issues. </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I think they sort of ran the whole clip, I'm glad they  did ran the whole clip.  I think a slip of the tongue was a slip of the  tongue.</p><p>I don't think frequently would be an accurate characterization.  I worked  night and day with the Clintons for 13 years, and I never saw her anything  but fully able to carry out whatever job, and you know, in a very strong  and vibrant manner.</p><p>So, I think frequently was just a slip of the tongue and let's let  President Clinton make some slips of the tongue, he has before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're saying you've never seen her or heard that she does  faint? </p><p>PENN:  No. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, on the health issue, Mark, just close us out on Obamacare.   We're seeing another -- big change, and we're seeing in October, we're  expecting premiums to rise dramatically for the American people.</p><p>How is Hillary Clinton going to address a very bad environment for  Obamacare heading into the election, what's going to be a rough October. </p><p>PENN:  Look, I think healthcare is an issue that the American people trust  Hillary Clinton to really fix.  </p><p>I think if you look at every poll, she has a significant lead on the  healthcare issue, and that she's going to take a look at the problems, and  I think this is a case of obviously going back and mending some problems  that are emerging.</p><p>And I think that's what's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, Mark, if you don't mind me asking.  When was the last time you  worked closely with Hillary? </p><p>PENN:  Well, you know, I was really chief strategist through 2008 and  worked with her in 2000 and 2006, and so that's when I worked very closely  with her. </p><p>BAKER:  OK, Mark, in light of these latest polls, you worried about Ohio? </p><p>PENN:  Look, I think it's a very close race, I think the upcoming debate is  going to be a really decisive event because the American public has really  not seen the two of them face-to-face and seen the contrast.</p><p>I think you saw in the primaries when people saw the contrast between  Hillary and Bernie Sanders in the first debate, it was pretty stark.  I'm  expecting they'll see a very stark contrast and that will make a decisive  difference in this race. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, yes, the debates are going to be critical, Mark.  What does  Hillary Clinton need to do to ensure that she wins that debate from your  standpoint, that first debate? </p><p>PENN:  Again, from my standpoint, I hope the first debate won't evolve  into, you know, negative personal exchanges, but will be on a higher level,  the American people deserve a good debate. </p><p>I think she's just going to get out there and show that she's got a program  for the future of America, that she's qualified, that she's ready to serve,  that she's going to bring people together rather than divide them apart.</p><p>And I think if she shows that she will beat Donald Trump.  I'm not  convinced he's got a strategy where he can win a debate using performances  that worked in the Republican primary. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a very good point, Mark, great to see you as  always, thanks so much. </p><p>PENN:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Penn joining us there.  Governor Mike Pence will join me  tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, don't miss  it, do stay with us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>Still to come, a $66 billion mega deal, the details behind Bayer, $66  billion deal for Monsanto.  Plus, Edward Snowden wants to come home, why  he's calling on President Obama to pardon him on moral grounds, next.  </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A driver plowing into police officers outside a  gas station in Phoenix, we've got the latest, Cheryl Casone with that story  and headlines now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, Maria, and we've got the video, take a  look at this.  This suspect slamming a 41-year-old sergeant and a 33-year- old officer working his first day on the job, obviously this looks  intentional.</p><p>A third police managing to get out of the way.  That policeman arrested the  attacker. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our officers is hit by the vehicle, flies about 8 feet  in the air, smashes into the front glass of the QT and goes down.  Not only  did the suspect try to run over us, but then he fought with us after that. </p><p>These officers could have easily been killed, and I thank God that we're  not planning three funerals right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  But they were seriously injured, those two.  The suspect expected  to face three counts of attempted first degree murder and two counts of  aggravated assault. </p><p>Well, you know, presidents traditionally issue a lot of pardon during their  final months in office.  And Edward Snowden wants to get in on the action.   The national security agency whistleblower has been living in exile in  Russia for more than 3 years. </p><p>Well, now, he says that President Obama should pardon him before he leaves  office next year.  Last month, Obama commuted the sentences of more than  200 federal inmates.  </p><p>Snowden says that he deserves clemency because the information that he  leaked about U.S. in British surveillance programs was morally correct, he  says and benefited the public.  Why don't you decide on that one.</p><p>And it is official, Germany's Bayer buying Monsanto for $66 billion, that  does include debt, and this deal that our Charlie Gasparino said was  imminent this morning did in fact get confirmed.  The all cash transaction  working out to $128 a share, that's 6 percent more than Bayer's original  offer back in May. </p><p>This also includes a $2 billion break up fee, Maria, here's some pre-market  action 106.10.  But, you know, like you pointed out, deals for 128 a share,  we shall see the acquisition creating one of the world's largest  agrochemical firms.</p><p>It could face though antitrust concerns, Maria, and again, as you pointed  out earlier, that might be why the stock isn't moving any higher right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, all right, Cheryl, we'll be watching that, thank you so  much.  Mike Baker, quick comments on Snowden, will he be getting a pardon? </p><p>BAKER:  Good God, no.  This could make my head explode if I thought about  it too long.  Look, clearly, Edward Snowden's life in Russia, the bastion  of free speech and openness is wearing thin on Mr. Snowden. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>And shocking he doesn't like it, but if he comes back to the U.S. -- and I  don't mind, I hate -- great, bring him back to the U.S.</p><p>But you know what he should do, he should face justice for what he did.  I  don't stand in that group who say, he should be hanged for treason.</p><p>No, he should face justice.  And he skipped the country, he essentially  handed over an enormous amount of data to the Chinese and to the Russian  Intel services and others.</p><p>And to say that didn't happen, to say that somehow he was, you know, this  I.T. administrator -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes -- </p><p>BAKER:  Was -- who, you know, we're going to all see glorified in the  Oliver Stone movie.</p><p>To say that he was smarter than Chinese Intel service or the Russian Intel  service and others is naive at best. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm as passionate as Mike is about this issue.  I mean, we -- I  was in Saudi Arabia as a diplomat when this happened.  I saw it directly  affect the meetings we were in.  We know that we've lost people, most lives  because of it.</p><p>We've lost people who were aspiring for us.  There are proper ways in which  to blow the whistle without blowing our classified information, without  blowing Intel message, mean sources.  There're proper ways to do this.</p><p>You can go to the Congress, you can go to the chain of command, you can do  without spilling American secrets to the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And debilitating our -- and preventing our ability to go after  terrorists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, it's fair point, you know, some people debate -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Were fired up about that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some people debate on whether or not -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Hero or a criminal.  We'll take a short break, we've got more debating  coming up.  President Obama giving himself a pat on the back, why he's  taking credit for less pain at the pump.</p><p>He's attributing the move in oil to his administration.  Then the latest  addition to the fast food wars, Cheetos, the crazy combos companies are  betting on to beat the competition, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The fast-food wars taking a cheesy twist.   Burger King is unveiling its Cheetos Chicken Fries today.  The nine piece  order is covered in the cheese crust snack broiled(ph).</p><p>This is the latest marketing cook-off in the fast food industry.  Joining  me right now is the co-founder and former CEO of Yum! Brands, the parent  company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  David Novak is with us, David,  great to see you.</p><p>DAVID NOVAK, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, YUM! BRANDS:  Nice to see you,  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And I know you are out with  a new book which we're going to talk about.  </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you're a real insider in the business.  And we -- you know,  we try all of these new products on the set and we talk about what's new  coming out of these fast-food restaurants.</p><p>What's your take on this newest food items, fast food comes -- are these  companies going to any lengths to get people in the doors? </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, I'll tell you.  One of the things that drives our category is  news.  People are looking for -- to try new things.  </p><p>So, all of us are always trying to come up with good innovation.  But you  really want to have the innovation that sticks.</p><p>I personally prefer Doritos Locos Tacos -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>The nacho piece tacos and the cornichons(ph), tacos that we have at Taco  Bell.  The Burger King has had the chicken fries for a number of years.   So, this is their effort to bring a unique image to known quantity and  we'll see what it does.</p><p>But I don't think it's a huge idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, give me the status-check on the industry right now.</p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's driving business and what are you seeing -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Out there? </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, I think what always drives business is innovation and news  and brands that are well positioned and outstanding operations.  In our  business, if you don't have the core operations right, making customers  happy. </p><p>You don't have a chance, but I think what -- the brands that are winning  are the brands that bring a steady stream of news to our customers and  they're well advertised and well positioned.</p><p>I think Taco Bell for example is leading our industry on that front, great  marketing, great products that people look forward to and solid operations,  that's the winning equation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you're also all about teamwork -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And showing appreciation -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For people you wrote this book, \"O Great One!: A Little Story  About the Awesome Power of Recognition\".  Tell us what you're trying to do  with this book. </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, basically, what I learned is I was running Yum! Brands,  recognition is one of the most powerful things you can do.  I call it the  secret weapon of every leader.  And it's really an awesome thing to do for  people. </p><p>I mean, the last thing you want to have happen is to go to work every day  and not being recognized for what you do.  </p><p>In fact, 82 percent of employees feel they're not recognized by their  supervisors.  So, basically, what I'm trying to do is spread the good word  on recognition. </p><p>And get leaders in the world to recognize people more and get great  results.  And this is a parable about a guy named Jeff Jenkins who run  Happy Face toy company, finds out they're not getting great results because  nobody is happy. </p><p>And it's based on experiences I had running Yum! Brands and running KFC and  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you did such an incredible job.  I remember when the  company went public and it was incredible euphoria and the growth story was  -- the runway was incredible at Yum! Brands.  So, congratulations -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Oh, thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it funny that it's just a little thing makes people  feel good, which is a huge motivator -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For people, and it's -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not done as -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Much as you would expect. </p><p>NOVAK:  Sixty percent, we did some national research for my new company  which is called Ogo Enterprises.  And I'm building a brand, the first  recognition inspiration brand for the amazing people in your life.</p><p>And we did some research and we found that 60 percent of people say they're  -- is motivated by recognition is money, and 40 percent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Say they'll put more energy into work if they get recognized.  Yet,  it just really doesn't happen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  And this is just a shame.  And you know, I hate it when you see  people hardworking, people in the world, really doing a great job, and what  they do isn't noticed. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People really want to get recognized -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Absolutely -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to know that you know that they're doing, you know --  they're working hard.  So, you are a motivational leader as well.  What do  you make of the 2016 presidential election and the skills that are required  to run this country. </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, well, I think what we really need is a leader that can take  people with them and bring the country together.  </p><p>I think what's going to happen this year is, you're basically going to go  into the voting booth and hold your nose and make your vote. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  So, it's a -- it's a sad time for our history but I hope someone,  someday can step up and really get this country moving in the direction it  needs to go.  And that needs to be united. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the most important issue is for customers?  Customers of the fast food business and who are ultimately voters. </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, well, I think you know, in terms of the election --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes --  </p><p>NOVAK:  You know, I think what people want is like anything else.  You want  to be -- in our industry, you want to be proud of the brand you go into,  you want to be proud of the -- proud of the food that you make -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>NOVAK:  I think, you know, what people want to have happen is, people want  to have our country be great, and be proud of what we are and what our  leaders are. </p><p>And I think we have the ways to go in that front, but I have -- there's no  doubt in my mind that this is the greatest country in the world and we will  -- we will prevail in the end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it extraordinary that we haven't seen 3 percent economic  growth in a lot of years at this point? How would you -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize the back drop out there right now? </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, I think it's a cautious backdrop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  You know, I think there's cautious -- cautiousness is everywhere  you look, and there's cautious optimism, but it's -- nobody is really ready  to jump in that pool and say hey, you know we're there yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's really important, that's why this book is so  important, \"O Great One!: A Little Story about the Awesome Power of  Recognition\", congratulations on the book, David, and it's great to see  you. </p><p>NOVAK:  Nice to see you, too, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- </p><p>NOVAK:  OK -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David Novak there.  Up next, the PR nightmare continues for  Samsung, the outrage over the company's handling of its faulty Galaxy 7  phones. </p><p>Then this homerun is leaving baseball fans weak in the knees, check it out.   The incredible hit from one big league slugger, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Wednesday, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, September 14.  Your top stories right now,  8:30 AM on the East Coast, the economy in focus on the campaign trail, both  President Obama and Donald Trump touting their policies, how they have and  will help the American people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT:  America is stronger and more prosperous than  when we started out.  And gas is $2 a gallon.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>OBAMA:  That is even -- thank you for reminding me.  Thanks Obama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're taking a closer look at the numbers straight ahead,  thanks Obama.  Mylan labs under pressure over soaring Epipen prices, and  the Wall Street Journal has new details this morning on the company's sky- high executive pay, how the company compares to the rest of the  pharmaceutical sector when it comes to compensation.  Fears over exploding  batteries, Samsung now telling users to limit charging the Galaxy Note 7,  why this is fast becoming the worst P.R. disaster since Chipotle food  crisis.  </p><p>Markets this morning, little changed but higher, as you can see, markets  are expected to extend the rally that we've been seeing, the Dow Jones  Industrial average up about 20 points right here, fractional moves but  higher.  In Europe, the tone was set positive and that is being led by a  rebound in the price of oil, the FT 100 is up a half of a percent, the CAC  quarante in Paris was higher has since reversed course.  In Asia,  overnight, declines across the board, fractional moves nonetheless but  lower, rather.  And the Korean markets closed today for a holiday. </p><p>Bark at the park, the record night in Chicago, as more than 1,000 dogs  showed up for last night's White Sox game, we will tell you about it.  The  economy a key concern for voters this election and Donald Trump gave his  supporters a preview of an economic speech he will deliver tomorrow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  On Thursday, I will outline my full  economic plan which is completely paid for, through economic growth and  proposed Federal budget savings.  It's going to be something special like  this country hasn't seen in many, many decades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want bring in right now, Steve Moore, Trump economic advisor  and distinguished fellow -- visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.   Steve, good to see you. </p><p>STEVE MOORE, TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  Hi, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we've spoken a lot about his corporate tax rate at 15  percent.  Tell us what we should expect from the speech tomorrow. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, I think there will be a lot of focus on that tax plan because  he does really feel that's the kind of heart and soul of his economic  recovery plan.  We will -- we do have that 15 percent corporate tax and  it's available to all small businesses.  We're also going to dramatically  simplify the personal income tax system which is, you know what, the vast  majority of Americans have to comply with.  We're going to bring the rates  down, get rid of a lot of the loopholes, and make it much simpler.  I think  most Americans, Maria, will no longer -- the vast majority of Americans  will no longer have to itemize deduction.  That's going to make it a lot  easier. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We've also received some good news on the economy  yesterday, top story in the Journal today, household incomes rose.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . by more than 5 percent last year to $56,000 dollars.   President Obama is taking credit for that, listen to this, Steve Moore, I  want to get your reaction.  </p><p>MOORE:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>OBAMA:  More Americans are working, more have health insurance, incomes are  rising, poverty is falling, and gas is $2 a gallon -- thank you for  reminding me.  Thanks Obama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, what do you think?  Do higher household incomes and  lower gas prices help Hillary Clinton? </p><p>MOORE:  Well, first of all, let me say that I was kind of shocked when  Barack Obama wanted to take credit for $2 a gallon gasoline because he's  done everything he can to stop oil and gas revolution that's going on, just  as he shut -- he's trying to shut down our coal industry.  Maybe we should  say, thank you oil and gas industry for providing us with that trail on oil  and gas which has driven down the price of gasoline.  Now, when it comes to  income data, look, there was good news yesterday, no question about it,  that finally we saw a rise in incomes.  </p><p>But I looked at the longer term data.  I pored over this data last night,  Maria, a really dismal statistic, I would sight to you, is that what that  census bureau data shows is that you go back to -- in 2000, 15 years ago,  Maria, the average family have a higher income 15 years ago than they do  today, when you adjust for iNFLation.  This has been a long period of just  no pay raises -- and, by the way, that's the Bush era and the Obama era.   So, I think this idea of cheerleading for the economy is a little over the  top right now.  The other statistic that I found very depressing, still in  this country in the 7th year of recovery, 40 million people in America are  still in poverty or poor, that's intolerable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible. </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  Steve, speaking about the  economy, major issue in markets today is the presence of the Federal  Reserve and Janet Yellen.  Mr. Trump has talked numerous times about  removing Ms. Yellen if he happens to take office.  You have any updates for  us on that as to maybe who he would look empower in the Fed chairmanship. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, I haven't talked to him about he -- who he likes, but how  about somebody like Steve Forbes or Larry Kudlow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOORE:  Two people who've been very, you know, close advisors to Donald  Trump.  What I believe, I think Donald Trump believes as well, is we need a  much more rules based monetary policy that is not based on the discretion  of a few people, but it's basically very signal to the markets, when we're  going to raise of rates, when we're going to cut them.  I know, Maria,  that's not going to make your job too interesting because then we can't  speculate about what the Fed is going to do all the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot to make this job interesting.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOORE:  But anyway, I do think that there will be a new Fed chairman, if --  if Donald Trump is elected president.  And, by the way, on the energy issue  that we're just talking about, you know, Donald Trump has a very pro- production policy where we can within five years, this is one of the things  he's going to talk about, within five years we can make -- United States of  America totally energy independent for the first time in half a century.   Now, every president since a Richard Nixon has promised that, but we can  actually get that done now with the amazing new technologies we have in  drilling. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big part of the story, Mike Baker. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  Yeah.  Steve, good morning.  Listen,  I've got three little kids, and so I think that, you know, a child care,  day care is extremely important issue.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BAKER:  My concern here is the cost.  Are you confident that this is.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BAKER: . something that's not going to blow up the budget? </p><p>MOORE:  Well, just a quick story on that, because as you guys know, you  know, I helped Donald Trump put this plan together and we kind of just  about finalizing it, and Ivanka Trump of all people, you know, said, look,  we need to do something about, you know, working moms, and that are really  struggling with this day care costs, you know.  I'm a father, I'm not a  mother, I don't do the child care stuff and I could -- a lot of us weren't  really aware of how big of a problem this is for working women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE:  And so, this is something I think is going to be really popular  with voters.  And one other quick thing about this, Maria, we're also going  to offer a corresponding credit for stay-at-home moms because we felt  strongly that -- yes, we want to help working mothers with their child care  expenses, but what about the women, like my wife, who's stay at home and  take care of the kids, they need some help, too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  But, Steve, what Mike is asking, I mean, he likes you,  he's got three kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOORE:  How do you pay for it?  How do you pay for it? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain, how do you pay for it?</p><p>BAKER:  Exactly. </p><p>MOORE:  OK.  So -- I'm glad you asked that.  So, we're going to have  dramatic spending cuts in the budget, and some of those will be outlined  tomorrow, in New York.  By the way, I'll be there.  I hope to see you  there, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  I will be there actually.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, so.</p><p>MOORE:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . what's this spending cuts? </p><p>MOORE:  So we're going to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE: . spending cuts, and then we're going to have -- and, by the way,  you know, we're going to look at all agencies of government and cut the  waste and abuse, and some of the agencies we don't need, there's hundreds  of them we're going to get rid of.  The other thing is that Donald Trump is  right about this, if you get this economy from this one to two percent  growth rot that we've been in 7 or 8 years, up to 4 percent that's our --  you know, I said this on Stuart Varney show a few weeks ago, we're going to  get 5 years of 4 percent growth with this economic program.  You do that,  you're going to get amazing amounts of revenues and you're going to be able  to balance the budget within 5 or 6 years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tomorrow we'll hear about the child care credit, we'll hear  about tax reform.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . we're also probably hear a bit about trade, and that's the  area of his economic plan that scares some people.  Are we going to have to  do all new trade deals, is that going to be disruptive?  Obviously, he's  talked about how he doesn't like NAFTA. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, you know, Maria, I'm a free trade guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE: . I always have been.  And so, I don't always agree with Donald  Trump on this issue.  But, I think he's more reasonable on this.  I think  he's going to say, some of these trade deals you asked about which ones  need to be renegotiated, I'll tell you one that's absolutely will be and  that's Asia TPP trade deal.  And, that's not to say we're not going to have  a trade deal with Asia, it just needs to be renegotiated.  It's not in  America's interest right now.  It doesn't open up sufficiently in Donald  Trump's mind, and mine, too.  Markets to American producers, you know.   China, we open up our markets to China and Japan, they don't open up their  markets to us, and we need to get a little tougher with them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I know, I think that's. </p><p>MOORE:  But, I don't think we're going to have tariffs, I really don't,  Maria.  I know that's the term that really scares people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MOORE:  But, you haven't heard -- you haven't heard Donald Trump talk a lot  about tariffs in the last three or four months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true, OK.  So, no tariffs, but he's going to eliminate  fraud and abuse, cut spending.  Are you satisfied on the child care? </p><p>BAKER:  Look, I mean, every presidential candidate.</p><p>MOORE:  Oh, by the way.</p><p>BAKER: . you can go back to 1931, Franklin Roosevelt, talking about  eliminating fraud and waste to pay for programs and it never seems to  happen.</p><p>MARTIN:  Famous words are it's totally paid for.  What we have heard from  Obama, year after year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MARTIN: . didn't turn out so well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, economic growth does pay for a lot of things.  But,  Steve, there is that looming question out there can you pay for it? </p><p>MOORE:  There is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. </p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.  And I'll just give you a couple of examples, you know, we  can cut dramatically some of these agencies like the commerce department,  the energy department, the education department, the only thing to  remember, Trump said we're going to require countries like Germany, and  France and Korea to pay more for the defense that we're providing them.  I  think that's perfectly appropriate.  You're talking about tens of billions  of dollars there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there, Steve.</p><p>MOORE:  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . good to see you, thanks so much.  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>MOORE:  The map -- out, I promise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We're holding you to it. </p><p>MOORE:  OK, see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Moore with the latest there.  By the way, tomorrow is a  big day for us, we've got Governor Mike Pence joining us, 8:30 AM Eastern,  right here on Mornings With Maria, don't miss our special interview,  tomorrow morning.  Coming up, first it was the price, now it's the pay, the  new outrage surrounding Mylan labs.  Plus, struggling to contain the  fallout, Samsung's race to restore consumer confidence following its Galaxy  7 disaster, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, 45 minutes away from the opening bell for a  Wednesday.  We're expecting a higher opening for the broader averages.  We  know that the Monsanto-Bayer deal has been confirmed, and as a result that  gave the market a bit of a boost this morning.  So, we're looking at a  broader averages opening higher today.  A couple of names on the move,  watch Mylan labs, the drug maker behind the EpiPen price increase, facing  new criticism this morning.  A  Wall Street Journal article an analysis of  compensation shows executives received the second highest compensation in  the drug and biotech sector at Mylan.  Mylan compensation out pay its peer  in the industry including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer, among other much  larger companies.</p><p>Also watching shares of Apple, reviews of the company's second series of  the Apple watch just coming out, the Journal is reporting that the devices  found purpose in life with a refined focus on fitness, it still calls it a  luxury over a necessity in the Journal this morning.  How about that PR  nightmare for Samsung, users reporting that their Samsung Galaxy phone are  exploding due to faulty batteries, the company has yet to release an  official response.  Joining me right now, the host of Varney &amp; Co., Stuart  Varney, to weigh in, wow, what a nightmare, Stu. </p><p>STUART VARENEY, VARNEY &amp; CO. HOST:  It's taken $22 billion off the value of  Samsung's stock which is only traded in South Korea, I believe.  But that's  how big it is already.  A few days ago it was 14 billion off those stocks  value, now it's 22 billion and rising.  You know, Maria, it just occurs to  me, Maria, that frequently we have to deal with major companies with a  global brand image and they run up against a P.R. disaster, Chipotle comes  to mind for food poisoning, Takata, the air bag people, exploding air bags,  Wells Fargo, even with high their executive pay, and the cheating with  customer's accounts, these are huge P.R. deals, really bad news.  And you  know it takes some of these companies a long, long time to recover.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised that Apple has not been given a shot in the arm by  the Samsung Galaxy problems that are so evident around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY:  I would have thought Apple got a better boost out of this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe they are getting a boost, and we'll see the numbers  eventually.  Anybody on the panel have a Galaxy phone that blew up? </p><p>MARTIN:  No.  But, Stu, I'll tell you, you want to talk about a P.R.  nightmare, I took a flight out from O'Hare to LaGuardia yesterday, it is  now made the airline announcements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.</p><p>MARTIN: . so when they do the safety announcements, the flight attendants  said, please we also ask you to not charge your Samsung Galaxy phone if you  have one.  So, talk about the basis of the anger there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's part of the airline announcement. </p><p>MARTIN:  It is now part of the airline announcement based on my plane  yesterday. </p><p>VARNEY:  How do you recover from that?  Well, I guess you do in time as the  giant company -- but that is a P.R. disaster. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, for sure. </p><p>VARNEY:  Big time. </p><p>BAKER:  Mr. Varney, it's Mike Baker here, very good to see you this  morning, by the way.  I'm wondering how bad you think this can get for  Samsung? </p><p>VARNEY:  I think it gets even worse, actually, as these stories emerge all  around the world.  Essentially, they've got to withdraw and redesign the  battery on I think at the moment 2.5 million smartphones.  That cost a lot  of money.  You don't know how many future sale they are going to lose.  As  I said earlier, 22 billion off the value of the company so far.  That's  probably going to rise.  And who knows whether the whole Galaxy line can  recover at some point, I'm sure it will because it's a very good phone.  I  have one on the set right here, beautiful screen, all things good except  that battery.  So, I think there's worse to come, but they will stabilize  at some, but I don't know when.  And I don't know when they're going to  rebound significantly. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  Well, it is a big issue, we'll see what happens.  Stu,  we'll see you in about 12 minutes. </p><p>VARNEY:  You will. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top of the hour, Varney &amp; Co. begins at 9 AM Eastern, right  after Mornings With Maria, join Stuart at the top.  Coming up, talk about a  ballpark dog, the crazy walk -- record setting in Chicago, last night.   We're going to tell you about it, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, what happens when you get bored hitting home runs, you've  change it up a bit, 24-7 Fox News Headlines sports reporter, Jared Max, the  highlights right now, Jared, good morning. </p><p>JARED MAX, 24-7 FOX NEWS HEADLINES SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Maria, good  morning.  Now, a major league baseball player makes headlines for taking a  knee, but it's not what you think.  Check out Texas Rangers third baseman,  Adrian Beltre, last night, out to play second inning against the Astros,  down on one knee hits a home run, amazing.  The 30th homerun of the season,  Beltre also did this is in 2011 World Series.  Now, it makes the  highlights, doesn't make Beltre happy, he said, I don't like doing it but  it normally happens on breaking balls when I'm trying to fight off a  breaking ball, somehow the knee just goes down, he swings, he said I wish I  could stop doing it.  He thinks it hurts him more than it actually helps  him.  Hey, however you get it done, is more than one way to skin a cat. </p><p>Conflicting reports over whether NFL players who wears cleats this past  summer -- Sunday, I should say, to honor those lost on 9/11 will be  punished by league.  Still no official release from the NFL on this,  expected fines if there are any would total $6,000 per player, reportedly. </p><p>Over 52 million women watched the Super Bowl this past February, so why are  so few women employed by NFL teams as coaches or scouts.  Now, all 30  percent of front office workers in the NFL are women, jobs in football  operations are scarce for women, which is why the NFL has created a  position to address the leagues gender inequality in particular roles.  The  NFL named former women's football pro-tackle, Sam Rapoport, as the director  of football development.  Rapoport job, she said, is to create the pipeline  for females to enter into positions traditional held by men.</p><p>Guinness World Records set at the White Sox game last at U.S. Cellular  Field, for the most dogs at a live sporting event.  Now, you see not the  mascot, but the actually dogs.  The annual, Bark at the Park, night, a  nationwide tradition which the White Sox actually started 20-years ago.   Fans were told to be in their seats with their furry shoulders at the end  of the second inning, after all the dogs were counted.  Anybody want to  guess how many dogs were there? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't, I mean.</p><p>MAX:  Twelve hundred.</p><p>MARTIN:  You're pretty close, 1122.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I did not look at -- I did look at the teleprompter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>BAKER:  All right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twelve hundred dogs, wow. </p><p>MAX:  Eleven hundred twenty two, and they set -- they set the record, and  it was cool as the White Sox, Tyler Saladino, he had his husky, was in the  crowd as well.  And was joking that from the crowd, from the -- from the  field you could hear the dogs and the crowd, he said they were just talking  to each other, you don't know what's going on but they were just barking. </p><p>MARTIN:  Better than booing which is usually what goes on at the White Sox,  yeah.  I don't know if they even draw usually 1200 fans.</p><p>BAKER:  Do you buy your dog a hot dog when you take him to the stadium?</p><p>MARTIN:  Only if --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I really like this NFL story there, Jared.  I mean, everybody  knows I'm not sporty spice, and they make fun of me for this, and I watched  the NFL games with the halftime show.  But, I think it's great when there's  a private corporation that's taking initiative to get women to the top.   So, good for them. </p><p>MAX:  Yes, definitely.  There are -- look, 30 percent of front office jobs  as I just mentioned are held by women, 52 million women will watch the  Super Bowl, you can't tell me there are some fantastic positions that are  just waiting to be held by people who happen to be women, I don't think  that gender thing really matters anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>MAX: . people watch football. </p><p>BAKER:  Can I ask you one question?</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  How good can the Giants be, the New York Giants be this year. </p><p>MAX:  It all depends on the health I think of the wide receivers.  Victor  Cruz needs to stay healthy, and if that's the case, always such a strong  night. </p><p>MARTIN:  Sterling Shepard is a dark horse, by the way.  He is a good  player.  Good draft. </p><p>MAX:  One other thing on the baseball game.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MAX:  We haven't mention the Mets. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we have to mention the Mets. </p><p>MAX:  Half a game up for the nationals. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nat Candido.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Do not let the Mets play the Cubs again this year, because the  Cubs -- that would be the Cubs bugaboo this year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bring it on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MAX:  For the Indians last night at the U.S. Cellular Field, it was a rough  night. </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a rough season. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We will leave it at that, how's that, oh ruf.  OK.</p><p>(BARKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's good, Bark in the Park.  Jared, thank you.  Jared  Max.  We've got final thoughts from our all-star panel after this short  break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel, Mike  Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The state of Connecticut not exactly known for its fine  fiscal management currently.  That's finally announced a very good decision  which is they're bringing back the far cars on metro north, a new haven  line.  They retired these things in 2014, last rolling bar cars in the  country.  They're bringing them back.  They won't be on-line until 2018,  but it makes that commute back and forth to New York City much more  pleasant. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, you like it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BAKER:  Thumbs up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin. </p><p>MARTIN:  Market volatility is back.  And the real tell if you're investing  at home I think is interest rates.  They're starting to tick up.  When they  tick up the equity market goes down.  Watch that keep happening. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Morgan Ortagus </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm watching Syria.  The Obama administration is desperate for  the latest deal between Kerry and Lavrov, the Secretary of State for Russia  to work.  The Pentagon and the State Department are fighting over whether  we should cooperate Russian air strikes.  This is going to be really  important in Washington in the next few days. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch it as well.  Thanks everybody, great  show today.  Thank you so much for joining us, we'll see you tomorrow.   \"VARNEY &amp; CO\"., begins right now, Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, September 14.  Here are your  top stories, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Hillary Clinton off the campaign trail for a third straight day but the  questions over her private e-mail server are looming large during a  congressional hearing.  And Donald Trump is on the attack on it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  This attitude of arrogance that  explains why Hillary Clinton made 13 phones disappear including with a  hammer, so the FBI couldn't see them.  And why she bleached her e-mails  after a congressional subpoena -- that's after the subpoena came.</p><p>Now the people who destroyed the e-mails are all pleading the Fifth  Amendment in front of Congress.  Anyone watching today's hearing in  Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The latest on the race to the White House coming up.</p><p>Plus protecting your finances.  The Wells Fargo scandal raising questions  for bank customers across the country.  What you need to know to keep your  money safe -- coming up.</p><p>A rough start for Apple's latest software upgrade -- the update causing  major problems for users sparking social media outrage.  We'll bring it to  you.</p><p>And taking the smart home to a new level.  Amazon teams up with General  Electric so you can remotely preheat your oven and start your laundry.</p><p>Concealed carry hits the runway.  We have a look at one company that's  making it easier for women to carry their weapons.  Yes.</p><p>In markets, futures edging higher this morning -- another big move  yesterday and we are extending that move.  Take a look.  The markets are  expected to open fractionally better on the session today.  </p><p>In Europe the tone was set higher, led by a rebound in the price of oil.   FT 100 up two-thirds of a percent now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  And the Kospi in Korea  closed for a holiday.  </p><p>We've got all of those stories coming up this hour.</p><p>And joining me to talk about it Maverick PAC national co-chair Morgan  Ortagus; Kingsview Asset Management Scott Martin; and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.</p><p>Wow, what a story on Google just there.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  It's incredible.  When you do think  about what could be happening.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.   This is just saying that Google is impacting your searches on Hillary  Clinton.</p><p>Then you think, well, are they also impacting your searches on issues that,  you know, favor Hillary Clinton's point of view.  I mean this thing just  goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the refugee crisis.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like health care.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  It's no surprise, Maria, that there's big  mistrust of everything in big government and big institutions and big tech.   That's why were seeing this play out in this election cycle.  People have a  fundamental lack of trust in the institutions and organizations and  corporations that seem to control our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  They control your lives and  Google is in home, it's on your smart phone, it's on your tablet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the problem is you don't know it.  You don't realize  but you could be actually being taken advantage of.</p><p>We've got a can't-miss lineup this hour.  Stay with us.  We are about to  speak with former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, we will ask him  his opinion on this; former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior  adviser Mark Penn is with us; and former Yum Brands chairman and CEO David  Novak stops by as well.  </p><p>Meanwhile outrage on Capitol Hill this morning.  Three former Clinton  workers refusing to testify before a congressional oversight committee  yesterday regarding the Democratic nominee's use of a private server.   Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to  answer and observe my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I respectfully decline to answer and observe my Fifth  Amendment constitutional privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no opening statement.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper also took the stand but  he actually answered questions.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  Did you have a security clearance at that  time?  </p><p>JUSTIN COOPER, FORMER BILL CLINTON AIDE:  No I did not have a security  clearance.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  After you left the White House early in -- when did you leave  the White House?  </p><p>COOPER:  2001.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  2001.  Did you ever have a security clearance at any level after  that?  </p><p>COOPER:  No, I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Was your purpose in destroying the old Blackberry  device ever to hide Secretary Clinton's e-mails from being saved or  disclosed from federal records laws.</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman, no.  It's not in any way to destroy or hide any  information at all.  I was going out of my way to preserve all of the  information that was on those devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's why he used a hammer to destroy the device to  save it.</p><p>Joining me right now is a member of the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, Florida Congressman John Mica.  Congressman -- good to  have you on the program.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R), FLORIDA:  Good to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway from the happenings yesterday.  </p><p>MICA:  Well, I think they're trying to run the clock out.  We saw one  witness not show up, thumb his nose at Congress, two that took the Fifth  Amendment and the other we learned some information from -- this has been a  cat and mouse game from the beginning.</p><p>We started with Benghazi trying to find out what took place, who did what  and we just keep getting the stall and not the information that Congress is  entitled to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean does this just mean you are powerless in this regard?   I mean what are you going to do?  One guy, Pagliano, decides it's just not  imp.  I'm not showing up.  He blows it off.  You have the other two not  revealing anything.  And then Justin Cooper, no pushback on the fact that  he says oh no, I was trying to preserve information.  But we know he's the  guy with the hammer.  What happens now -- Congressman?  </p><p>MICA:  Again, we have to follow the law and the rules of procedure.   Pagliano did not show up.  He can be held as I questioned the chairman in  attempt of Congress.  A referral would then go to the Department of Justice  and there could be proceedings, criminal proceeding possibly against him.</p><p>Right now were looking at the options.  I don't know if the chairman will  give him another opportunity to come forward.  I don't know whether there  are other remedies from a legal standpoint we have.</p><p>But again, you see a stalling game.  This guy played the same thing with  the FBI.  We think he was granted immunity, we don't know to what extent.   But he should have at least showed up if he wanted to exercise his right  like the other two did, he could take the Fifth Amendment before us.</p><p>But again this is just a continuum of stalling; failing to give Congress  the information we are entitled to.  We are entitled to conduct a thorough  investigation.  Our committee has charge over all matters for  investigations under the House of Representatives.  And they are thwarting  that process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning -- Congressman.  Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass  by the FBI.  We know this already.  But can you tell me what is going on  with her top aides?  Are you still investigating them in Congress?  We saw  last week on the show that immunity was granted to yet another person on  the server even though we thought the investigation was closed.</p><p>What is going on with the people who are actually in control of this  information of this e-mail?  We haven't really heard and I think the  American people would like to know what is happening to those people in  power. </p><p>MICA:  Well, we heard from one witness a little bit of information.  We are  trying to gather all the facts because you can't proceed without the facts.   Some information we did learn and we seized from some of the FBI 302s.</p><p>It appears that people like Cheryl Mills, one of the aides to the secretary  possibly ordered some of the destruction of the (inaudible) that should  have been preserved.  We have a requirement to preserve records even though  she had them on a private server.  She had classified information and other  information that wasn't properly turned over and may have been destroyed.</p><p>So we're trying to find out what took place.  And every time we turn to  another witness, we find out there is more.  When they talk to the FBI they  suddenly dump new found e-mails.  It is a stall to try to run out the  clock.  And we are, I think entitled to complete the investigation in a  proper and thorough manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Here's Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- good morning.  There used to be a sense that  there were consequences for action.  And I think there is a frustration out  there in the American public that perhaps things just go to the Hill and  die nowadays whether it's the Benghazi investigation or any other  investigation regardless of where on the political spectrum it stands.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  IRS.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- IRS.  What is your timeframe for this particular situation  where Brian Pagliano ignores a subpoena, doesn't show up.  You know, I  realize you have to follow procedures but you're also Congress.  And do you  have the ability to move at your own pace here and what will your timeframe  be to deal with that?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, unlike some here, we do comply with the constitution with the  constraints imposed on us.  Even Congress has constraints.  So we can't go  and prosecute.  Now we have to see again what was done in contravention of  the law and the rules, take the steps that are allowed under the law.   Unfortunately we have a Department of Justice whether it's been Loretta  Lynch or Holder that are non-responsive and turned a blind eye.</p><p>We have a very difficult situation, a very difficult job.  But, you know,  this is kind of like that old law enforcement serial on TV.  All we want  are the facts ma'am.  And our job is to get the facts for the public and  then take action.  But we have to do that.</p><p>If they want to be lawless our side of the aisle is not going to be.  We  want to comply with the law and the proper procedures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But when you say they're trying to, you know, wipe the clock  out, you know, let the clock run out does that mean that they're going to  just let the clock run out until the end of the couple of months and let  the election happen and then they're hoping Hillary Clinton wins and then  it just dies and goes away because she's president.  Is that what you're  saying?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, again, they already have control of the Department of Justice.   It appears the FBI may have been compromised from there.  And it's much  disappointing with the Director Comey who has had a fairly good reputation  not to give us the information.  You may recall during the hearings I said  the secretary and her interview recorded.  No.  Do you have any information  from that?  Yes we have the 302s.  We still don't have the 302s from that  and some have been kept from us.</p><p>They are playing a cat and mouse game whether it's the Department of  Justice, now the FBI.  It's a very sad time for our judicial system and the  process that should move forward in an orderly manner under the  constitution laws of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What a disgrace for the American people if all of these  agencies have become compromised and politicized at this point.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for your insights.  We appreciate this.</p><p>MICA:  Good to be with you.  We will continue this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so will we.  John Mica -- joining us.</p><p>Go ahead Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I think that was very interesting what he just said.  It was  almost a throwaway comment where he said that the FBI may have been  compromised as well.  What I would say is I don't know Director Comey's  motivation for his decision that he made recently.  I will say this.  I've  had the good fortune of working with the FBI over the years including  recently and I know some of those folks.  The agents there at the FBI, they  are not compromised.  This is not an issue regarding the agents or the FBI.</p><p>This is -- and again, not knowing what Director Comey's concerns are --  DOJ, is it political?  Of course.  But the FBI -- those folks do their job  and investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know some FBI agents, too and I agree with you.  They are -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Look at all the evidence we dug out.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened to Jim Comey?</p><p>BAKER:  You know what, it's a question I don't know where we're going to  get an answer to.  And it surprised a lot of people.  You remember the talk  in Washington was all before his decision.  He's a great.  He's completely  nonpartisan.  He is the most nonpartisan person there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the interview was not recorded.  The interview wasn't  on the record.  Basically her lawyers told the FBI look, if you record this  she's not showing up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, we won't record.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And he let Loretta Lynch off the hook two days after she met on a  private plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain that to us.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's as political as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk about this tomorrow as well when we have a  special guest.  Governor Mike Pence will join us tomorrow, 8:30 a.m.  Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Don't miss our special  interview tomorrow coming up with Governor Mike Pence.</p><p>Still to come: as Hillary rests, President Obama is on the attack.  The  details as he hits the campaign trail.  We'll tell you the reception that  the President got as he stumps for Hillary.</p><p>Plus move over buffalo.  We are testing Burger King's new Cheetos chicken.   How's that for breakfast?</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 releasing more DNC documents. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.</p><p>Well, Guccifer 2.0 disclosed the documents at a cyber security conference  in London yesterday.  They include the Democratic National Committee's  finances and network infrastructure.  Among them Democratic vice  presidential candidate Tim Kaine cell phone number and the contact  information for several top White House officials.  U.S. intelligence  officials suspect Russian involvement.</p><p>Well, if you upgraded your Apple device to the latest IOS software  yesterday and you didn't have a problem.  You were one of the lucky ones.   Some people were hit by a major bug that left their devices temporarily  useless.</p><p>There are reports that some of the upgrades resulted in a so-called bricked  iPhone or iPad.  Basically when that happens your device has a black screen  and access is totally blocked.  Those unlucky people had to plug the  devices into their computers, connect to iTunes and restore their devices  completely.  This is why you should always backup your phone, folks.  Apple  acknowledging the problem; they later did say that they had resolved it.</p><p>And finally, we first told you about this new item from Burger King  yesterday, Cheetos Chicken fries.  But they're out today.  You have to eat  lunch at some point right.  So before we dive into them on set because, of  course, I brought them, we should tell you that the fries are made with all  white meat chicken.  They are covered in a flavored breading that includes  crushed up Cheetos.  Nine-piece order, $2.89 Maria and for all of you  watching your waistlines one order is 280 calories.</p><p>And I brought them to try because I think we should try things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm supposed to believe that this is 280 calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  280 calories -- would I lie to you Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If only our viewers can smell what I smell on this set right  now -- wow.  </p><p>MARTIN:  What's the calorie count?  Is the calorie count per the order?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is 280 calories.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You can taste the Cheetos.</p><p>CASONE:  You can taste the Cheetos?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm from Florida, ma'am.  We love our junk food.  The taste is  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you taste any chicken?</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the breakfast of champions, baby.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just tasty.</p><p>MARTIN:  If you have this with the Red Bull and Vodka in the morning your  day is set.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I'll tell you what, that's the breakfast of champions right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While you're enjoying your breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, let  me tell you we do have breaking news.</p><p>Bayer is acquiring Monsanto -- the deal is done, Scott Martin as we  expected.</p><p>MARTIN:  Have fun with the regulators on that one.  I mean they blocked so  many of this, this year.  It's good to see this being done.  What's funny  about this deal too, Maria, agriculture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Agriculture prices have been falling through the floor.  So it's  interesting to see these two companies get together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $128, $128 a share.</p><p>BAKER:  You know what's interesting also is what Charlie Gasparino reported  earlier which is if the EU or DOJ or both decide to nix this deal, Monsanto  walks away with a $2 billion check.  And a lifetime supply of chicken  fries.  It's a good deal for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at this, the deal is at $128.  The stock is still at $106.   So go figure.  Why is that $128?</p><p>MARTIN:  I think the market does not trust the regulators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they don't think -- somebody doesn't trust -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the biggest deal of 2016, boys and girls and so, of  course, the regulators are going to get involved in this.  They're not  going to let this just walk through.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, you've got to get through the Europeans and the Americans.   It's not just the American regulators.  It's the EU which is just so  efficient.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  Is everybody else eating these chicken fries?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Mike's almost out of chicken fries.  He knows that -- </p><p>BAKER:  I'm going to have yours and yours.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- chicken fries so fast.</p><p>CASONE:  There's honey -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  280 calories -- Scott.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I like this one.  This one is zesty and has horse radish.  So  it's good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I think the 280 does not include the sauce.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we hear new information -- Cheryl.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you-- Burger King.</p><p>BAKER:  And your fingers are not covered in Cheeto dust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  I hope you're having breakfast at home with us.</p><p>Wells Fargo's phony account scandal putting fraud in the spotlight -- what  you need to protect your money.  </p><p>Plus making a smart home a reality -- the big name Amazon is teaming up  with to bring the future to life.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo plummeting over the outrage surrounding the phony  bank accounts costing the company its standing as the largest U.S. bank by  market capitalization.  JP Morgan back up to number one. </p><p>Many hold the bank's sales targets responsible for employee creating  unauthorized accounts.  But Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is shifting the  blame to employees.  He said quote, \"There was no incentive to do bad  things.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former FBI white collar crime expert Ken Springer  and IDT 911 founder Adam Levin.  Good to see you gentlemen.  Thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you.  What do you think was behind this  because now people are saying if this was so prevalent as Wells Fargo --  5,300 employees creating this phony accounts, are we going to see this at  other banks?</p><p>KEN SPRINGER, FORMER FBI WHITE COLLAR CRIME EXPERT:  Well, I don't know if  it's a fraud or a conspiracy because you can't have 5,300 people involved  in that.  I think more than anything it's probably aggressive sales  practices.</p><p>And I think if the FBI gets involved they can probably talk to some of  these people and they're going to find out what really happened.  Was it  limited to one region?  How far up the ladder does it go? </p><p>And I think the bigger issue is going to be if they did this would they  have opened other accounts for bad actors -- whether it's drug dealers,  money launderers and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we don't know that.  I mean we don't know who the accounts  were for -- right.</p><p>SPRINGER:  That hasn't come out.</p><p>BART:  Ok.  So the sales targets, Ken, were set by higher level executives.   One executive actually is leaving the bank with $126 million payday.  Since  then Wells Fargo has to pay hundred $185 million in fines for defrauding  customers.  This reported payday that Carrie Tolstedt is walking out with,  does this add to the wrongdoing in your view?  How does that play into  this?  This doesn't look good.</p><p>SPRINGER:  We don't know.  It doesn't look good.  And it goes back to I  think when Mary Jo White took over the SEC.  She talked about not letting  financial institutions say without admitting or denying guilt, paying the  fine and moving on.  I think they're going to see if there's someone who  should be held accountable for this violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Adam, you've got a book \"Swiped: How to protect  yourself in a world full of scammer, phishers and identity thieves\".  Will  you explain to us how we can protect our money at banks with what we see  happening.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, IDT 911 FOUNDER:  Well, you know, again, here is a situation  where the bank ran off with the stork, consumers ended up holding the bag  that this system encouraged this kind of action.  And the things I talk  about in the book is you have to realize this is a classic definition of  identity theft that occurred.  People were using the personally  identifiable, sensitive information of other people for their gain.</p><p>So what consumers need to do is they need to do a number of things.  First,  you need to monitor.  You should be checking your accounts on a daily  basis.  You should be signing up for what is called transactional  monitoring alerts which means that any time there's any activity in your  accounts, you're notified of it and you should be specifically looking for  small charges or what they like to call ghost charges because usually they  are designed in order to evade bank systems and to evade consumer scrutiny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVIN:  You should also consider freezing your credit so that nobody  including you can get access to your credit for the purpose of opening up a  credit card account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's death by a thousand cuts -- Mike.</p><p>BAKER:  What you think is the proper response at this stage?  What should  they do -- senior management within Well Fargo?  </p><p>LEVIN:  I think that people have to walk the plank.  And I'm not just  talking about lower level people.  I think higher-level people -- the  confidence of consumers has been shaken in this financial institution.  And  as a result it will be shaken in other financial institutions and don't  forget, the scandal that happened a few years ago where a number of  financial institutions were reordering the chronology of debit accounts --  debit charges in order to put the consumer over on the first charge to  charge multiple over limit fees which is one of the things that led to the  Credit Card Reform Act.</p><p>MARTIN:  And that's the scary thing.  I mean this was going on for years  and years and years under Ms. Tolstedt's watch or on her watch and she was  able to stay in the position.  People were getting fired in her department  yet the banking executive did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't look good.</p><p>MARTIN:  If your consumer and you're banking at Wells Fargo, wow do you  feel good about having an account there.  The CEO has said he is not  resigning.  He's not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>LEVIN:  But should there be the question, should there be a call back of  the $125 million that she's getting as she walks out the door.  I don't  think you reward people for being oblivious to things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially since she's walking out with all that money.</p><p>Ken -- real quick.  Final word from you in terms of what we should be  looking at for potential bank fraud.  You are former white-collar criminal  FBI so tell us what we should be looking at.</p><p>SPRINGER:  Well, there is a lot that needs to come out yet and probably in  the next 24, we'll learn a lot more.  But did they really -- we go in and  open an account at our bank.  Do you go in -- do you sign a signature card?   Do you show forms of ID?  I don't think that happened.  I think they  manipulated the system.  But there is still the potential for fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of this culture that you had to meet the sales targets.</p><p>SPRINGER:  I think that's what's going to happen.  I think the bigger fall  fallout is going to be 5,300 people are without a job now.  And they're  going to be kind of potentially toxic trying to get jobs now as part of  this.  And what can they do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  You're going to have that on your  resume.  Yes, I just came from Wells Fargo and this is why I left.</p><p>SPRINGER:  But in my experience -- I'm sorry, Maria -- is disclose it.   Tell it upfront because you know, it's like Drexel back years, MF Global,  people will get over it.  Tell them you were part of it and move on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think the key takeaway here is pay attention.  You've got a  personal responsibility.  You open an account.  You're dealing a financial  institution.  You've got a credit card or whatever it is, your statements  arrive, you've got to pay attention.  Otherwise things happen.  And as you  pointed out this is not the first time.</p><p>LEVIN:  No one has a greater interest in your financial security than you  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bottom line.</p><p>MARTIN:  These other people apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Springer, Adam Levin -- the book is \"Swiped\" -- thank you  so much, sir, for joining us.  Thank you very much Mr. Springer.</p><p>Coming up, another secretary of state and another scandal -- the shocking  claims surrounding John Kerry's tenure.</p><p>Plus making the Second Amendment fashionable?  The company giving new  meeting to conceal and carry.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody; welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday September 14.  Here are your top stories, 7:30  a.m. on the East Coast:  Breaking news moments ago, Bayer acquires  Monsanto, deal is done; valued at $66 billion, that is $128 per share.   This was first reported by our own Charlie Gasparino. (HEADLINES) (MARKET  HEADLINES)</p><p>President Obama on the campaign trail now for the ailing Hillary Clinton.   He used his time in Philadelphia yesterday to slam Donald Trump and his  comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  Think about what's happened to the Republican  Party.  They used to be opposed to Russian and authoritarianism.  Their  nominee is out their praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he  invades smaller countries, jails his opponents and when they interview him,  ask him, well, why do you support this guy?  Well, he's a strong guy.   Look, he's got an 82-percent poll rating.  Well, yes.  So did - Saddam  Hussein had a 90-percent poll rating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Donald Trump responded to President Obama's attack  on Twitter.  He said, \"Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years.   Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez.  He  is the author of the new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance.\"  Good morning,  Judge.  Good morning good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>ALBERTO GONZALEZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Good morning; it's good to  be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I've got to get your reaction to all of this talk about  Russia.  I mean, I seem to remember, quite clearly, it was President Obama  who whispered in the ear of then Prime Minister Medvedev to say, or he was  president at the time, I will have more flexibility, -- tell Vladimir Putin  I will have more flexibility after the election.  It seems there is a lot  more ties between Clinton and Obama and Secretary Clinton than Donald  Trump; correct me if I'm wrong.  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  I think you're right.  We have to remember that we're in this  sort of silly season right now.  We're in a political campaign and there  are going to be outrageous claims, honestly, made by both sides in order to  win political points.  But, obviously, we watch Russia very carefully.   Obviously what they do around the world is something of great interest to  us.  Because they are a powerful nation, they can be helpful in dealing  with certain problems that we need help with, for example in Syria.  So the  notion of having some kind of relationship with them is not a totally bad  thing.  </p><p>But, again, some of the comments yesterday from President Obama, I just  chalk up we're in the political season.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see; so have U.S.-Russian relations changed in the post-9/11  world, where the war on terror has been the top priority?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know, I think (inaudible) depending on circumstances.  I  don't know that I would trust Russia implicitly.  I think we need to --  they could be helpful, but obviously they will be doing some things that  are in their best interest and not necessarily consistent with our best  interest.  So we just simply have to deal with them, I think, with that  kind of mind set.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are obviously were in a very important place during the  beginning of the war on terror.  You are defending that in your new book,  \"True Faith and Allegiance,\" in your new memoir.  What are you trying to  communicate, Judge?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, one thing I try to communicate is all the difficult  decisions that President Bush had to make, and those of us who advised him;  some of them are controversial, but one of the things I hope that readers  come away with is how hard we worked to try to get it right, particularly  in terms of the legal issues that arose.  Many of these legal issues we had  not seen since World War II.  Some of the legal issues we had never seen  before, such as how do you deal effectively and legally with a non-state  actor.  </p><p>So hopefully - you know, I don't shy away from any of the controversial  issues.  They are all in the book, beginning with Guantanamo, military  commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, electronic surveillance,  it's all in there and hopefully the readers will have a better  understanding of the reasons why these decisions were made and the  rationale behind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So once we understand what took place and where we are right  now, the next question is where are we going.  We know that Donald Trump  has talked about expanding the military, investing in the military and  getting tougher.  Hillary Clinton has said she wants to continue many of  the policies of President Obama and that we need Middle Eastern friends  help to actually take down ISIS.  What is the right path going forward?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, I do believe we need Middle Eastern friends.  This is not  something that we can be successful alone.  However, I do worry about the  changing viewpoint about America around the world.  I think we are America.    We are the beacon of hope and democracy and we are expected to lead. I  worry that we sort of stepped back from that.  I think the common phrase is  we are leading from behind.  I just think that puts the United States in a  very dangerous and precarious position. </p><p>I worry that we are less today than we were, say, on 9/11, 15 years ago.   The threats have evolved and I think the United States needs to be very  forceful, in terms of trying to influence outcomes overseas.  I'm not  suggesting we put troops on the ground, but I think we need to influence  outcomes so we don't have outcomes that are contrary to our interests.  So,  I do worry about where we are today in foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you made a decision to support a Donald Trump for  president?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know I'm a lifelong Republican.  I hope to vote republican,  but I'm an American first.  I'm going to vote in terms of who I believe is  best for America, best for me and for my family.  Listen, we still have two  months before the election.  We have three presidential debates coming up.   We've got time to make this decision, which is a very important one because  it is a very dangerous time around the world for us.  Also we have some  serious domestic policy issues that we need to confront, like the deficit.   So, I'm going to make a very informed decision.  I encourage all of your  viewers to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right; so you want to watch these debates and you want to  make sure you're solid before coming out publicly and endorsing the  Republican candidate. </p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on on the Democratic side, Judge, because  two witnesses, yesterday, at a House hearing on Hillary Clinton's email  server pled The Fifth, yesterday, while a third failed to show.  As a  former attorney general, should a special prosecutor have been important to  investigate Hillary's email server?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  That's a difficult one for me to answer.  I do know that the  unfortunate conversation that occurred between Loretta Lynch and former  President Bill Clinton at the airport.  I think that was very unfortunate  for the investigation, and, you know, some AG's may have taken that alone  as a basis to appoint a special prosecutor because, in the end, it's not  about the attorney general's involvement in the case that's important.   What is important is that we have total confidence in the justice system,  that it's going to be impartial in the way it conducts its investigation  and in the decision it makes to move forward with the prosecution.  </p><p>What I worry about what happened here is it appears as a result of that  conversation Attorney General Lynch sort of stepped away entirely from this  case and as a result it fell entirely to Jim Comey.  Most of your viewers  probably do not understand, the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The  FBI Director reports to the Attorney General, and at the end of the day the  FBI is response for investigations.  They present whatever they find to the  prosecutors and the prosecutors decide whether or not the case should move  forward or not.  It seems to me in this case it was sort of turned on its  head and the investigator, Jim Comey, made the decision not to move forward  with the prosecution; and that troubles me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, this is your, obviously, successor, Loretta Lynch.   If you were sitting on your plane, as attorney general, and you got the  message from your aide saying Bill Clinton wants to come up to the plane  and talk to you, and you know that Hillary Clinton is going to be  testifying or - not testifying but doing the interview with the FBI two  days later, what would you have said to your aide?  What should she have  done?  Should she have said, listen, I can't take the meeting?  What would  you have done?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Yes; I think that would've - look, at most you would go and say  hello to the president as a matter of courtesy and say, you know, hello.   Obviously because of the circumstances involving your wife we can't have a  conversation; or it would have been totally appropriate to simply say -  send back a message saying because of the circumstances involving your wife  it wouldn't look good for either the wife or the attorney general to have  any kind of conversation or meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; or how about having an aide on the plane?  Have you ever  seen a situation where such an important position doesn't have someone  taking notes?  There was no one else on the plane.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yes, that would not be unusual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Typically - a private meeting like that would likely occur,  where you would not have anybody on the plane. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I'm getting at, Judge, real quick, actually, have  we become incredibly politicized?  I mean, you see what happened with  Loretta Lynch on the plane with Bill Clinton.  Then you look at Jim Comey  testifying with the FBI investigation.  You look at the IRS targeting  conservatives.  What is going on?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, certainly there's the appearance of politicalization at  the Department of Justice, and that is troubling to me and that's something  that we should worry about and something the attorney general has an  obligation to address because the Department should be viewed as a  Department that operates without any kind of bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; Mr. Gonzalez, good to have you on the program.  Judge,  thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Congratulations on the book.  Be  sure to turn in tomorrow, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, and Indiana  Governor, Mike Pence my special guest.  Back in a moment; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Victims of the 2012 shooting at a Colorado movie  theatre will not be on the hook for the major legal fee.  Cheryl Casone  with that story and other headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl; thank you so much.  Coming up next, conceal  and carry getting more stylish.  How one company is helping women carry  their firearm fashionably; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Firearms and fashion, a combination that  gunmakers have ignored this for decades as they focus their marketing on  male customers.  Background checks for gun purchases hit a record high in  July and growing demand from women have created a new fashion industry.   This is amazing.  These products are designed for women, by women and they  offer a stylish look and practical way for women to carry their guns.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the owner of Nickel and Lace, Marilyn Smolenski.   Marilyn, good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARILYN SMOLENSKI, OWNER, NICKEL AND LACE:  Thank you for having me.  It's  a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you come up with this idea?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well, I was taking some classes with my husband back in 2011  and I just wasn't satisfied with any of the holsters that were on the  market.  They were all really geared towards men and men's bodies, not  women's figures, so I made my own.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We actually have one of my colleagues wearing it this morning,  I'm going to show it in a minute; but how did you get into the firearms  accessory business to begin with?  Did you see this demand out there that  you felt women needed fashion and an opportunity to conceal and carry?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes, ma'am; absolutely.  At the time most of the manufactures  were just making products smaller and turning them pink and that's how they  were marketed to women.  So there wasn't really anything for a woman's body  and for our curves and I definitely saw something, a need there on the  market for new items from women.  So I spoke to some girlfriends that were  in the fashion industry and also police officers and they were really  excited and really encouraged me to go forward with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of reception are you seeing right now at Nickel and  Lace?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Oh, just an outpouring of support.  You know, when I first  started it was kind of a taboo issue here in Chicago, as you can imagine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  -- this is where I'm based.  But, you know, as time goes on or  more people are being supportive of it, especially as the crime goes up in  the city.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us what we need to know to actually wear one of these  things.  What are the particulars and how does it work?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  So the particulars are that this is a shapewear based  foundation, so it goes underneath your clothing, and it has special use  pockets on either side, so it's ambidextrous.  It's meant for a cross body  draw for a subcompact firearm.  So, for a smaller firearm, which does hide  better on a woman's body.  If you're not going to use of firearm, in places  like Chicago you can't carry everywhere, you can also carry your cellphone,  your keys, your id. It's also what I did when I was in Europe.  I was  carrying different items so I wouldn't get, let's say, pickpocketed on the  subway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a different -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  There is a lot of different functionalities to it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has different uses.  Morgan Ortagus, who is with us this  morning, has it on.  Let's take a look.  Morgan, how does it feel?  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  I love the fact that it's  shapewear.  We were just saying backstage you could wear this underneath a  blazer and then you could see the sides, right there, where the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gun would go.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- gun, your cellphone, whatever, right here.  So, yes, it feels  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it feels like it's a shaper.  You like it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It does feel like shapewear.  I might keep it on for the rest of  the show.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well you can keep it.  You can have it if you love it.  It's  yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the next for Nickel and Lace?  Are you planning to  expand this brand -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- or are you going to stay with firearms?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  You know what, we are going to expand to a lot of things but  most things are going to incorporate firearms.  We're working on outerwear  vest at the moment, and it will have conceal carry pockets on the inside of  a fashion vest, either faux fur or suede.  We're also working on a running  belly band for runners, as well as another shape wear but with some lace  and added features to it.  So we are just plowing away with research and  development and making our products better and more useful for women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, no doubt, being based in Chicago you've seen what has  gone on there, in terms of the murders in the violence.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it must be resonating in Chicago?  People want to protect  themselves.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  It really is.  Correct.  Correct.  You know, my sales were more  out of state before, but now, with the rise in crime, I am seeing an  increase in sales, as well, here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn, we'll be watching the developments.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn Smolenski there joining us; Nickel and Lace.  And,  Morgan, you may wear this for the rest of the show?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Listen, you know, shape wear and pistols?  God Bless America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go; coming up, the fast food wars are heating up.  We  tried the Burger King Cheetos Chicken fries but that's not all the  industries doing to being in customers.  We'll talk to the former Young  Brown's founder, David Novak in the next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; good Wednesday morning, everybody.

Good to see, everybody.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  A lot to talk about this  morning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:   Definitely; I mean, the markets have really been front and center this  week, haven't they?  A lot of volatility.  So we went through this period,  Maria, a couple of months, I mean, back, really, post Brexit and then all  of a sudden the markets got crazy volatile after kind of being in a summer  slumber for a little while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is true.  And we've got mergers to talk about, as well  as these valuations plus so much on the political front.   Joining us this  morning, coming up, FOX News Military Analyst, Retired Four Star General  Jack Kean is with me; Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, Congressman John Mica; and, former U.S. Attorney General Alberto  Gonzalez joins us.  You don't want to miss a moment of it, so do stay with  us.  </p><p>We kick it off right now with our top story: Republican Presidential  Nominee Donald Trump lays out his plan for affordable child care with his  daughter at his side, Ivanka Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Child care is such a big problem.   We're going to solve that problem.  That means we need working mothers to  be fairly compensated for their work and have access to affordable, quality  child care for their kids.  That's what we're doing.  We want higher pay,  better wages and a growing economy for everybody.</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF DONALD TRUMP:  Raising children full-time is one  of the hardest jobs anyone can do and it's essential that our policies  recognize and honor that reality. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who was at  the event yesterday.  Congresswoman, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was watching you last night, taking such leadership, getting  up there on stage, taking the microphone.  I want to ask you about this  plan, whether it is a game changer, but then I also want to ask you about  the woman vote.  Areas in Pennsylvania, he needs to win Pennsylvania and he  needs that woman vote.  Talk about the plan for a second.  Is this a game  changer, when it comes to winning over more female voters go to childcare?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, Maria, it is indeed because not only is it a game changer,  but what you're doing is starting a conversation.  So this is the  conversation starter.  You're talking about options.  You're talking about  relief; how to deal with childcare and make certain that children are safe  and have access to the opportunities you want them to have and experience  is one of the top issues for working parents.  </p><p>And I think it is so important that the deductibility for those child care  expenses, being able to do that birth through 13. Stay-at-home moms also  having the opportunity to access that tax incentive that is something that  is very important.  Then when you look at the Dependent Care Savings  Account that you can use for elder care.  How many of us end up caring for  elderly relatives?  So this is a way to help offset some of that expense.  </p><p>The other thing I liked was the fact that we've always had this debate  about paid maternity leave and here is an option that is a good  conversation starter saying, go after waste, fraud and abuse and  unemployment insurance program and put it through that.  So plenty for  Capitol Hill to work on, to talk about and I think good conversation  starter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that because on the one hand there  are a lot of good things in here for mothers, for women, for families.  On  the other hand, this, sort of, goes against what the Republicans have been  talking about for a long time, and that is too much spending.  Donald Trump  came out, right off the bat in this campaign saying, we are going to  eliminate all these deductions and here we see the child care deduction.   How does that sit with you, in terms of the spending portion of this, and  how you pay for this?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, I think the big difference there is previously when you  would hear things about child care or paid maternity leave it was always a  mandate and, okay, we are going to mandate this and then the private sector  figure out how to handle it.  Now, what he is saying is, look, let's look  at the tax code and families have changed.  Work conditions have changed.   The way people have organized their family life has changed.  So, yes, it  is a family issue and let's look at the tax code.  Let's look at  incentives.  It's another option.  If you want to take advantage of it, it  is there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  So since we have this tax code, let's put this into it and use  that as a starting point and see where we get.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in one of my colleagues here because I want to  talk about the woman vote, but before we get to you, Morgan, yesterday,  Marsha, three workers were called to testify before Congressional Oversight  Committee on Hillary Clinton's use of private server.  You've worked a lot  on this subject.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, I have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They all pled The Fifth.  Listen to this, Congresswoman.  I  want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to  answer and I assert my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I respectfully decline to answer and assert my Fifth  Amendment Constitutional privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no opening statement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just found this stunning.  There's also this email,  Congresswoman that show workers in Platte River Networks, this was the  company that managed her server, they were concerned about a cover-up.  One  email says, \"Starting to think this whole thing really is about covering up  some shady stuff, I will say.\"  What's your reaction to this Congresswoman?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think somebody was pretty perceptive when they wrote that  email and the American people are finding that out now.  This is another of  the pattern of deception that you get from Bill and Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>The Clinton Foundation needs an investigation.  They did not file those  990's on foreign funds for a period of 10 years, and only did it after they  felt like they had to; and now they never filed the proper paperwork.  You  look at Lorient, you look at Frank (Inaudible); you look at Uranium One;  you look at what happened with Russia.  I just -- the Nicaraguan land deal;  I mean, Maria, this goes on and on and on. </p><p>One of the things I've heard about from people, also, is the string of  emails that show people that donated to the Clinton Foundation would then  go back through and ask preferential treatment, via the State Department,  with passports, with visas, things that people have to deal with if they  want to travel.  So they thought since they were giving Clinton Foundation  money, they were entitled to a preferential treatment.  That really - you  know, people don't like that and they are very curious about really  happened there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is getting extraordinary by the moment.  It's actually  incredible.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Stickier every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Every day.  So you've got this happening on the Clinton side  and then Donald Trump trying to appeal to women.  Morgan Ortagus, do you  think this situation is resonating with women and do you think this child  care proposal is going to lure in that vote? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I do.  I think that I'm the age demographic that Donald Trump  should be going after.  I'm 33 years old, married, woman working in New  York.  When they put Ivanka on stage, every time I'm impressed with her.  I  think a lot of young women are.  So if Kellyanne Conway can convince Ivanka  to go onstage between now, every day until Election Day, I think it will be  a smart thing for the campaign because these are the issues that women my  age are facing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  How do we have a career?  How do we raise children?  But what's  really important, and I think the Congresswoman made a great point, it  wasn't just that we are mandating to business, Trump offered a plan to pay  for that, and that's important, I think.  Whatever we do for business going  forward, there has to be a plan to pay for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, what about this New York Attorney General now,  opening an inquiry into the Trump Foundation just as President Obama, by  the way, yesterday took to the campaign trail?  He slammed Donald Trump.   He's stumping for Hillary Clinton.  Listen to this, Congresswoman.  We have  to get your reaction here too.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  You want to debate foundations and charities?  One  candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world.   The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his  charity and then bought a 6-foot tall painting of himself.  I mean - you  know -- he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but - </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in response, Donald Trump tweeted out, \"Why isn't President  Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?\"  Congresswoman  Blackburn, what impact do you think this inquiry from Schneidermann's  office will have on Trump's campaign?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  You know, it's very interesting, Maria.  I think it's going to  raise more questions about the Clinton Foundation.  And the President's  inappropriate remarks yesterday listening to him, my goodness, why don't  you look at what happened with HIV drugs in Africa and the link there with  some of the India pharmaceutical companies and some of the drugs that  really probably -- there are just a lot of questions on that issue, of what  happened with those HIV drugs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- and the association there.  So I know that there is more  information on that and it is a debate that is going to move forward and I  think Hillary Clinton is really in trouble.  </p><p>I was on the ground in New Hampshire on Saturday; it's a 1-point race  there.  And this all adds to the discussion of my, goodness, you cannot  trust Bill and Hillary Clinton.  She is a liar.  She is untrustworthy.  The  actions of their Foundation show that and I think that what I've heard and  read on Twitter, social media, people are saying why aren't they  investigating the Clinton Foundation?  You've got people sitting in those  witness chairs in D.C. that are saying well, I didn't have a security  clearance and I worked on the server and they see this as being unfair and  they see a lot of inequity of the system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, when I was watching a video last night, of all of them  saying, ten times, under the advice of counsel I'm not going to answer any  questions -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I thought to myself, well, we know these guys destroyed  emails.  We know -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Connect the dots for me?  How does that happen?  We know  already that they destroyed emails and yet they're allowed to just take the  Fifth and we are done.  I mean, is it done?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, -- but here is the thing, we are not done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They know they are guilty so that is why, yes, they took the  Fifth.  People want to know more about what has happened with the Clinton  Foundation.  How did they go for ten years and not file 990's and take that  foreign money?  Bill Clinton now saying, you know, when Hillary becomes  president we are going to stop taking foreign donations.  That's like, you  better line up now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Make contributions now.  That's kind of the altar call, if you  will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  So, I think people see through this.  They know what they get  with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and I don't think the American people want  another four years of that, quite frankly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, good to see you.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you, Maria; thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn there.  Coming up next taking a  look at this dramatic moment caught on a surveillance camera, a man plowing  into three police officers with his car at a Phoenix gas station; details  on the disturbing incident next.  Then, skyrocketing EpiPen prices, even  higher paydays at Mylan.  Next, we will tell you how much more Mylan  executives were paid than their peers at much larger pharmaceutical  companies; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, an Arizona man reportedly drives his car into  three police officers at a gas station on purpose.  Cheryl Casone with the  details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, on purpose; that's the key phrase  in this story, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, really interesting numbers there, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.   Coming up next, the State Department now admitting that the Iran Nuclear  Deal may be to blame for the worsening tensions with the country; more on  the consequences coming next.  Then, Bayer set to acquire Monsanto, $65  billion deal.  We are looking for the confirmation any minute now.  Take a  look at who benefits from this tie-up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An imminent deal on the horizon; Bayer closing  in on a $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  That was first reported by  FOX Business Network's Charlie Gasparino.  The merger expected to be made  official this morning.  After months of wrangling, the deal would be the  largest of 2016, in terms of M&amp;A.</p><p>Joining us right now on the phone is FOX Business Senior Correspondent  Charlie Gasparino.  Charlie thanks for calling in.  Break down what we know  so far. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FBN CORRESPONDENT, via telephone:  $128 a share; a lot  of people thought it would be about $130.  It's not.  It's right below  that.  It's an all-cash deal, which was very enticing to Monsanto board  members, and I think this is like what got it over the hump.  As you know,  they've been wrangling about this since March.  We actually broke when it  first became public that Bayer was interested and that they had made an  official bid back in May, so this tells how long it's been going on.  </p><p>But this was the clincher, I believe, a $2 billion breakup fee.  So that  means if regulators, and I will tell you, there's a lot of regulatory talk  about this.  This will get intense regulatory scrutiny.  If regulators nix  this thing, Monsanto gets a $2 billion check.  I think that's what put it  over the top.</p><p>Now, if you look at the share price this morning, even - you know, the deal  hasn't been announced but I mean, I guess we are pretty much -- we know  what's going on.  It's six hours difference between here and Germany.  So  you can expect this thing to be announced, officially, very soon. </p><p>If you notice, the price is not - is nowhere near $128.  I think that  reflects two things: (1) the deal hasn't been announced, and, you know,  it's never a deal until you see the press release; but I think the even  bigger concern is the regulatory scrutiny.  You've got E.U. regulators,  U.S. Justice Department Antitrust are going to be all over this.  This  deal, as you said, is the biggest deal of the year but, you know, to just  think about all of the various chemical and agricultural products that both  companies bring to the table.  I mean, this is going to be a huge  undertaking, taking these two companies and putting them together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  So that's why the deal is not trading, that plus it's never a  done deal until you see it in writing but I think the regulatory concerns  have investors a little freaked out right now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Charlie, on that note, what do you make of the regulatory  environment that's out there now.  I mean, you mentioned the Department of  Justice and some of the other regulators got in the way of the Office Depo  and Staples issue, or at least the merger there.  I mean, what do you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pfizer-Allergan.  </p><p>MARTIN:  You can go on.  I mean, Charlie, what do you think about some of  these deals going forward, not just this one but other ones that may come  out here, where companies may talk to each other but not go through with  things?  What do you make of how things are, regulatorily, with regard to  some of these deals that are out there?</p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, I mean, if you notice the E.U. has been pushing back on  some of these cross-border agriculture deals.  I mean, there's a few of  them that are out there right now.  DuPont, I believe, has one that's being  held up and, you know, this is a big concern.  Listen, there are two  complicating matters here: (1) it's two huge companies.  I mean, Monsanto  is one of the biggest U.S. companies out there.  Bayer is this huge  conglomerate in Germany.  So you have two sets of regulators, not just one.   You have U.S. Antitrust.  You have E.U. regulators.  </p><p>You know, that's what the markets say, and I can tell you that when this  thing is done and you start talking to investment bankers, you know, they  think that they got this covered.  They are going to share some noncore  assets, meaning Bayer will, and they think they are going to be able to  appease the -- appease the people.  But I will just tell you this, that's  what the New York Stock Exchange and the Deutsche (Inaudible) thought a  couple of years ago when they were looking to merge and, as you know, it  didn't happen.  </p><p>So, you know, one thing as being a journalist, I get paid no matter what  happens with this deal.  My job is just to break the deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Charlie.  We'll wait for the announcement.  You know  what's interesting, I think, the E.U. looks at deal-making differently than  the U.S. does.  The E.U. is trying to protect competitors.  So if this deal  is too big to take market share from competitors, it actually -</p><p>MARTIN:  Exactly, and that's the whole issue and I think that's what's  dangerous about this deal and some of the other ones that have been rumored  to be in the works, it's how the E.U. comes into play here, given that  they're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see about that.  We're going to take a short break.   Still to come, President Obama wants to admit 25,000 more refugees into the  country now, more than the 85,000 who have already arrived this year.  The  national security concerns front and center when we come right back.  Mike  Baker is going to weigh in on that.

Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  As much as we would like to see  Iran's behavior change in the region, we've not seen a significant shift.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But you can't rule out that, in fact, this deal has  served as a cause for this more aggressive posture?</p><p>TONER:  I mean, I can't rule that out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This marking the first time any senior U.S. official has  acknowledged Iran's behavior is actually worsening.</p><p>Joining me right is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.  General  Keane, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Good to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last time we were together, we spoke about Iran testing the  limits, testing Islam.  It's provoking the United States in the wake of  this Iran deal.</p><p>Now we hear from the administration, are they finally realizing this deal  was a mistake or what do you think is going on now given what we have seen  from Iran against our military in the last several months?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, they'll never admit that the nuclear deal was a mistake  because it was seminal objective of the Obama administration's foreign  policy.  So that's going to stay on the table.</p><p>They're going to claim that this is a good deal.  They were incredibly  naive because they also believed that the deal somehow in terms of a  strategic objective would motivate and inspire the Iranians to join the  international community of nations and behave reasonably like other nations  in the region do.</p><p>That was always nonsense.  No one believed that that would happen.  The  Iranians have been since 1980, Maria.  The strategic objective is not a  nuclear weapon.  The strategic objectives is domination of the Middle East  and they have never come off of that.</p><p>To do that, drive the United States out, weaken the relationship between  the United States and the Sunni Arabs and that's what bullying the United  States is about and trying to humiliate us is to weaken our relationship  here with the Sunni Arabs.</p><p>Are they emboldened by the nuclear deal?  You bet you they are, they got  what they wanted.  You know, the deal, Maria, legitimizes them within their  own country among their own people.</p><p>It's doubtful we will ever see July 2009 repeated again with that movements  in the streets of Tehran trying to overthrow that regime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So OK, we've got obviously a few more months of President  Obama's presidency where he's not going to do anything.  What do you want  to see in the next administration regardless of who it is, General, in  terms of the Iran relationship?  What should be done?  Are we supposed to  just take this taunting and bullying from the Iranians on our military men  and women?</p><p>KEANE:  I think things will change almost dramatically regardless of who is  president because I believe for a long time and I think you see it in the  behavior of the Iranians, Russians, Chinese that we have a weak president  and this empty rhetoric and they can take advantage of this president.</p><p>Clearly what must happen is the United States has to reengage in the Middle  East.  We have to get back involved with our Sunni Arabs.  We have to have  a strategic alliance and recognize that Iran is the number one adversary  from a nation's states perspective in the Middle East.</p><p>And they are threatening the stability and security of the Middle East and  therefore threatening the economic and prosperity and well-being of the  global marketplace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's really extraordinary, actually.  The Obama  administration, now this, General, it's announcing new plans to raise the  number of refugees admitted to the United States in 2017 by 30 percent.</p><p>So we are talking about 110,000 refugees in 2017.  The administration  already called for 85,000 and they're already here.  Some of these refugees  will be coming through Syria, does an increase in migrants correlate to an  increase in terror threats?</p><p>KEANE:  Not necessarily but it certainly is an increase in the level of  security that we have to have.  We -- so our viewers understand, we  traditionally take in 70,000 to 80,000 refugees.  Now refugees are not part  of the normal immigration process.</p><p>These are people who are seeking asylum largely because of political  oppression and when it comes to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, some are  literally coming because of survivability particularly out of Syria.</p><p>What I think we should do if we are going to increase the numbers coming  out of Syria, bring in the Homeland Security immigration folks, we just  brought in ten thousand of them.</p><p>I think it has gone largely better than most expected, but I would still  like to see those officials come before the Congress and explain this  program and how they have strengthened it.  And make certain that if we are  going to increase those numbers out of Syria that we are not going to have  any concerns.</p><p>What they have taken in as I've been told by people involved in the process  is largely families, some who have been tortured, some who have been  displaced and some have illnesses, et cetera, if that is going to continue,  we should be OK.</p><p>But I think that Congress deserves as representatives of the American  people to see the details of that so we are clear that we are going to be  able to protect the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, do you have confidence in the vetting process?  You  know, over the last six, eight months we have been talking about the fact  that ISIS has been very clear, they have a passport-making machine, they're  going infiltrate the refugee flow, they have done it in Europe.  What's  your confidence level when it comes to the vetting process in the U.S.  right now?</p><p>KEANE:  That's a great question.  Well, first of all, there is a problem in  Europe and because there is no process there.  Second, ISIS has said that  they will infiltrate.  I do believe, Maria, take some credit here.</p><p>I think the attention that the media has placed on this issue particularly  Fox in reporting this and getting the Congress heavily engaged in this has  forced the administration to get into the details of this maybe a little  bit more than what they would have for these Syrian refugees.</p><p>And I think they're sort of all in on this thing to be frank about it.  So  I don't have the concerns now that I had months ago because I believe  anecdotally the feedback is this has gone pretty well.</p><p>Look at, this refugee program in general which have been going on for  years, we have never had a single one of them that I'm aware of them ever  commit a terrorist act.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a great point and obviously the media,  certainly, Fox has been reacting to viewers, OK, I mean, that's why we are  focused on it because we are hearing from viewers.</p><p>In the face of all of this, General, we have North Korea.  So I want to get  your take on the weapons there.  Experts are saying that the country will  have enough nuclear material for 20 bombs by the end of this year, 20  bombs.</p><p>North Korea just conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test, as you know  that was last week, what responsibility does the U.S. have in relation to  North Korea's nuclear program?  What should be the response?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  This is a Soviet challenge.  We credited North Korea  somewhere around six to seven bombs.  Now they are going to be up to 20  because of their enhanced enrichment capabilities that they have.</p><p>They've got a couple of facilities to do that and we have classified ways  to sort of monitor that activity.  That's how we can come up this with  number, so to speak.</p><p>Nuclear weapons, what is North Korea up to with these nuclear weapons?   Clearly they want to build a missile capable of having a nuclear weapon on  that they can reach the United States.  Are they really going to attack the  United States?  I doubt that.</p><p>So what is going on?  Nuclear weapons have always been about regime  preservation, this regime, third generation, that's all they care about.   They suck this country dry just to take care of themselves.</p><p>It's a brutal repressive regime and that's all they care about.  They look  at Saddam Hussein, if he had nuclear weapon, he would never been deposed.</p><p>They looked at Gaddafi, if he had a nuclear weapon, she would have never  been deposed and that's why they want this nuclear.  Now they threatened  the use of these nuclear weapons offensively I believe mostly for  geopolitical and economic leverage.</p><p>And to make certain that South Korea is never ever going to think about  unifying that peninsula and making a one Korea out of that peninsula.  I  think largely what scares us or concerns us, this guy is a nut.</p><p>He's not a rational actor like the Soviet Union was, who had dangerous  nuclear weapons for years and was an adversary.  So that's why we've got so  much concern.  We don't have rational actors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's very interesting.  I did not realize it was  largely about staying in power.  General, thanks so much.  Such great  insight always from you.  We appreciate your time this morning, sir.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, parents of students in Detroit giving the city schools a poor  report card, they are suing Governor Rick Snider and education officials  for the failing states of the public schools in Detroit.</p><p>And then Oprah's portfolio taking a hit as shares of Weight Watchers have  plummeted.

Now confidential medical information from  U.S. female athletes who competed at the Rio Olympics has been posted  online.  Cheryl Casone with the story and headlines now.  Cheryl, good  morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  Well, the athletes  include gymnast, Simone Biles, tennis players, Serena and Venus Williams  and basketball player, Alena Deladon (ph).  The World Doping Agency said a  Russian cyber espionage group called \"Fancy Bears\" hacked its database and  revealed records of exemptions, which allowed athletes to use banned  substances because of a verified medical need.</p><p>Here is what Simone Biles tweeted.  She said that she is taking drugs to  treat ADHD since she was a kid.  Her tweet says, \"Please know I believe in  clean sport and have always followed the rules and will continue to do so.   This fair play is critical to sport and very important to me.\"  She has a  very good attitude about all of this, we should say.</p><p>Parents of Detroit school children are suing Michigan Governor Rick Snyder  saying their kids lack a fighting chance.  The lawsuit claims the state  deliberately has failed to provide necessary tools to provide a good  education.</p><p>Lawyer for the students say that it's the country's first federal case that  pushes for literacy as a right under the U.S. Constitution.  The suit seeks  a number of remedies including evidence-based literacy programs and a  system to monitor conditions that deny access to literacy.</p><p>And finally this, a new study finds credit card agreements are just too  hard for most Americans to read.  Creditcards.com says they're typically  written at the 11th grade reading level and half of Americans read at of  ninth grade level or below.</p><p>Creditcards.com analysed more than 2,000 credit card agreements about 45  percent of cardholders surveyed, Maria, said they never, hardly ever read  their credit card agreement.  And I bet if you ask most of them, they would  have no clue what their interest rate is on those cards.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  Well, it's all the fine print, Scott Martin?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, by all the debt, they've been  ranking up.  I think Cheryl is right.  They don't understand the APR  because clearly a credit card debt being on the rise here and a lot of  folks unfortunately over leveraging and making minimum payments, but still  carrying balances and therefore getting charged on interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get back to another story that Cheryl brought us and  that is this doping scandal and this hacking.  Mike Baker, I mean, it  happens all over and now we have another e-mail dump, what's your take on  this?  Should we be worried?</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER:  Well, we should be  worried, but you know, what we also have to realize is this is not  something new.  We are talking about it now, but this has been going on for  years.  We are a little bit slow on getting to the game.</p><p>I mean, Congress is still trying to sort out some legislation.  The  Pentagon still doesn't really have a protocol for what is a cyber warfare.</p><p>So in a sense the horse has left the barn, we lost a lot of information  through economic espionage, to state sponsored, and China is the number one  sponsor of this sort of activity in cyberspace.  Russia being number two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It keeps coming from Russia, though, it feels like.</p><p>BAKER:  Well, I does.  I mean, because Russia's got a lot of what they call  persistent threats.  They are not necessarily state sponsored, but they are  sudo state sponsored so there's a cut out there and there is claim of  disconnect between the government and these various hacking groups.</p><p>So this one that went after the doping federation is an example, \"Fancy  Bears,\" which has no connection to Carebears which is a great -- </p><p>MARTIN::  I guess that \"Fancy Bears\" is like a rogue part of like the  Carebears -- </p><p>BAKER:  That would make a great -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Is there any collaboration between Russia and China with all of  these hacks?  I mean, it's hard to track these guys sometimes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a fine question because actually at the end of the  day they all hate each other.  I mean, I don't -- </p><p>BAKER:  We sometimes forget that here.  Each country acts in its own best  interest.  General Keane is fantastic in talking about Iran, and he was  very clear about this.  Iran is emboldened by this nuke deal.</p><p>We looked at the nuke deal or the administration did as if somehow we were  going to be on the same agenda and what the current administration seems to  forget is that each nation acts in its own best interest.</p><p>So Russia acts in its own best interest.  There is no cooperation between  them and China.  Is there a cooperation between China and North Korea?   There is to some degree.  The North Koreans have been trained into high  level by Chinese agents.  And so there is a connection there to some degree  -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Similar interests and geographical area.</p><p>BAKER:  But what we're seeing from the Russians, this \"Fancy Bears\" group  that went after the doping federation is the same that went after the DNC.   But there are a number of these groups and to say that somehow they're  completely separate from the Russian government would be naive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, all right, we want to talk more about that this morning.  I  have to get your take on the increasing expectations of numbers of refugees  coming into the country.</p><p>Take a short break, more from our panel coming up and then Google helps you  complete your search request, right, but also may be influencing your vote,  how the search engine could be favoring one candidate.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Google's auto complete is bias in favor of Hillary Clinton.   That is what recent research from Sputnik News suggest.  Google reportedly  suggest only positive search results for the Democratic presidential  candidate.</p><p>Joining me right now the man behind the article, senior research  psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  Technology, Dr. Robert Epstein.  Dr. Epstein, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>DR. ROBERT EPSTEIN, AIBRT SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST:  Well, thank you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, most people when they use Google they are not  expecting it to get political.  So tell us what your findings suggest?</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, there are a little shocking, we did an experiment to see  what happens when you show people negative search suggestions like  something about Hillary's health or Donald Trump's flip-flops or things  like that.</p><p>And what we found is that negative search suggestions attract a tremendous  number of clicks especially for undecided voters, undecided voters will  click on a negative search suggestion about 15 times as often as they will  click on a neutral search suggestion.</p><p>So a simple way to kind of rig an election is suppress negative search  suggestions for your favorite candidate, but to allow negative search  suggestions for the other candidate.  And there's a lot of evidence that,  in fact, Google has been doing exactly that for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We know that the founders and senior leadership are fans  of Hillary, I mean, Eric Schmidt, and the founders of the company as well,  but they -- they have said, look, this is auto complete and this is not --  this is not something that we can control, so what's the answer to that?</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, we looked at that carefully and what we found is in fact  their suppressing all negatives for Hillary Clinton, but they're not doing  that for other people, prominent people including Donald Trump.</p><p>So there does seem to be bias there, not only that, the numbers are big  because we estimate that this manipulation alone will shift somewhere  between 800,000 and 3.2 million votes in November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, Mike Baker, this is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>BAKER:  It is extraordinary.  When you talk in light of the previous story  about Russian hacking, and you talk about what's the game plan behind the  Russian hacking of the DNC in the electoral infrastructure, in part it's  possibly to damage the trust in the system.</p><p>You see something about this that the doctor is talking about Google and it  has in the sense same impact once it becomes public, once people are aware  of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who do you trust?</p><p>BAKER:  Right, exactly, who do you trust?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, Dr. Epstein, what should we be doing about this?   Obviously we want to make sure people understand that there's a capability  to do this.</p><p>EPSTEIN:  The problem is that our research also show that generally  speaking, people can't see this kind of manipulation.  You know, they are  just -- you know, they are acting very smoothly.  They are getting some  suggestions, they are clicking on something.</p><p>Basically people are unaware and especially in search rankings people are  entirely unaware of any kind of manipulations there.  And if you manipulate  search rankings to favor one candidate that can shift 2.6 million and 10.4  million votes with no one being aware and no paper trail.</p><p>MARTIN:  Because it comes to the top page.  You not only get the  autocorrect, but you get the story at the top.  How many times you Googled  something and you go to the top five and pick the story out of the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, we know that Google is denying this, Dr. Epstein,  but we also know when it comes to like Facebook, the founder just gave  money $20 million to Hillary.  So I mean, some are being clear about who  their candidate is.</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, there's no question that there's favoritism here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Epstein, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate  it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I had Cheetos-covered chicken finger, and I've modeled  Shapewear for concealed carry, so, I think like -- God bless America today,  this has been a great show -- </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a good day for you -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  It has -- </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER OPERATIVE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY &amp; PRESIDENT,  DILIGENCE:  Scott and I are still waiting to model the Shapewear. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  I'm just so upset -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Try it on. </p><p>BAKER:  It depends on the concealed carry -- </p><p>MARTIN:  I'm just upset I missed the White Sox thing, you know, I'm from  Chicago, it looks like they had some dogs, and I guess the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes --  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a rough season -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MARTIN:  For the White Sox -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, but not for the Cubs. </p><p>MARTIN:  Rough, seasoned dogs, the day I call -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, got it, got it -- </p><p>BAKER:  That might have been -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for -- except you get choke ever.</p><p>BAKER:  He's appearing here twice nightly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a can't-miss lineup coming up, stay with us this hour.   Former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior adviser Mark Penn with  us this morning.</p><p>And the former Chairman and CEO of Yum! Brands David Novak joining us.   Plus, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney will be along, so, you  don't want to miss a moment of it, do stay us. </p><p>We kick it off this hour on the campaign trail.  President Obama steps into  the campaign for Hillary Clinton who plans to return to the campaign  tomorrow.  Our own Blake Burman has the latest now in Washington, Blake,  good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  To you as well.  For the third day in a row,  Hillary Clinton will be off the campaign trail as she recovers from  pneumonia.  That hasn't stopped though, the Clinton team from rolling out  some high profile help. </p><p>Later today in Las Vegas, Bill Clinton will step in for his wife.  It was  yesterday in Pennsylvania standing behind a podium with Clinton slogan that  the president repeatedly launched attacks against the Republican nominee. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You want to debate who is  more fit to be our president, one candidate who's traveled to more  countries than any Secretary of State ever has, and the other who isn't fit  in any way, shape or form to represent this country abroad and be its  commander-in-chief. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Donald Trump with daughter Ivanka standing by his side unveiled  his plan Tuesday to reduce the financial burdens of childcare.  </p><p>Throughout the day though, he also continued to keep the focus on Clinton's  basket of deplorables comment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I  call you hardworking American patriots who love your country, love your  families, and want a better future for all Americans. </p><p>(CHEERS) </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, Maria, take a look at this.  The polling surge appears  to be continuing this morning for Trump, a new reading out from \"Bloomberg\"  has Trump over Clinton in the state of Ohio up by 5 points. </p><p>Now there's two things to point out here with this poll.  When it's head- to-head, it's 5 points, when they bring in the third-party candidates, it  still remains 5 points. </p><p>And secondly, Maria, this is the largest lead for Trump over Clinton in  Ohio for the entire election cycle, primary and general.  Some might say he  is peaking here at the right time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- </p><p>BURMAN:  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an incredible number, Blake, I wonder what John Kasich  has to say about that, given his stance throughout the convention -- </p><p>BURMAN:  That he hasn't endorsed him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this entire -- </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes, exactly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Election season.  Blake, thank you, Blake Burman.  Joining me  right now is former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior adviser  Mark Penn.  Mark, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>MARK PENN, POLITICAL STRATEGIST:  Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what do you think? I mean, obviously, it's been a tough  couple of weeks, we hope Hillary is well and is feeling better obviously,  that was a very scary video to see her collapse the way she did.</p><p>Do you think it was wise for her to take a few days off and rest, or does  this feed into Trump's narrative that she is not healthy to be the next  president?   </p><p>PENN:  Well, I think it was unquestionably the right decision given all the  circumstances here for her to take a couple of days off.  </p><p>Who hasn't taken a couple of days off and you know, nursed an illness in  bed and then -- and then come back and bounce back.</p><p>I think this will be a blip here, once she gets back on the campaign trail,  and I think she's going to get a tremendous welcome when she comes back  out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, probably so, from her supporters, there's no doubt.  But  let's talk about these last couple of weeks when she made this -- the  comments about deplorables, you know, criticizing half of the supporters of  Donald Trump. </p><p>And then of course, we're watching this video of her stumbling into the  van.  Can she recoup what has occurred? </p><p>PENN:  I think she can, I think the American people have seen her be a  first lady, a senator, a Secretary of State, who as the president pointed  out, traveled to an unbelievable number of countries and they've seen her  run through this campaign with enormous stamina and always able to carry  out whatever job she was doing to the absolute fullest.</p><p>So, I think this is just going to pass pretty quickly. </p><p>BAKER:  Good morning Mark, this is Mike Baker.  You've been responsible for  some very successful campaign messaging over the years.  </p><p>What do you think is the one message that during the course of these next  final two months, she needs to really focus on. </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I think unquestionably, there's a big difference between  qualifications and competence.  </p><p>And I think -- I think that's a huge gap, I think you saw the president hit  that issue.  I think also you saw some great economic numbers, you know,  come out yesterday in terms of rising incomes, better wages.</p><p>And I think that from her perspective, she's got to say that she's got a  vision for America, she's going to carry it out, she's not going to take  America down the wrong track.  Down a track of division which Donald Trump  would represent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we've been talking this morning, Mark, about who to trust,  and why you know, all of these agencies becoming politicized have just  enraged people. </p><p>And then you've got the mainstream media, it seems that they are protecting  Hillary Clinton.  I mean, \"Cbs Evening News\" edited the Bill Clinton slip- up about his wife's health.  </p><p>We want to show you the original interview, this is not what aired broadly,  but here's the original interview, look at this, Mark. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, if it is, it's  a mystery to me, and all of her doctors rarely, but on more than one  occasion over the last many years, the same sort of thing has happened to  her when she just got severely dehydrated. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, that's what was edited.  Now, we want to listen to the  entire piece of it so that you could see what \"Cbs\" edited out.  Listen to  this, Mark.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Rarely, but on more than one occasion over the last many years,  the same sort of thing has happened to her when she just got severely  dehydrated. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, initially, Mark, Bill Clinton said it happens frequently,  and then he said, well, it happens rarely.  So, they took out the first  frequently.  \"Cbs\" released a statement defending its editing of those  Clinton's response.</p><p>It said the clip in question from former President Bill Clinton's interview  with Charlie Rose ran in its entirety on \"Cbs\" this morning\", \"Cbsnews.com\"  and on \"Cbs News\"  24/7 digital streaming service.  </p><p>One clip that ran on \"Cbs Evening News\" was edited purely for time while  our deadline for the live broadcast.</p><p>What do you think about this, Mark? I mean, \"Cbs\" editing out Bill saying  Hillary frequently has health issues. </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I think they sort of ran the whole clip, I'm glad they  did ran the whole clip.  I think a slip of the tongue was a slip of the  tongue.</p><p>I don't think frequently would be an accurate characterization.  I worked  night and day with the Clintons for 13 years, and I never saw her anything  but fully able to carry out whatever job, and you know, in a very strong  and vibrant manner.</p><p>So, I think frequently was just a slip of the tongue and let's let  President Clinton make some slips of the tongue, he has before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're saying you've never seen her or heard that she does  faint? </p><p>PENN:  No. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, on the health issue, Mark, just close us out on Obamacare.   We're seeing another -- big change, and we're seeing in October, we're  expecting premiums to rise dramatically for the American people.</p><p>How is Hillary Clinton going to address a very bad environment for  Obamacare heading into the election, what's going to be a rough October. </p><p>PENN:  Look, I think healthcare is an issue that the American people trust  Hillary Clinton to really fix.  </p><p>I think if you look at every poll, she has a significant lead on the  healthcare issue, and that she's going to take a look at the problems, and  I think this is a case of obviously going back and mending some problems  that are emerging.</p><p>And I think that's what's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Baker -- </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, Mark, if you don't mind me asking.  When was the last time you  worked closely with Hillary? </p><p>PENN:  Well, you know, I was really chief strategist through 2008 and  worked with her in 2000 and 2006, and so that's when I worked very closely  with her. </p><p>BAKER:  OK, Mark, in light of these latest polls, you worried about Ohio? </p><p>PENN:  Look, I think it's a very close race, I think the upcoming debate is  going to be a really decisive event because the American public has really  not seen the two of them face-to-face and seen the contrast.</p><p>I think you saw in the primaries when people saw the contrast between  Hillary and Bernie Sanders in the first debate, it was pretty stark.  I'm  expecting they'll see a very stark contrast and that will make a decisive  difference in this race. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, yes, the debates are going to be critical, Mark.  What does  Hillary Clinton need to do to ensure that she wins that debate from your  standpoint, that first debate? </p><p>PENN:  Again, from my standpoint, I hope the first debate won't evolve  into, you know, negative personal exchanges, but will be on a higher level,  the American people deserve a good debate. </p><p>I think she's just going to get out there and show that she's got a program  for the future of America, that she's qualified, that she's ready to serve,  that she's going to bring people together rather than divide them apart.</p><p>And I think if she shows that she will beat Donald Trump.  I'm not  convinced he's got a strategy where he can win a debate using performances  that worked in the Republican primary. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a very good point, Mark, great to see you as  always, thanks so much. </p><p>PENN:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Penn joining us there.  Governor Mike Pence will join me  tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, don't miss  it, do stay with us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>Still to come, a $66 billion mega deal, the details behind Bayer, $66  billion deal for Monsanto.  Plus, Edward Snowden wants to come home, why  he's calling on President Obama to pardon him on moral grounds, next.  </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A driver plowing into police officers outside a  gas station in Phoenix, we've got the latest, Cheryl Casone with that story  and headlines now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, Maria, and we've got the video, take a  look at this.  This suspect slamming a 41-year-old sergeant and a 33-year- old officer working his first day on the job, obviously this looks  intentional.</p><p>A third police managing to get out of the way.  That policeman arrested the  attacker. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our officers is hit by the vehicle, flies about 8 feet  in the air, smashes into the front glass of the QT and goes down.  Not only  did the suspect try to run over us, but then he fought with us after that. </p><p>These officers could have easily been killed, and I thank God that we're  not planning three funerals right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  But they were seriously injured, those two.  The suspect expected  to face three counts of attempted first degree murder and two counts of  aggravated assault. </p><p>Well, you know, presidents traditionally issue a lot of pardon during their  final months in office.  And Edward Snowden wants to get in on the action.   The national security agency whistleblower has been living in exile in  Russia for more than 3 years. </p><p>Well, now, he says that President Obama should pardon him before he leaves  office next year.  Last month, Obama commuted the sentences of more than  200 federal inmates.  </p><p>Snowden says that he deserves clemency because the information that he  leaked about U.S. in British surveillance programs was morally correct, he  says and benefited the public.  Why don't you decide on that one.</p><p>And it is official, Germany's Bayer buying Monsanto for $66 billion, that  does include debt, and this deal that our Charlie Gasparino said was  imminent this morning did in fact get confirmed.  The all cash transaction  working out to $128 a share, that's 6 percent more than Bayer's original  offer back in May. </p><p>This also includes a $2 billion break up fee, Maria, here's some pre-market  action 106.10.  But, you know, like you pointed out, deals for 128 a share,  we shall see the acquisition creating one of the world's largest  agrochemical firms.</p><p>It could face though antitrust concerns, Maria, and again, as you pointed  out earlier, that might be why the stock isn't moving any higher right now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, all right, Cheryl, we'll be watching that, thank you so  much.  Mike Baker, quick comments on Snowden, will he be getting a pardon? </p><p>BAKER:  Good God, no.  This could make my head explode if I thought about  it too long.  Look, clearly, Edward Snowden's life in Russia, the bastion  of free speech and openness is wearing thin on Mr. Snowden. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>And shocking he doesn't like it, but if he comes back to the U.S. -- and I  don't mind, I hate -- great, bring him back to the U.S.</p><p>But you know what he should do, he should face justice for what he did.  I  don't stand in that group who say, he should be hanged for treason.</p><p>No, he should face justice.  And he skipped the country, he essentially  handed over an enormous amount of data to the Chinese and to the Russian  Intel services and others.</p><p>And to say that didn't happen, to say that somehow he was, you know, this  I.T. administrator -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes -- </p><p>BAKER:  Was -- who, you know, we're going to all see glorified in the  Oliver Stone movie.</p><p>To say that he was smarter than Chinese Intel service or the Russian Intel  service and others is naive at best. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm as passionate as Mike is about this issue.  I mean, we -- I  was in Saudi Arabia as a diplomat when this happened.  I saw it directly  affect the meetings we were in.  We know that we've lost people, most lives  because of it.</p><p>We've lost people who were aspiring for us.  There are proper ways in which  to blow the whistle without blowing our classified information, without  blowing Intel message, mean sources.  There're proper ways to do this.</p><p>You can go to the Congress, you can go to the chain of command, you can do  without spilling American secrets to the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And debilitating our -- and preventing our ability to go after  terrorists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, it's fair point, you know, some people debate -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Were fired up about that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some people debate on whether or not -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Hero or a criminal.  We'll take a short break, we've got more debating  coming up.  President Obama giving himself a pat on the back, why he's  taking credit for less pain at the pump.</p><p>He's attributing the move in oil to his administration.  Then the latest  addition to the fast food wars, Cheetos, the crazy combos companies are  betting on to beat the competition, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The fast-food wars taking a cheesy twist.   Burger King is unveiling its Cheetos Chicken Fries today.  The nine piece  order is covered in the cheese crust snack broiled(ph).</p><p>This is the latest marketing cook-off in the fast food industry.  Joining  me right now is the co-founder and former CEO of Yum! Brands, the parent  company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  David Novak is with us, David,  great to see you.</p><p>DAVID NOVAK, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, YUM! BRANDS:  Nice to see you,  Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And I know you are out with  a new book which we're going to talk about.  </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you're a real insider in the business.  And we -- you know,  we try all of these new products on the set and we talk about what's new  coming out of these fast-food restaurants.</p><p>What's your take on this newest food items, fast food comes -- are these  companies going to any lengths to get people in the doors? </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, I'll tell you.  One of the things that drives our category is  news.  People are looking for -- to try new things.  </p><p>So, all of us are always trying to come up with good innovation.  But you  really want to have the innovation that sticks.</p><p>I personally prefer Doritos Locos Tacos -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>The nacho piece tacos and the cornichons(ph), tacos that we have at Taco  Bell.  The Burger King has had the chicken fries for a number of years.   So, this is their effort to bring a unique image to known quantity and  we'll see what it does.</p><p>But I don't think it's a huge idea. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, give me the status-check on the industry right now.</p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's driving business and what are you seeing -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Out there? </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, I think what always drives business is innovation and news  and brands that are well positioned and outstanding operations.  In our  business, if you don't have the core operations right, making customers  happy. </p><p>You don't have a chance, but I think what -- the brands that are winning  are the brands that bring a steady stream of news to our customers and  they're well advertised and well positioned.</p><p>I think Taco Bell for example is leading our industry on that front, great  marketing, great products that people look forward to and solid operations,  that's the winning equation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you're also all about teamwork -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And showing appreciation -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For people you wrote this book, \"O Great One!: A Little Story  About the Awesome Power of Recognition\".  Tell us what you're trying to do  with this book. </p><p>NOVAK:  Well, basically, what I learned is I was running Yum! Brands,  recognition is one of the most powerful things you can do.  I call it the  secret weapon of every leader.  And it's really an awesome thing to do for  people. </p><p>I mean, the last thing you want to have happen is to go to work every day  and not being recognized for what you do.  </p><p>In fact, 82 percent of employees feel they're not recognized by their  supervisors.  So, basically, what I'm trying to do is spread the good word  on recognition. </p><p>And get leaders in the world to recognize people more and get great  results.  And this is a parable about a guy named Jeff Jenkins who run  Happy Face toy company, finds out they're not getting great results because  nobody is happy. </p><p>And it's based on experiences I had running Yum! Brands and running KFC and  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you did such an incredible job.  I remember when the  company went public and it was incredible euphoria and the growth story was  -- the runway was incredible at Yum! Brands.  So, congratulations -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Oh, thank you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it funny that it's just a little thing makes people  feel good, which is a huge motivator -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For people, and it's -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not done as -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Much as you would expect. </p><p>NOVAK:  Sixty percent, we did some national research for my new company  which is called Ogo Enterprises.  And I'm building a brand, the first  recognition inspiration brand for the amazing people in your life.</p><p>And we did some research and we found that 60 percent of people say they're  -- is motivated by recognition is money, and 40 percent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Say they'll put more energy into work if they get recognized.  Yet,  it just really doesn't happen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  And this is just a shame.  And you know, I hate it when you see  people hardworking, people in the world, really doing a great job, and what  they do isn't noticed. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People really want to get recognized -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Absolutely -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to know that you know that they're doing, you know --  they're working hard.  So, you are a motivational leader as well.  What do  you make of the 2016 presidential election and the skills that are required  to run this country. </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, well, I think what we really need is a leader that can take  people with them and bring the country together.  </p><p>I think what's going to happen this year is, you're basically going to go  into the voting booth and hold your nose and make your vote. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  So, it's a -- it's a sad time for our history but I hope someone,  someday can step up and really get this country moving in the direction it  needs to go.  And that needs to be united. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think the most important issue is for customers?  Customers of the fast food business and who are ultimately voters. </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, well, I think you know, in terms of the election --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes --  </p><p>NOVAK:  You know, I think what people want is like anything else.  You want  to be -- in our industry, you want to be proud of the brand you go into,  you want to be proud of the -- proud of the food that you make -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>NOVAK:  I think, you know, what people want to have happen is, people want  to have our country be great, and be proud of what we are and what our  leaders are. </p><p>And I think we have the ways to go in that front, but I have -- there's no  doubt in my mind that this is the greatest country in the world and we will  -- we will prevail in the end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it extraordinary that we haven't seen 3 percent economic  growth in a lot of years at this point? How would you -- </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize the back drop out there right now? </p><p>NOVAK:  Yes, I think it's a cautious backdrop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>NOVAK:  You know, I think there's cautious -- cautiousness is everywhere  you look, and there's cautious optimism, but it's -- nobody is really ready  to jump in that pool and say hey, you know we're there yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's really important, that's why this book is so  important, \"O Great One!: A Little Story about the Awesome Power of  Recognition\", congratulations on the book, David, and it's great to see  you. </p><p>NOVAK:  Nice to see you, too, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much -- </p><p>NOVAK:  OK -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David Novak there.  Up next, the PR nightmare continues for  Samsung, the outrage over the company's handling of its faulty Galaxy 7  phones. </p><p>Then this homerun is leaving baseball fans weak in the knees, check it out.   The incredible hit from one big league slugger, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Wednesday, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, September 14.  Your top stories right now,  8:30 AM on the East Coast, the economy in focus on the campaign trail, both  President Obama and Donald Trump touting their policies, how they have and  will help the American people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT:  America is stronger and more prosperous than  when we started out.  And gas is $2 a gallon.  </p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>OBAMA:  That is even -- thank you for reminding me.  Thanks Obama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're taking a closer look at the numbers straight ahead,  thanks Obama.  Mylan labs under pressure over soaring Epipen prices, and  the Wall Street Journal has new details this morning on the company's sky- high executive pay, how the company compares to the rest of the  pharmaceutical sector when it comes to compensation.  Fears over exploding  batteries, Samsung now telling users to limit charging the Galaxy Note 7,  why this is fast becoming the worst P.R. disaster since Chipotle food  crisis.  </p><p>Markets this morning, little changed but higher, as you can see, markets  are expected to extend the rally that we've been seeing, the Dow Jones  Industrial average up about 20 points right here, fractional moves but  higher.  In Europe, the tone was set positive and that is being led by a  rebound in the price of oil, the FT 100 is up a half of a percent, the CAC  quarante in Paris was higher has since reversed course.  In Asia,  overnight, declines across the board, fractional moves nonetheless but  lower, rather.

It's going to be something special like  this country hasn't seen in many, many decades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want bring in right now, Steve Moore, Trump economic advisor  and distinguished fellow -- visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.   Steve, good to see you. </p><p>STEVE MOORE, TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  Hi, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we've spoken a lot about his corporate tax rate at 15  percent.  Tell us what we should expect from the speech tomorrow. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, I think there will be a lot of focus on that tax plan because  he does really feel that's the kind of heart and soul of his economic  recovery plan.  We will -- we do have that 15 percent corporate tax and  it's available to all small businesses.  We're also going to dramatically  simplify the personal income tax system which is, you know what, the vast  majority of Americans have to comply with.  We're going to bring the rates  down, get rid of a lot of the loopholes, and make it much simpler.  I think  most Americans, Maria, will no longer -- the vast majority of Americans  will no longer have to itemize deduction.  That's going to make it a lot  easier. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We've also received some good news on the economy  yesterday, top story in the Journal today, household incomes rose.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . by more than 5 percent last year to $56,000 dollars.   President Obama is taking credit for that, listen to this, Steve Moore, I  want to get your reaction.  </p><p>MOORE:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>OBAMA:  More Americans are working, more have health insurance, incomes are  rising, poverty is falling, and gas is $2 a gallon -- thank you for  reminding me.  Thanks Obama.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve, what do you think?  Do higher household incomes and  lower gas prices help Hillary Clinton? </p><p>MOORE:  Well, first of all, let me say that I was kind of shocked when  Barack Obama wanted to take credit for $2 a gallon gasoline because he's  done everything he can to stop oil and gas revolution that's going on, just  as he shut -- he's trying to shut down our coal industry.  Maybe we should  say, thank you oil and gas industry for providing us with that trail on oil  and gas which has driven down the price of gasoline.  Now, when it comes to  income data, look, there was good news yesterday, no question about it,  that finally we saw a rise in incomes.  </p><p>But I looked at the longer term data.  I pored over this data last night,  Maria, a really dismal statistic, I would sight to you, is that what that  census bureau data shows is that you go back to -- in 2000, 15 years ago,  Maria, the average family have a higher income 15 years ago than they do  today, when you adjust for iNFLation.  This has been a long period of just  no pay raises -- and, by the way, that's the Bush era and the Obama era.   So, I think this idea of cheerleading for the economy is a little over the  top right now.  The other statistic that I found very depressing, still in  this country in the 7th year of recovery, 40 million people in America are  still in poverty or poor, that's intolerable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible. </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  Steve, speaking about the  economy, major issue in markets today is the presence of the Federal  Reserve and Janet Yellen.  Mr. Trump has talked numerous times about  removing Ms. Yellen if he happens to take office.  You have any updates for  us on that as to maybe who he would look empower in the Fed chairmanship. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, I haven't talked to him about he -- who he likes, but how  about somebody like Steve Forbes or Larry Kudlow.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOORE:  Two people who've been very, you know, close advisors to Donald  Trump.  What I believe, I think Donald Trump believes as well, is we need a  much more rules based monetary policy that is not based on the discretion  of a few people, but it's basically very signal to the markets, when we're  going to raise of rates, when we're going to cut them.  I know, Maria,  that's not going to make your job too interesting because then we can't  speculate about what the Fed is going to do all the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot to make this job interesting.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOORE:  But anyway, I do think that there will be a new Fed chairman, if --  if Donald Trump is elected president.  And, by the way, on the energy issue  that we're just talking about, you know, Donald Trump has a very pro- production policy where we can within five years, this is one of the things  he's going to talk about, within five years we can make -- United States of  America totally energy independent for the first time in half a century.   Now, every president since a Richard Nixon has promised that, but we can  actually get that done now with the amazing new technologies we have in  drilling. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big part of the story, Mike Baker. </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  Yeah.  Steve, good morning.  Listen,  I've got three little kids, and so I think that, you know, a child care,  day care is extremely important issue.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BAKER:  My concern here is the cost.  Are you confident that this is.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BAKER: . something that's not going to blow up the budget? </p><p>MOORE:  Well, just a quick story on that, because as you guys know, you  know, I helped Donald Trump put this plan together and we kind of just  about finalizing it, and Ivanka Trump of all people, you know, said, look,  we need to do something about, you know, working moms, and that are really  struggling with this day care costs, you know.  I'm a father, I'm not a  mother, I don't do the child care stuff and I could -- a lot of us weren't  really aware of how big of a problem this is for working women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE:  And so, this is something I think is going to be really popular  with voters.  And one other quick thing about this, Maria, we're also going  to offer a corresponding credit for stay-at-home moms because we felt  strongly that -- yes, we want to help working mothers with their child care  expenses, but what about the women, like my wife, who's stay at home and  take care of the kids, they need some help, too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  But, Steve, what Mike is asking, I mean, he likes you,  he's got three kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOORE:  How do you pay for it?  How do you pay for it? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain, how do you pay for it?</p><p>BAKER:  Exactly. </p><p>MOORE:  OK.  So -- I'm glad you asked that.  So, we're going to have  dramatic spending cuts in the budget, and some of those will be outlined  tomorrow, in New York.  By the way, I'll be there.  I hope to see you  there, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  I will be there actually.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, so.</p><p>MOORE:  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . what's this spending cuts? </p><p>MOORE:  So we're going to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE: . spending cuts, and then we're going to have -- and, by the way,  you know, we're going to look at all agencies of government and cut the  waste and abuse, and some of the agencies we don't need, there's hundreds  of them we're going to get rid of.  The other thing is that Donald Trump is  right about this, if you get this economy from this one to two percent  growth rot that we've been in 7 or 8 years, up to 4 percent that's our --  you know, I said this on Stuart Varney show a few weeks ago, we're going to  get 5 years of 4 percent growth with this economic program.  You do that,  you're going to get amazing amounts of revenues and you're going to be able  to balance the budget within 5 or 6 years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tomorrow we'll hear about the child care credit, we'll hear  about tax reform.</p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . we're also probably hear a bit about trade, and that's the  area of his economic plan that scares some people.  Are we going to have to  do all new trade deals, is that going to be disruptive?  Obviously, he's  talked about how he doesn't like NAFTA. </p><p>MOORE:  Well, you know, Maria, I'm a free trade guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MOORE: . I always have been.  And so, I don't always agree with Donald  Trump on this issue.  But, I think he's more reasonable on this.  I think  he's going to say, some of these trade deals you asked about which ones  need to be renegotiated, I'll tell you one that's absolutely will be and  that's Asia TPP trade deal.  And, that's not to say we're not going to have  a trade deal with Asia, it just needs to be renegotiated.  It's not in  America's interest right now.  It doesn't open up sufficiently in Donald  Trump's mind, and mine, too.  Markets to American producers, you know.   China, we open up our markets to China and Japan, they don't open up their  markets to us, and we need to get a little tougher with them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, I know, I think that's. </p><p>MOORE:  But, I don't think we're going to have tariffs, I really don't,  Maria.  I know that's the term that really scares people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MOORE:  But, you haven't heard -- you haven't heard Donald Trump talk a lot  about tariffs in the last three or four months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true, OK.  So, no tariffs, but he's going to eliminate  fraud and abuse, cut spending.  Are you satisfied on the child care? </p><p>BAKER:  Look, I mean, every presidential candidate.</p><p>MOORE:  Oh, by the way.</p><p>BAKER: . you can go back to 1931, Franklin Roosevelt, talking about  eliminating fraud and waste to pay for programs and it never seems to  happen.</p><p>MARTIN:  Famous words are it's totally paid for.  What we have heard from  Obama, year after year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>MARTIN: . didn't turn out so well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, economic growth does pay for a lot of things.  But,  Steve, there is that looming question out there can you pay for it? </p><p>MOORE:  There is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah. </p><p>MOORE:  Yeah.  And I'll just give you a couple of examples, you know, we  can cut dramatically some of these agencies like the commerce department,  the energy department, the education department, the only thing to  remember, Trump said we're going to require countries like Germany, and  France and Korea to pay more for the defense that we're providing them.  I  think that's perfectly appropriate.  You're talking about tens of billions  of dollars there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there, Steve.</p><p>MOORE:  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . good to see you, thanks so much.  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>MOORE:  The map -- out, I promise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We're holding you to it. </p><p>MOORE:  OK, see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Moore with the latest there.  By the way, tomorrow is a  big day for us, we've got Governor Mike Pence joining us, 8:30 AM Eastern,  right here on Mornings With Maria, don't miss our special interview,  tomorrow morning.  Coming up, first it was the price, now it's the pay, the  new outrage surrounding Mylan labs.  Plus, struggling to contain the  fallout, Samsung's race to restore consumer confidence following its Galaxy  7 disaster, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, 45 minutes away from the opening bell for a  Wednesday.  We're expecting a higher opening for the broader averages.  We  know that the Monsanto-Bayer deal has been confirmed, and as a result that  gave the market a bit of a boost this morning.  So, we're looking at a  broader averages opening higher today.  A couple of names on the move,  watch Mylan labs, the drug maker behind the EpiPen price increase, facing  new criticism this morning.  A  Wall Street Journal article an analysis of  compensation shows executives received the second highest compensation in  the drug and biotech sector at Mylan.  Mylan compensation out pay its peer  in the industry including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer, among other much  larger companies.</p><p>Also watching shares of Apple, reviews of the company's second series of  the Apple watch just coming out, the Journal is reporting that the devices  found purpose in life with a refined focus on fitness, it still calls it a  luxury over a necessity in the Journal this morning.  How about that PR  nightmare for Samsung, users reporting that their Samsung Galaxy phone are  exploding due to faulty batteries, the company has yet to release an  official response.  Joining me right now, the host of Varney &amp; Co., Stuart  Varney, to weigh in, wow, what a nightmare, Stu. </p><p>STUART VARENEY, VARNEY &amp; CO. HOST:  It's taken $22 billion off the value of  Samsung's stock which is only traded in South Korea, I believe.  But that's  how big it is already.  A few days ago it was 14 billion off those stocks  value, now it's 22 billion and rising.  You know, Maria, it just occurs to  me, Maria, that frequently we have to deal with major companies with a  global brand image and they run up against a P.R. disaster, Chipotle comes  to mind for food poisoning, Takata, the air bag people, exploding air bags,  Wells Fargo, even with high their executive pay, and the cheating with  customer's accounts, these are huge P.R. deals, really bad news.  And you  know it takes some of these companies a long, long time to recover.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised that Apple has not been given a shot in the arm by  the Samsung Galaxy problems that are so evident around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY:  I would have thought Apple got a better boost out of this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe they are getting a boost, and we'll see the numbers  eventually.  Anybody on the panel have a Galaxy phone that blew up? </p><p>MARTIN:  No.  But, Stu, I'll tell you, you want to talk about a P.R.  nightmare, I took a flight out from O'Hare to LaGuardia yesterday, it is  now made the airline announcements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, wow.</p><p>MARTIN: . so when they do the safety announcements, the flight attendants  said, please we also ask you to not charge your Samsung Galaxy phone if you  have one.  So, talk about the basis of the anger there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's part of the airline announcement. </p><p>MARTIN:  It is now part of the airline announcement based on my plane  yesterday. </p><p>VARNEY:  How do you recover from that?  Well, I guess you do in time as the  giant company -- but that is a P.R. disaster. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, for sure. </p><p>VARNEY:  Big time. </p><p>BAKER:  Mr. Varney, it's Mike Baker here, very good to see you this  morning, by the way.  I'm wondering how bad you think this can get for  Samsung? </p><p>VARNEY:  I think it gets even worse, actually, as these stories emerge all  around the world.  Essentially, they've got to withdraw and redesign the  battery on I think at the moment 2.5 million smartphones.  That cost a lot  of money.  You don't know how many future sale they are going to lose.  As  I said earlier, 22 billion off the value of the company so far.  That's  probably going to rise.  And who knows whether the whole Galaxy line can  recover at some point, I'm sure it will because it's a very good phone.  I  have one on the set right here, beautiful screen, all things good except  that battery.  So, I think there's worse to come, but they will stabilize  at some, but I don't know when.  And I don't know when they're going to  rebound significantly. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  Well, it is a big issue, we'll see what happens.  Stu,  we'll see you in about 12 minutes. </p><p>VARNEY:  You will. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top of the hour, Varney &amp; Co. begins at 9 AM Eastern, right  after Mornings With Maria, join Stuart at the top.  Coming up, talk about a  ballpark dog, the crazy walk -- record setting in Chicago, last night.   We're going to tell you about it, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, what happens when you get bored hitting home runs, you've  change it up a bit, 24-7 Fox News Headlines sports reporter, Jared Max, the  highlights right now, Jared, good morning. </p><p>JARED MAX, 24-7 FOX NEWS HEADLINES SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Maria, good  morning.  Now, a major league baseball player makes headlines for taking a  knee, but it's not what you think.  Check out Texas Rangers third baseman,  Adrian Beltre, last night, out to play second inning against the Astros,  down on one knee hits a home run, amazing.  The 30th homerun of the season,  Beltre also did this is in 2011 World Series.  Now, it makes the  highlights, doesn't make Beltre happy, he said, I don't like doing it but  it normally happens on breaking balls when I'm trying to fight off a  breaking ball, somehow the knee just goes down, he swings, he said I wish I  could stop doing it.  He thinks it hurts him more than it actually helps  him.  Hey, however you get it done, is more than one way to skin a cat. </p><p>Conflicting reports over whether NFL players who wears cleats this past  summer -- Sunday, I should say, to honor those lost on 9/11 will be  punished by league.  Still no official release from the NFL on this,  expected fines if there are any would total $6,000 per player, reportedly. </p><p>Over 52 million women watched the Super Bowl this past February, so why are  so few women employed by NFL teams as coaches or scouts.  Now, all 30  percent of front office workers in the NFL are women, jobs in football  operations are scarce for women, which is why the NFL has created a  position to address the leagues gender inequality in particular roles.  The  NFL named former women's football pro-tackle, Sam Rapoport, as the director  of football development.  Rapoport job, she said, is to create the pipeline  for females to enter into positions traditional held by men.</p><p>Guinness World Records set at the White Sox game last at U.S. Cellular  Field, for the most dogs at a live sporting event.  Now, you see not the  mascot, but the actually dogs.  The annual, Bark at the Park, night, a  nationwide tradition which the White Sox actually started 20-years ago.   Fans were told to be in their seats with their furry shoulders at the end  of the second inning, after all the dogs were counted.  Anybody want to  guess how many dogs were there? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't, I mean.</p><p>MAX:  Twelve hundred.</p><p>MARTIN:  You're pretty close, 1122.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I did not look at -- I did look at the teleprompter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>BAKER:  All right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twelve hundred dogs, wow. </p><p>MAX:  Eleven hundred twenty two, and they set -- they set the record, and  it was cool as the White Sox, Tyler Saladino, he had his husky, was in the  crowd as well.  And was joking that from the crowd, from the -- from the  field you could hear the dogs and the crowd, he said they were just talking  to each other, you don't know what's going on but they were just barking. </p><p>MARTIN:  Better than booing which is usually what goes on at the White Sox,  yeah.  I don't know if they even draw usually 1200 fans.</p><p>BAKER:  Do you buy your dog a hot dog when you take him to the stadium?</p><p>MARTIN:  Only if --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I really like this NFL story there, Jared.  I mean, everybody  knows I'm not sporty spice, and they make fun of me for this, and I watched  the NFL games with the halftime show.  But, I think it's great when there's  a private corporation that's taking initiative to get women to the top.   So, good for them. </p><p>MAX:  Yes, definitely.  There are -- look, 30 percent of front office jobs  as I just mentioned are held by women, 52 million women will watch the  Super Bowl, you can't tell me there are some fantastic positions that are  just waiting to be held by people who happen to be women, I don't think  that gender thing really matters anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>MAX: . people watch football. </p><p>BAKER:  Can I ask you one question?</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  How good can the Giants be, the New York Giants be this year. </p><p>MAX:  It all depends on the health I think of the wide receivers.  Victor  Cruz needs to stay healthy, and if that's the case, always such a strong  night. </p><p>MARTIN:  Sterling Shepard is a dark horse, by the way.  He is a good  player.  Good draft. </p><p>MAX:  One other thing on the baseball game.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MAX:  We haven't mention the Mets. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we have to mention the Mets. </p><p>MAX:  Half a game up for the nationals. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nat Candido.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Do not let the Mets play the Cubs again this year, because the  Cubs -- that would be the Cubs bugaboo this year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bring it on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MAX:  For the Indians last night at the U.S. Cellular Field, it was a rough  night. </p><p>MARTIN:  It's been a rough season. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.  We will leave it at that, how's that, oh ruf.  OK.</p><p>(BARKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's good, Bark in the Park.  Jared, thank you.  Jared  Max.  We've got final thoughts from our all-star panel after this short  break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel, Mike  Baker. </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  The state of Connecticut not exactly known for its fine  fiscal management currently.  That's finally announced a very good decision  which is they're bringing back the far cars on metro north, a new haven  line.  They retired these things in 2014, last rolling bar cars in the  country.  They're bringing them back.  They won't be on-line until 2018,  but it makes that commute back and forth to New York City much more  pleasant. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, you like it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BAKER:  Thumbs up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin. </p><p>MARTIN:  Market volatility is back.  And the real tell if you're investing  at home I think is interest rates.  They're starting to tick up.  When they  tick up the equity market goes down.  Watch that keep happening. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Morgan Ortagus </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm watching Syria.  The Obama administration is desperate for  the latest deal between Kerry and Lavrov, the Secretary of State for Russia  to work.  The Pentagon and the State Department are fighting over whether  we should cooperate Russian air strikes.  This is going to be really  important in Washington in the next few days. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch it as well.  Thanks everybody, great  show today.  Thank you so much for joining us, we'll see you tomorrow.   \"VARNEY &amp; CO\"., begins right now, Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, September 14.  Here are your  top stories, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Hillary Clinton off the campaign trail for a third straight day but the  questions over her private e-mail server are looming large during a  congressional hearing.  And Donald Trump is on the attack on it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  This attitude of arrogance that  explains why Hillary Clinton made 13 phones disappear including with a  hammer, so the FBI couldn't see them.  And why she bleached her e-mails  after a congressional subpoena -- that's after the subpoena came.</p><p>Now the people who destroyed the e-mails are all pleading the Fifth  Amendment in front of Congress.  Anyone watching today's hearing in  Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The latest on the race to the White House coming up.</p><p>Plus protecting your finances.

The markets are  expected to open fractionally better on the session today.  </p><p>In Europe the tone was set higher, led by a rebound in the price of oil.   FT 100 up two-thirds of a percent now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  And the Kospi in Korea  closed for a holiday.  </p><p>We've got all of those stories coming up this hour.</p><p>And joining me to talk about it Maverick PAC national co-chair Morgan  Ortagus; Kingsview Asset Management Scott Martin; and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.</p><p>Wow, what a story on Google just there.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  It's incredible.  When you do think  about what could be happening.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.   This is just saying that Google is impacting your searches on Hillary  Clinton.</p><p>Then you think, well, are they also impacting your searches on issues that,  you know, favor Hillary Clinton's point of view.  I mean this thing just  goes on and on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the refugee crisis.</p><p>BAKER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like health care.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC:  It's no surprise, Maria, that there's big  mistrust of everything in big government and big institutions and big tech.   That's why were seeing this play out in this election cycle.  People have a  fundamental lack of trust in the institutions and organizations and  corporations that seem to control our lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  They control your lives and  Google is in home, it's on your smart phone, it's on your tablet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the problem is you don't know it.  You don't realize  but you could be actually being taken advantage of.</p><p>We've got a can't-miss lineup this hour.  Stay with us.  We are about to  speak with former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, we will ask him  his opinion on this; former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign senior  adviser Mark Penn is with us; and former Yum Brands chairman and CEO David  Novak stops by as well.  </p><p>Meanwhile outrage on Capitol Hill this morning.  Three former Clinton  workers refusing to testify before a congressional oversight committee  yesterday regarding the Democratic nominee's use of a private server.   Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to  answer and observe my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I respectfully decline to answer and observe my Fifth  Amendment constitutional privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no opening statement.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper also took the stand but  he actually answered questions.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  Did you have a security clearance at that  time?  </p><p>JUSTIN COOPER, FORMER BILL CLINTON AIDE:  No I did not have a security  clearance.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  After you left the White House early in -- when did you leave  the White House?  </p><p>COOPER:  2001.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  2001.  Did you ever have a security clearance at any level after  that?  </p><p>COOPER:  No, I did not have a security clearance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Was your purpose in destroying the old Blackberry  device ever to hide Secretary Clinton's e-mails from being saved or  disclosed from federal records laws.</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman, no.  It's not in any way to destroy or hide any  information at all.  I was going out of my way to preserve all of the  information that was on those devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's why he used a hammer to destroy the device to  save it.</p><p>Joining me right now is a member of the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, Florida Congressman John Mica.  Congressman -- good to  have you on the program.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R), FLORIDA:  Good to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your takeaway from the happenings yesterday.  </p><p>MICA:  Well, I think they're trying to run the clock out.  We saw one  witness not show up, thumb his nose at Congress, two that took the Fifth  Amendment and the other we learned some information from -- this has been a  cat and mouse game from the beginning.</p><p>We started with Benghazi trying to find out what took place, who did what  and we just keep getting the stall and not the information that Congress is  entitled to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean does this just mean you are powerless in this regard?   I mean what are you going to do?  One guy, Pagliano, decides it's just not  imp.  I'm not showing up.  He blows it off.  You have the other two not  revealing anything.  And then Justin Cooper, no pushback on the fact that  he says oh no, I was trying to preserve information.  But we know he's the  guy with the hammer.  What happens now -- Congressman?  </p><p>MICA:  Again, we have to follow the law and the rules of procedure.   Pagliano did not show up.  He can be held as I questioned the chairman in  attempt of Congress.  A referral would then go to the Department of Justice  and there could be proceedings, criminal proceeding possibly against him.</p><p>Right now were looking at the options.  I don't know if the chairman will  give him another opportunity to come forward.  I don't know whether there  are other remedies from a legal standpoint we have.</p><p>But again, you see a stalling game.  This guy played the same thing with  the FBI.  We think he was granted immunity, we don't know to what extent.   But he should have at least showed up if he wanted to exercise his right  like the other two did, he could take the Fifth Amendment before us.</p><p>But again this is just a continuum of stalling; failing to give Congress  the information we are entitled to.  We are entitled to conduct a thorough  investigation.  Our committee has charge over all matters for  investigations under the House of Representatives.  And they are thwarting  that process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning -- Congressman.  Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass  by the FBI.  We know this already.  But can you tell me what is going on  with her top aides?  Are you still investigating them in Congress?  We saw  last week on the show that immunity was granted to yet another person on  the server even though we thought the investigation was closed.</p><p>What is going on with the people who are actually in control of this  information of this e-mail?  We haven't really heard and I think the  American people would like to know what is happening to those people in  power. </p><p>MICA:  Well, we heard from one witness a little bit of information.  We are  trying to gather all the facts because you can't proceed without the facts.   Some information we did learn and we seized from some of the FBI 302s.</p><p>It appears that people like Cheryl Mills, one of the aides to the secretary  possibly ordered some of the destruction of the (inaudible) that should  have been preserved.  We have a requirement to preserve records even though  she had them on a private server.  She had classified information and other  information that wasn't properly turned over and may have been destroyed.</p><p>So we're trying to find out what took place.  And every time we turn to  another witness, we find out there is more.  When they talk to the FBI they  suddenly dump new found e-mails.  It is a stall to try to run out the  clock.  And we are, I think entitled to complete the investigation in a  proper and thorough manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Here's Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Congressman -- good morning.  There used to be a sense that  there were consequences for action.  And I think there is a frustration out  there in the American public that perhaps things just go to the Hill and  die nowadays whether it's the Benghazi investigation or any other  investigation regardless of where on the political spectrum it stands.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  IRS.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes -- IRS.  What is your timeframe for this particular situation  where Brian Pagliano ignores a subpoena, doesn't show up.  You know, I  realize you have to follow procedures but you're also Congress.  And do you  have the ability to move at your own pace here and what will your timeframe  be to deal with that?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, unlike some here, we do comply with the constitution with the  constraints imposed on us.  Even Congress has constraints.  So we can't go  and prosecute.  Now we have to see again what was done in contravention of  the law and the rules, take the steps that are allowed under the law.   Unfortunately we have a Department of Justice whether it's been Loretta  Lynch or Holder that are non-responsive and turned a blind eye.</p><p>We have a very difficult situation, a very difficult job.  But, you know,  this is kind of like that old law enforcement serial on TV.  All we want  are the facts ma'am.  And our job is to get the facts for the public and  then take action.  But we have to do that.</p><p>If they want to be lawless our side of the aisle is not going to be.  We  want to comply with the law and the proper procedures.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But when you say they're trying to, you know, wipe the clock  out, you know, let the clock run out does that mean that they're going to  just let the clock run out until the end of the couple of months and let  the election happen and then they're hoping Hillary Clinton wins and then  it just dies and goes away because she's president.  Is that what you're  saying?  </p><p>MICA:  Well, again, they already have control of the Department of Justice.   It appears the FBI may have been compromised from there.  And it's much  disappointing with the Director Comey who has had a fairly good reputation  not to give us the information.  You may recall during the hearings I said  the secretary and her interview recorded.  No.  Do you have any information  from that?  Yes we have the 302s.  We still don't have the 302s from that  and some have been kept from us.</p><p>They are playing a cat and mouse game whether it's the Department of  Justice, now the FBI.  It's a very sad time for our judicial system and the  process that should move forward in an orderly manner under the  constitution laws of the United States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What a disgrace for the American people if all of these  agencies have become compromised and politicized at this point.</p><p>Congressman -- thanks very much for your insights.  We appreciate this.</p><p>MICA:  Good to be with you.  We will continue this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so will we.  John Mica -- joining us.</p><p>Go ahead Mike Baker.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  I think that was very interesting what he just said.  It was  almost a throwaway comment where he said that the FBI may have been  compromised as well.  What I would say is I don't know Director Comey's  motivation for his decision that he made recently.  I will say this.  I've  had the good fortune of working with the FBI over the years including  recently and I know some of those folks.  The agents there at the FBI, they  are not compromised.  This is not an issue regarding the agents or the FBI.</p><p>This is -- and again, not knowing what Director Comey's concerns are --  DOJ, is it political?  Of course.  But the FBI -- those folks do their job  and investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know some FBI agents, too and I agree with you.  They are -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Look at all the evidence we dug out.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened to Jim Comey?</p><p>BAKER:  You know what, it's a question I don't know where we're going to  get an answer to.  And it surprised a lot of people.  You remember the talk  in Washington was all before his decision.  He's a great.  He's completely  nonpartisan.  He is the most nonpartisan person there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the interview was not recorded.  The interview wasn't  on the record.  Basically her lawyers told the FBI look, if you record this  she's not showing up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok, we won't record.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  And he let Loretta Lynch off the hook two days after she met on a  private plane with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes.</p><p>BAKER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain that to us.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's as political as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk about this tomorrow as well when we have a  special guest.  Governor Mike Pence will join us tomorrow, 8:30 a.m.  Eastern right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Don't miss our special  interview tomorrow coming up with Governor Mike Pence.</p><p>Still to come: as Hillary rests, President Obama is on the attack.  The  details as he hits the campaign trail.  We'll tell you the reception that  the President got as he stumps for Hillary.</p><p>Plus move over buffalo.  We are testing Burger King's new Cheetos chicken.   How's that for breakfast?</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 releasing more DNC documents. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with that and the headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.</p><p>Well, Guccifer 2.0 disclosed the documents at a cyber security conference  in London yesterday.  They include the Democratic National Committee's  finances and network infrastructure.  Among them Democratic vice  presidential candidate Tim Kaine cell phone number and the contact  information for several top White House officials.  U.S. intelligence  officials suspect Russian involvement.</p><p>Well, if you upgraded your Apple device to the latest IOS software  yesterday and you didn't have a problem.  You were one of the lucky ones.   Some people were hit by a major bug that left their devices temporarily  useless.</p><p>There are reports that some of the upgrades resulted in a so-called bricked  iPhone or iPad.  Basically when that happens your device has a black screen  and access is totally blocked.  Those unlucky people had to plug the  devices into their computers, connect to iTunes and restore their devices  completely.  This is why you should always backup your phone, folks.  Apple  acknowledging the problem; they later did say that they had resolved it.</p><p>And finally, we first told you about this new item from Burger King  yesterday, Cheetos Chicken fries.  But they're out today.  You have to eat  lunch at some point right.  So before we dive into them on set because, of  course, I brought them, we should tell you that the fries are made with all  white meat chicken.  They are covered in a flavored breading that includes  crushed up Cheetos.  Nine-piece order, $2.89 Maria and for all of you  watching your waistlines one order is 280 calories.</p><p>And I brought them to try because I think we should try things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm supposed to believe that this is 280 calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  280 calories -- would I lie to you Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If only our viewers can smell what I smell on this set right  now -- wow.  </p><p>MARTIN:  What's the calorie count?  Is the calorie count per the order?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is 280 calories.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You can taste the Cheetos.</p><p>CASONE:  You can taste the Cheetos?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm from Florida, ma'am.  We love our junk food.  The taste is  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you taste any chicken?</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the breakfast of champions, baby.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just tasty.</p><p>MARTIN:  If you have this with the Red Bull and Vodka in the morning your  day is set.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER:  I'll tell you what, that's the breakfast of champions right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While you're enjoying your breakfast, ladies and gentlemen, let  me tell you we do have breaking news.</p><p>Bayer is acquiring Monsanto -- the deal is done, Scott Martin as we  expected.</p><p>MARTIN:  Have fun with the regulators on that one.  I mean they blocked so  many of this, this year.  It's good to see this being done.  What's funny  about this deal too, Maria, agriculture.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Agriculture prices have been falling through the floor.  So it's  interesting to see these two companies get together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $128, $128 a share.</p><p>BAKER:  You know what's interesting also is what Charlie Gasparino reported  earlier which is if the EU or DOJ or both decide to nix this deal, Monsanto  walks away with a $2 billion check.  And a lifetime supply of chicken  fries.  It's a good deal for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at this, the deal is at $128.  The stock is still at $106.   So go figure.  Why is that $128?</p><p>MARTIN:  I think the market does not trust the regulators.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they don't think -- somebody doesn't trust -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  This is the biggest deal of 2016, boys and girls and so, of  course, the regulators are going to get involved in this.  They're not  going to let this just walk through.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, you've got to get through the Europeans and the Americans.   It's not just the American regulators.  It's the EU which is just so  efficient.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BAKER:  Is everybody else eating these chicken fries?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN:  Mike's almost out of chicken fries.  He knows that -- </p><p>BAKER:  I'm going to have yours and yours.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- chicken fries so fast.</p><p>CASONE:  There's honey -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  280 calories -- Scott.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I like this one.  This one is zesty and has horse radish.  So  it's good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I think the 280 does not include the sauce.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we hear new information -- Cheryl.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you-- Burger King.</p><p>BAKER:  And your fingers are not covered in Cheeto dust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  I hope you're having breakfast at home with us.</p><p>Wells Fargo's phony account scandal putting fraud in the spotlight -- what  you need to protect your money.  </p><p>Plus making a smart home a reality -- the big name Amazon is teaming up  with to bring the future to life.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo plummeting over the outrage surrounding the phony  bank accounts costing the company its standing as the largest U.S. bank by  market capitalization.  JP Morgan back up to number one. </p><p>Many hold the bank's sales targets responsible for employee creating  unauthorized accounts.  But Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is shifting the  blame to employees.  He said quote, \"There was no incentive to do bad  things.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former FBI white collar crime expert Ken Springer  and IDT 911 founder Adam Levin.  Good to see you gentlemen.  Thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you.  What do you think was behind this  because now people are saying if this was so prevalent as Wells Fargo --  5,300 employees creating this phony accounts, are we going to see this at  other banks?</p><p>KEN SPRINGER, FORMER FBI WHITE COLLAR CRIME EXPERT:  Well, I don't know if  it's a fraud or a conspiracy because you can't have 5,300 people involved  in that.  I think more than anything it's probably aggressive sales  practices.</p><p>And I think if the FBI gets involved they can probably talk to some of  these people and they're going to find out what really happened.  Was it  limited to one region?  How far up the ladder does it go? </p><p>And I think the bigger issue is going to be if they did this would they  have opened other accounts for bad actors -- whether it's drug dealers,  money launderers and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we don't know that.  I mean we don't know who the accounts  were for -- right.</p><p>SPRINGER:  That hasn't come out.</p><p>BART:  Ok.  So the sales targets, Ken, were set by higher level executives.   One executive actually is leaving the bank with $126 million payday.  Since  then Wells Fargo has to pay hundred $185 million in fines for defrauding  customers.  This reported payday that Carrie Tolstedt is walking out with,  does this add to the wrongdoing in your view?  How does that play into  this?  This doesn't look good.</p><p>SPRINGER:  We don't know.  It doesn't look good.  And it goes back to I  think when Mary Jo White took over the SEC.  She talked about not letting  financial institutions say without admitting or denying guilt, paying the  fine and moving on.  I think they're going to see if there's someone who  should be held accountable for this violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Adam, you've got a book \"Swiped: How to protect  yourself in a world full of scammer, phishers and identity thieves\".  Will  you explain to us how we can protect our money at banks with what we see  happening.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN, IDT 911 FOUNDER:  Well, you know, again, here is a situation  where the bank ran off with the stork, consumers ended up holding the bag  that this system encouraged this kind of action.  And the things I talk  about in the book is you have to realize this is a classic definition of  identity theft that occurred.  People were using the personally  identifiable, sensitive information of other people for their gain.</p><p>So what consumers need to do is they need to do a number of things.  First,  you need to monitor.  You should be checking your accounts on a daily  basis.  You should be signing up for what is called transactional  monitoring alerts which means that any time there's any activity in your  accounts, you're notified of it and you should be specifically looking for  small charges or what they like to call ghost charges because usually they  are designed in order to evade bank systems and to evade consumer scrutiny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVIN:  You should also consider freezing your credit so that nobody  including you can get access to your credit for the purpose of opening up a  credit card account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's death by a thousand cuts -- Mike.</p><p>BAKER:  What you think is the proper response at this stage?  What should  they do -- senior management within Well Fargo?  </p><p>LEVIN:  I think that people have to walk the plank.  And I'm not just  talking about lower level people.  I think higher-level people -- the  confidence of consumers has been shaken in this financial institution.  And  as a result it will be shaken in other financial institutions and don't  forget, the scandal that happened a few years ago where a number of  financial institutions were reordering the chronology of debit accounts --  debit charges in order to put the consumer over on the first charge to  charge multiple over limit fees which is one of the things that led to the  Credit Card Reform Act.</p><p>MARTIN:  And that's the scary thing.  I mean this was going on for years  and years and years under Ms. Tolstedt's watch or on her watch and she was  able to stay in the position.  People were getting fired in her department  yet the banking executive did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't look good.</p><p>MARTIN:  If your consumer and you're banking at Wells Fargo, wow do you  feel good about having an account there.  The CEO has said he is not  resigning.  He's not leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>LEVIN:  But should there be the question, should there be a call back of  the $125 million that she's getting as she walks out the door.  I don't  think you reward people for being oblivious to things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Especially since she's walking out with all that money.</p><p>Ken -- real quick.  Final word from you in terms of what we should be  looking at for potential bank fraud.  You are former white-collar criminal  FBI so tell us what we should be looking at.</p><p>SPRINGER:  Well, there is a lot that needs to come out yet and probably in  the next 24, we'll learn a lot more.  But did they really -- we go in and  open an account at our bank.  Do you go in -- do you sign a signature card?   Do you show forms of ID?  I don't think that happened.  I think they  manipulated the system.  But there is still the potential for fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of this culture that you had to meet the sales targets.</p><p>SPRINGER:  I think that's what's going to happen.  I think the bigger fall  fallout is going to be 5,300 people are without a job now.  And they're  going to be kind of potentially toxic trying to get jobs now as part of  this.  And what can they do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  You're going to have that on your  resume.  Yes, I just came from Wells Fargo and this is why I left.</p><p>SPRINGER:  But in my experience -- I'm sorry, Maria -- is disclose it.   Tell it upfront because you know, it's like Drexel back years, MF Global,  people will get over it.  Tell them you were part of it and move on.</p><p>BAKER:  I think the key takeaway here is pay attention.  You've got a  personal responsibility.  You open an account.  You're dealing a financial  institution.  You've got a credit card or whatever it is, your statements  arrive, you've got to pay attention.  Otherwise things happen.  And as you  pointed out this is not the first time.</p><p>LEVIN:  No one has a greater interest in your financial security than you  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bottom line.</p><p>MARTIN:  These other people apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ken Springer, Adam Levin -- the book is \"Swiped\" -- thank you  so much, sir, for joining us.  Thank you very much Mr. Springer.</p><p>Coming up, another secretary of state and another scandal -- the shocking  claims surrounding John Kerry's tenure.</p><p>Plus making the Second Amendment fashionable?  The company giving new  meeting to conceal and carry.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody; welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday September 14.  Here are your top stories, 7:30  a.m. on the East Coast:  Breaking news moments ago, Bayer acquires  Monsanto, deal is done; valued at $66 billion, that is $128 per share.   This was first reported by our own Charlie Gasparino. (HEADLINES) (MARKET  HEADLINES)</p><p>President Obama on the campaign trail now for the ailing Hillary Clinton.   He used his time in Philadelphia yesterday to slam Donald Trump and his  comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  Think about what's happened to the Republican  Party.  They used to be opposed to Russian and authoritarianism.  Their  nominee is out their praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he  invades smaller countries, jails his opponents and when they interview him,  ask him, well, why do you support this guy?  Well, he's a strong guy.   Look, he's got an 82-percent poll rating.  Well, yes.  So did - Saddam  Hussein had a 90-percent poll rating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Donald Trump responded to President Obama's attack  on Twitter.  He said, \"Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years.   Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is former U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez.  He  is the author of the new book, \"True Faith and Allegiance.\"  Good morning,  Judge.  Good morning good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>ALBERTO GONZALEZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Good morning; it's good to  be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I've got to get your reaction to all of this talk about  Russia.  I mean, I seem to remember, quite clearly, it was President Obama  who whispered in the ear of then Prime Minister Medvedev to say, or he was  president at the time, I will have more flexibility, -- tell Vladimir Putin  I will have more flexibility after the election.  It seems there is a lot  more ties between Clinton and Obama and Secretary Clinton than Donald  Trump; correct me if I'm wrong.  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  I think you're right.  We have to remember that we're in this  sort of silly season right now.  We're in a political campaign and there  are going to be outrageous claims, honestly, made by both sides in order to  win political points.  But, obviously, we watch Russia very carefully.   Obviously what they do around the world is something of great interest to  us.  Because they are a powerful nation, they can be helpful in dealing  with certain problems that we need help with, for example in Syria.  So the  notion of having some kind of relationship with them is not a totally bad  thing.  </p><p>But, again, some of the comments yesterday from President Obama, I just  chalk up we're in the political season.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see; so have U.S.-Russian relations changed in the post-9/11  world, where the war on terror has been the top priority?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know, I think (inaudible) depending on circumstances.  I  don't know that I would trust Russia implicitly.  I think we need to --  they could be helpful, but obviously they will be doing some things that  are in their best interest and not necessarily consistent with our best  interest.  So we just simply have to deal with them, I think, with that  kind of mind set.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are obviously were in a very important place during the  beginning of the war on terror.  You are defending that in your new book,  \"True Faith and Allegiance,\" in your new memoir.  What are you trying to  communicate, Judge?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, one thing I try to communicate is all the difficult  decisions that President Bush had to make, and those of us who advised him;  some of them are controversial, but one of the things I hope that readers  come away with is how hard we worked to try to get it right, particularly  in terms of the legal issues that arose.  Many of these legal issues we had  not seen since World War II.  Some of the legal issues we had never seen  before, such as how do you deal effectively and legally with a non-state  actor.  </p><p>So hopefully - you know, I don't shy away from any of the controversial  issues.  They are all in the book, beginning with Guantanamo, military  commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, electronic surveillance,  it's all in there and hopefully the readers will have a better  understanding of the reasons why these decisions were made and the  rationale behind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So once we understand what took place and where we are right  now, the next question is where are we going.  We know that Donald Trump  has talked about expanding the military, investing in the military and  getting tougher.  Hillary Clinton has said she wants to continue many of  the policies of President Obama and that we need Middle Eastern friends  help to actually take down ISIS.  What is the right path going forward?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, I do believe we need Middle Eastern friends.  This is not  something that we can be successful alone.  However, I do worry about the  changing viewpoint about America around the world.  I think we are America.    We are the beacon of hope and democracy and we are expected to lead. I  worry that we sort of stepped back from that.  I think the common phrase is  we are leading from behind.  I just think that puts the United States in a  very dangerous and precarious position. </p><p>I worry that we are less today than we were, say, on 9/11, 15 years ago.   The threats have evolved and I think the United States needs to be very  forceful, in terms of trying to influence outcomes overseas.  I'm not  suggesting we put troops on the ground, but I think we need to influence  outcomes so we don't have outcomes that are contrary to our interests.  So,  I do worry about where we are today in foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you made a decision to support a Donald Trump for  president?  </p><p>GONZALEZ:  You know I'm a lifelong Republican.  I hope to vote republican,  but I'm an American first.  I'm going to vote in terms of who I believe is  best for America, best for me and for my family.  Listen, we still have two  months before the election.  We have three presidential debates coming up.   We've got time to make this decision, which is a very important one because  it is a very dangerous time around the world for us.  Also we have some  serious domestic policy issues that we need to confront, like the deficit.   So, I'm going to make a very informed decision.  I encourage all of your  viewers to do the same.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right; so you want to watch these debates and you want to  make sure you're solid before coming out publicly and endorsing the  Republican candidate. </p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on on the Democratic side, Judge, because  two witnesses, yesterday, at a House hearing on Hillary Clinton's email  server pled The Fifth, yesterday, while a third failed to show.  As a  former attorney general, should a special prosecutor have been important to  investigate Hillary's email server?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  That's a difficult one for me to answer.  I do know that the  unfortunate conversation that occurred between Loretta Lynch and former  President Bill Clinton at the airport.  I think that was very unfortunate  for the investigation, and, you know, some AG's may have taken that alone  as a basis to appoint a special prosecutor because, in the end, it's not  about the attorney general's involvement in the case that's important.   What is important is that we have total confidence in the justice system,  that it's going to be impartial in the way it conducts its investigation  and in the decision it makes to move forward with the prosecution.  </p><p>What I worry about what happened here is it appears as a result of that  conversation Attorney General Lynch sort of stepped away entirely from this  case and as a result it fell entirely to Jim Comey.  Most of your viewers  probably do not understand, the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The  FBI Director reports to the Attorney General, and at the end of the day the  FBI is response for investigations.  They present whatever they find to the  prosecutors and the prosecutors decide whether or not the case should move  forward or not.  It seems to me in this case it was sort of turned on its  head and the investigator, Jim Comey, made the decision not to move forward  with the prosecution; and that troubles me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, this is your, obviously, successor, Loretta Lynch.   If you were sitting on your plane, as attorney general, and you got the  message from your aide saying Bill Clinton wants to come up to the plane  and talk to you, and you know that Hillary Clinton is going to be  testifying or - not testifying but doing the interview with the FBI two  days later, what would you have said to your aide?  What should she have  done?  Should she have said, listen, I can't take the meeting?  What would  you have done?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Yes; I think that would've - look, at most you would go and say  hello to the president as a matter of courtesy and say, you know, hello.   Obviously because of the circumstances involving your wife we can't have a  conversation; or it would have been totally appropriate to simply say -  send back a message saying because of the circumstances involving your wife  it wouldn't look good for either the wife or the attorney general to have  any kind of conversation or meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; or how about having an aide on the plane?  Have you ever  seen a situation where such an important position doesn't have someone  taking notes?  There was no one else on the plane.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yes, that would not be unusual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Typically - a private meeting like that would likely occur,  where you would not have anybody on the plane. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess what I'm getting at, Judge, real quick, actually, have  we become incredibly politicized?  I mean, you see what happened with  Loretta Lynch on the plane with Bill Clinton.  Then you look at Jim Comey  testifying with the FBI investigation.  You look at the IRS targeting  conservatives.  What is going on?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Well, certainly there's the appearance of politicalization at  the Department of Justice, and that is troubling to me and that's something  that we should worry about and something the attorney general has an  obligation to address because the Department should be viewed as a  Department that operates without any kind of bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right; Mr. Gonzalez, good to have you on the program.  Judge,  thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Congratulations on the book.  Be  sure to turn in tomorrow, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee, and Indiana  Governor, Mike Pence my special guest.  Back in a moment; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Victims of the 2012 shooting at a Colorado movie  theatre will not be on the hook for the major legal fee.  Cheryl Casone  with that story and other headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl; thank you so much.  Coming up next, conceal  and carry getting more stylish.  How one company is helping women carry  their firearm fashionably; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Firearms and fashion, a combination that  gunmakers have ignored this for decades as they focus their marketing on  male customers.  Background checks for gun purchases hit a record high in  July and growing demand from women have created a new fashion industry.   This is amazing.  These products are designed for women, by women and they  offer a stylish look and practical way for women to carry their guns.  </p><p>Joining us right now is the owner of Nickel and Lace, Marilyn Smolenski.   Marilyn, good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARILYN SMOLENSKI, OWNER, NICKEL AND LACE:  Thank you for having me.  It's  a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you come up with this idea?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well, I was taking some classes with my husband back in 2011  and I just wasn't satisfied with any of the holsters that were on the  market.  They were all really geared towards men and men's bodies, not  women's figures, so I made my own.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We actually have one of my colleagues wearing it this morning,  I'm going to show it in a minute; but how did you get into the firearms  accessory business to begin with?  Did you see this demand out there that  you felt women needed fashion and an opportunity to conceal and carry?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes, ma'am; absolutely.  At the time most of the manufactures  were just making products smaller and turning them pink and that's how they  were marketed to women.  So there wasn't really anything for a woman's body  and for our curves and I definitely saw something, a need there on the  market for new items from women.  So I spoke to some girlfriends that were  in the fashion industry and also police officers and they were really  excited and really encouraged me to go forward with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of reception are you seeing right now at Nickel and  Lace?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Oh, just an outpouring of support.  You know, when I first  started it was kind of a taboo issue here in Chicago, as you can imagine --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  -- this is where I'm based.  But, you know, as time goes on or  more people are being supportive of it, especially as the crime goes up in  the city.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us what we need to know to actually wear one of these  things.  What are the particulars and how does it work?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  So the particulars are that this is a shapewear based  foundation, so it goes underneath your clothing, and it has special use  pockets on either side, so it's ambidextrous.  It's meant for a cross body  draw for a subcompact firearm.  So, for a smaller firearm, which does hide  better on a woman's body.  If you're not going to use of firearm, in places  like Chicago you can't carry everywhere, you can also carry your cellphone,  your keys, your id. It's also what I did when I was in Europe.  I was  carrying different items so I wouldn't get, let's say, pickpocketed on the  subway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a different -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  There is a lot of different functionalities to it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has different uses.  Morgan Ortagus, who is with us this  morning, has it on.  Let's take a look.  Morgan, how does it feel?  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  I love the fact that it's  shapewear.  We were just saying backstage you could wear this underneath a  blazer and then you could see the sides, right there, where the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gun would go.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- gun, your cellphone, whatever, right here.  So, yes, it feels  great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say it feels like it's a shaper.  You like it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It does feel like shapewear.  I might keep it on for the rest of  the show.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Well you can keep it.  You can have it if you love it.  It's  yours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the next for Nickel and Lace?  Are you planning to  expand this brand -</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- or are you going to stay with firearms?</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  You know what, we are going to expand to a lot of things but  most things are going to incorporate firearms.  We're working on outerwear  vest at the moment, and it will have conceal carry pockets on the inside of  a fashion vest, either faux fur or suede.  We're also working on a running  belly band for runners, as well as another shape wear but with some lace  and added features to it.  So we are just plowing away with research and  development and making our products better and more useful for women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, no doubt, being based in Chicago you've seen what has  gone on there, in terms of the murders in the violence.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it must be resonating in Chicago?  People want to protect  themselves.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  It really is.  Correct.  Correct.  You know, my sales were more  out of state before, but now, with the rise in crime, I am seeing an  increase in sales, as well, here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn, we'll be watching the developments.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>SMOLENSKI:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marilyn Smolenski there joining us; Nickel and Lace.  And,  Morgan, you may wear this for the rest of the show?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Listen, you know, shape wear and pistols?  God Bless America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go; coming up, the fast food wars are heating up.  We  tried the Burger King Cheetos Chicken fries but that's not all the  industries doing to being in customers.  We'll talk to the former Young  Brown's founder, David Novak in the next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; good Wednesday morning, everybody.

Good to see, everybody.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, CO-CHAIR, MAVERICK PAC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  A lot to talk about this  morning.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:   Definitely; I mean, the markets have really been front and center this  week, haven't they?  A lot of volatility.  So we went through this period,  Maria, a couple of months, I mean, back, really, post Brexit and then all  of a sudden the markets got crazy volatile after kind of being in a summer  slumber for a little while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is true.  And we've got mergers to talk about, as well  as these valuations plus so much on the political front.   Joining us this  morning, coming up, FOX News Military Analyst, Retired Four Star General  Jack Kean is with me; Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, Congressman John Mica; and, former U.S. Attorney General Alberto  Gonzalez joins us.  You don't want to miss a moment of it, so do stay with  us.  </p><p>We kick it off right now with our top story: Republican Presidential  Nominee Donald Trump lays out his plan for affordable child care with his  daughter at his side, Ivanka Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Child care is such a big problem.   We're going to solve that problem.  That means we need working mothers to  be fairly compensated for their work and have access to affordable, quality  child care for their kids.  That's what we're doing.  We want higher pay,  better wages and a growing economy for everybody.</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF DONALD TRUMP:  Raising children full-time is one  of the hardest jobs anyone can do and it's essential that our policies  recognize and honor that reality. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who was at  the event yesterday.  Congresswoman, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was watching you last night, taking such leadership, getting  up there on stage, taking the microphone.  I want to ask you about this  plan, whether it is a game changer, but then I also want to ask you about  the woman vote.  Areas in Pennsylvania, he needs to win Pennsylvania and he  needs that woman vote.  Talk about the plan for a second.  Is this a game  changer, when it comes to winning over more female voters go to childcare?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, Maria, it is indeed because not only is it a game changer,  but what you're doing is starting a conversation.  So this is the  conversation starter.  You're talking about options.  You're talking about  relief; how to deal with childcare and make certain that children are safe  and have access to the opportunities you want them to have and experience  is one of the top issues for working parents.  </p><p>And I think it is so important that the deductibility for those child care  expenses, being able to do that birth through 13. Stay-at-home moms also  having the opportunity to access that tax incentive that is something that  is very important.  Then when you look at the Dependent Care Savings  Account that you can use for elder care.  How many of us end up caring for  elderly relatives?  So this is a way to help offset some of that expense.  </p><p>The other thing I liked was the fact that we've always had this debate  about paid maternity leave and here is an option that is a good  conversation starter saying, go after waste, fraud and abuse and  unemployment insurance program and put it through that.  So plenty for  Capitol Hill to work on, to talk about and I think good conversation  starter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that because on the one hand there  are a lot of good things in here for mothers, for women, for families.  On  the other hand, this, sort of, goes against what the Republicans have been  talking about for a long time, and that is too much spending.  Donald Trump  came out, right off the bat in this campaign saying, we are going to  eliminate all these deductions and here we see the child care deduction.   How does that sit with you, in terms of the spending portion of this, and  how you pay for this?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, I think the big difference there is previously when you  would hear things about child care or paid maternity leave it was always a  mandate and, okay, we are going to mandate this and then the private sector  figure out how to handle it.  Now, what he is saying is, look, let's look  at the tax code and families have changed.  Work conditions have changed.   The way people have organized their family life has changed.  So, yes, it  is a family issue and let's look at the tax code.  Let's look at  incentives.  It's another option.  If you want to take advantage of it, it  is there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  So since we have this tax code, let's put this into it and use  that as a starting point and see where we get.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to bring in one of my colleagues here because I want to  talk about the woman vote, but before we get to you, Morgan, yesterday,  Marsha, three workers were called to testify before Congressional Oversight  Committee on Hillary Clinton's use of private server.  You've worked a lot  on this subject.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, I have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They all pled The Fifth.  Listen to this, Congresswoman.  I  want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to  answer and I assert my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I respectfully decline to answer and assert my Fifth  Amendment Constitutional privilege.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no opening statement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just found this stunning.  There's also this email,  Congresswoman that show workers in Platte River Networks, this was the  company that managed her server, they were concerned about a cover-up.  One  email says, \"Starting to think this whole thing really is about covering up  some shady stuff, I will say.\"  What's your reaction to this Congresswoman?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think somebody was pretty perceptive when they wrote that  email and the American people are finding that out now.  This is another of  the pattern of deception that you get from Bill and Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>The Clinton Foundation needs an investigation.  They did not file those  990's on foreign funds for a period of 10 years, and only did it after they  felt like they had to; and now they never filed the proper paperwork.  You  look at Lorient, you look at Frank (Inaudible); you look at Uranium One;  you look at what happened with Russia.  I just -- the Nicaraguan land deal;  I mean, Maria, this goes on and on and on. </p><p>One of the things I've heard about from people, also, is the string of  emails that show people that donated to the Clinton Foundation would then  go back through and ask preferential treatment, via the State Department,  with passports, with visas, things that people have to deal with if they  want to travel.  So they thought since they were giving Clinton Foundation  money, they were entitled to a preferential treatment.  That really - you  know, people don't like that and they are very curious about really  happened there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is getting extraordinary by the moment.  It's actually  incredible.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Stickier every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Every day.  So you've got this happening on the Clinton side  and then Donald Trump trying to appeal to women.  Morgan Ortagus, do you  think this situation is resonating with women and do you think this child  care proposal is going to lure in that vote? </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I do.  I think that I'm the age demographic that Donald Trump  should be going after.  I'm 33 years old, married, woman working in New  York.  When they put Ivanka on stage, every time I'm impressed with her.  I  think a lot of young women are.  So if Kellyanne Conway can convince Ivanka  to go onstage between now, every day until Election Day, I think it will be  a smart thing for the campaign because these are the issues that women my  age are facing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  How do we have a career?  How do we raise children?  But what's  really important, and I think the Congresswoman made a great point, it  wasn't just that we are mandating to business, Trump offered a plan to pay  for that, and that's important, I think.  Whatever we do for business going  forward, there has to be a plan to pay for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, what about this New York Attorney General now,  opening an inquiry into the Trump Foundation just as President Obama, by  the way, yesterday took to the campaign trail?  He slammed Donald Trump.   He's stumping for Hillary Clinton.  Listen to this, Congresswoman.  We have  to get your reaction here too.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  You want to debate foundations and charities?  One  candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world.   The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his  charity and then bought a 6-foot tall painting of himself.  I mean - you  know -- he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but - </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in response, Donald Trump tweeted out, \"Why isn't President  Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?\"  Congresswoman  Blackburn, what impact do you think this inquiry from Schneidermann's  office will have on Trump's campaign?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  You know, it's very interesting, Maria.  I think it's going to  raise more questions about the Clinton Foundation.  And the President's  inappropriate remarks yesterday listening to him, my goodness, why don't  you look at what happened with HIV drugs in Africa and the link there with  some of the India pharmaceutical companies and some of the drugs that  really probably -- there are just a lot of questions on that issue, of what  happened with those HIV drugs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- and the association there.  So I know that there is more  information on that and it is a debate that is going to move forward and I  think Hillary Clinton is really in trouble.  </p><p>I was on the ground in New Hampshire on Saturday; it's a 1-point race  there.  And this all adds to the discussion of my, goodness, you cannot  trust Bill and Hillary Clinton.  She is a liar.  She is untrustworthy.  The  actions of their Foundation show that and I think that what I've heard and  read on Twitter, social media, people are saying why aren't they  investigating the Clinton Foundation?  You've got people sitting in those  witness chairs in D.C. that are saying well, I didn't have a security  clearance and I worked on the server and they see this as being unfair and  they see a lot of inequity of the system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, when I was watching a video last night, of all of them  saying, ten times, under the advice of counsel I'm not going to answer any  questions -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I thought to myself, well, we know these guys destroyed  emails.  We know -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Connect the dots for me?  How does that happen?  We know  already that they destroyed emails and yet they're allowed to just take the  Fifth and we are done.  I mean, is it done?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, -- but here is the thing, we are not done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They know they are guilty so that is why, yes, they took the  Fifth.  People want to know more about what has happened with the Clinton  Foundation.  How did they go for ten years and not file 990's and take that  foreign money?  Bill Clinton now saying, you know, when Hillary becomes  president we are going to stop taking foreign donations.  That's like, you  better line up now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Make contributions now.  That's kind of the altar call, if you  will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  So, I think people see through this.  They know what they get  with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and I don't think the American people want  another four years of that, quite frankly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, good to see you.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you, Maria; thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn there.  Coming up next taking a  look at this dramatic moment caught on a surveillance camera, a man plowing  into three police officers with his car at a Phoenix gas station; details  on the disturbing incident next.  Then, skyrocketing EpiPen prices, even  higher paydays at Mylan.  Next, we will tell you how much more Mylan  executives were paid than their peers at much larger pharmaceutical  companies; back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, an Arizona man reportedly drives his car into  three police officers at a gas station on purpose.  Cheryl Casone with the  details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, on purpose; that's the key phrase  in this story, Maria.  (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, really interesting numbers there, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.   Coming up next, the State Department now admitting that the Iran Nuclear  Deal may be to blame for the worsening tensions with the country; more on  the consequences coming next.  Then, Bayer set to acquire Monsanto, $65  billion deal.  We are looking for the confirmation any minute now.  Take a  look at who benefits from this tie-up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An imminent deal on the horizon; Bayer closing  in on a $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  That was first reported by  FOX Business Network's Charlie Gasparino.  The merger expected to be made  official this morning.  After months of wrangling, the deal would be the  largest of 2016, in terms of M&amp;A.</p><p>Joining us right now on the phone is FOX Business Senior Correspondent  Charlie Gasparino.  Charlie thanks for calling in.  Break down what we know  so far. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FBN CORRESPONDENT, via telephone:  $128 a share; a lot  of people thought it would be about $130.  It's not.  It's right below  that.  It's an all-cash deal, which was very enticing to Monsanto board  members, and I think this is like what got it over the hump.  As you know,  they've been wrangling about this since March.  We actually broke when it  first became public that Bayer was interested and that they had made an  official bid back in May, so this tells how long it's been going on.  </p><p>But this was the clincher, I believe, a $2 billion breakup fee.  So that  means if regulators, and I will tell you, there's a lot of regulatory talk  about this.  This will get intense regulatory scrutiny.  If regulators nix  this thing, Monsanto gets a $2 billion check.  I think that's what put it  over the top.</p><p>Now, if you look at the share price this morning, even - you know, the deal  hasn't been announced but I mean, I guess we are pretty much -- we know  what's going on.  It's six hours difference between here and Germany.  So  you can expect this thing to be announced, officially, very soon. </p><p>If you notice, the price is not - is nowhere near $128.  I think that  reflects two things: (1) the deal hasn't been announced, and, you know,  it's never a deal until you see the press release; but I think the even  bigger concern is the regulatory scrutiny.  You've got E.U. regulators,  U.S. Justice Department Antitrust are going to be all over this.  This  deal, as you said, is the biggest deal of the year but, you know, to just  think about all of the various chemical and agricultural products that both  companies bring to the table.  I mean, this is going to be a huge  undertaking, taking these two companies and putting them together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  So that's why the deal is not trading, that plus it's never a  done deal until you see it in writing but I think the regulatory concerns  have investors a little freaked out right now.</p><p>MARTIN:  Charlie, on that note, what do you make of the regulatory  environment that's out there now.  I mean, you mentioned the Department of  Justice and some of the other regulators got in the way of the Office Depo  and Staples issue, or at least the merger there.  I mean, what do you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pfizer-Allergan.  </p><p>MARTIN:  You can go on.  I mean, Charlie, what do you think about some of  these deals going forward, not just this one but other ones that may come  out here, where companies may talk to each other but not go through with  things?  What do you make of how things are, regulatorily, with regard to  some of these deals that are out there?</p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, I mean, if you notice the E.U. has been pushing back on  some of these cross-border agriculture deals.  I mean, there's a few of  them that are out there right now.  DuPont, I believe, has one that's being  held up and, you know, this is a big concern.  Listen, there are two  complicating matters here: (1) it's two huge companies.  I mean, Monsanto  is one of the biggest U.S. companies out there.  Bayer is this huge  conglomerate in Germany.  So you have two sets of regulators, not just one.   You have U.S. Antitrust.  You have E.U. regulators.  </p><p>You know, that's what the markets say, and I can tell you that when this  thing is done and you start talking to investment bankers, you know, they  think that they got this covered.  They are going to share some noncore  assets, meaning Bayer will, and they think they are going to be able to  appease the -- appease the people.  But I will just tell you this, that's  what the New York Stock Exchange and the Deutsche (Inaudible) thought a  couple of years ago when they were looking to merge and, as you know, it  didn't happen.  </p><p>So, you know, one thing as being a journalist, I get paid no matter what  happens with this deal.  My job is just to break the deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Charlie.  We'll wait for the announcement.  You know  what's interesting, I think, the E.U. looks at deal-making differently than  the U.S. does.  The E.U. is trying to protect competitors.  So if this deal  is too big to take market share from competitors, it actually -</p><p>MARTIN:  Exactly, and that's the whole issue and I think that's what's  dangerous about this deal and some of the other ones that have been rumored  to be in the works, it's how the E.U. comes into play here, given that  they're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see about that.  We're going to take a short break.   Still to come, President Obama wants to admit 25,000 more refugees into the  country now, more than the 85,000 who have already arrived this year.  The  national security concerns front and center when we come right back.  Mike  Baker is going to weigh in on that.  Then, America's top athletes are the  targets of a Russian hack attack; hackers releasing the medical records of  Simone Biles and the Williams Sisters.  The details next; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, September 14th.  Here are your top stories at  6:30 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p>The role of technology in the race for the White House.  New questions this  morning over how Google could be affecting the vote.</p><p>Tensions rising with Iran and the State Department admitting that the  nuclear deal may be the reason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have seen disturbing trends makes significance of  the nuclear agreement much more important because the last thing anyone  would want to see a nuclear armed Iran, but it also shows that Iran has a  choice to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ramping up the refugee levels meanwhile, Secretary of State,  John Kerry, reveals how many more people the Obama administration says it  wants to bring into this country now.  The details coming up.</p><p>A failing grade for Detroit schools, students are suing the governor, the  latest coming up.</p><p>And America's top athletes have become the latest target of a cyber threat.   Medical records of Simone Biles and the Williams sisters released by  Russian hackers.</p><p>Credit cards, we use them every day, but a new study says most Americans  probably do not understand their contracts because there are too hard to  read.  What you need to know to protect yourself.</p><p>Markets this morning looking higher.  Futures indicating a fractionally  better opening this morning for the broader averages.  The Nasdaq up a  quarter of a percent right now.</p><p>In Europe stocks are edging higher as well as.  We got a rebound in the  price of oil this morning and that is boosting stocks in Europe.  The FT  100 up, three quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>Different story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, take a look,  the markets in Korea, by the way, are closed today for a holiday.</p><p>Well, the Obama administration admitting now that the Iran nuclear deal may  be to blame for Iran's increased aggressions, this coming just three days  after Iran's military threatened to shoot down a pair of U.S. Navy planes  operating in international air space.</p><p>State Department spokesperson, Mark Toner, said this yesterday.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TONER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  As much as we would like to see  Iran's behavior change in the region, we've not seen a significant shift.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But you can't rule out that, in fact, this deal has  served as a cause for this more aggressive posture?</p><p>TONER:  I mean, I can't rule that out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This marking the first time any senior U.S. official has  acknowledged Iran's behavior is actually worsening.</p><p>Joining me right is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.  General  Keane, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Good to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last time we were together, we spoke about Iran testing the  limits, testing Islam.  It's provoking the United States in the wake of  this Iran deal.</p><p>Now we hear from the administration, are they finally realizing this deal  was a mistake or what do you think is going on now given what we have seen  from Iran against our military in the last several months?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, they'll never admit that the nuclear deal was a mistake  because it was seminal objective of the Obama administration's foreign  policy.  So that's going to stay on the table.</p><p>They're going to claim that this is a good deal.  They were incredibly  naive because they also believed that the deal somehow in terms of a  strategic objective would motivate and inspire the Iranians to join the  international community of nations and behave reasonably like other nations  in the region do.</p><p>That was always nonsense.  No one believed that that would happen.  The  Iranians have been since 1980, Maria.  The strategic objective is not a  nuclear weapon.  The strategic objectives is domination of the Middle East  and they have never come off of that.</p><p>To do that, drive the United States out, weaken the relationship between  the United States and the Sunni Arabs and that's what bullying the United  States is about and trying to humiliate us is to weaken our relationship  here with the Sunni Arabs.</p><p>Are they emboldened by the nuclear deal?  You bet you they are, they got  what they wanted.  You know, the deal, Maria, legitimizes them within their  own country among their own people.</p><p>It's doubtful we will ever see July 2009 repeated again with that movements  in the streets of Tehran trying to overthrow that regime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So OK, we've got obviously a few more months of President  Obama's presidency where he's not going to do anything.  What do you want  to see in the next administration regardless of who it is, General, in  terms of the Iran relationship?  What should be done?  Are we supposed to  just take this taunting and bullying from the Iranians on our military men  and women?</p><p>KEANE:  I think things will change almost dramatically regardless of who is  president because I believe for a long time and I think you see it in the  behavior of the Iranians, Russians, Chinese that we have a weak president  and this empty rhetoric and they can take advantage of this president.</p><p>Clearly what must happen is the United States has to reengage in the Middle  East.  We have to get back involved with our Sunni Arabs.  We have to have  a strategic alliance and recognize that Iran is the number one adversary  from a nation's states perspective in the Middle East.</p><p>And they are threatening the stability and security of the Middle East and  therefore threatening the economic and prosperity and well-being of the  global marketplace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's really extraordinary, actually.  The Obama  administration, now this, General, it's announcing new plans to raise the  number of refugees admitted to the United States in 2017 by 30 percent.</p><p>So we are talking about 110,000 refugees in 2017.  The administration  already called for 85,000 and they're already here.  Some of these refugees  will be coming through Syria, does an increase in migrants correlate to an  increase in terror threats?</p><p>KEANE:  Not necessarily but it certainly is an increase in the level of  security that we have to have.  We -- so our viewers understand, we  traditionally take in 70,000 to 80,000 refugees.  Now refugees are not part  of the normal immigration process.</p><p>These are people who are seeking asylum largely because of political  oppression and when it comes to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, some are  literally coming because of survivability particularly out of Syria.</p><p>What I think we should do if we are going to increase the numbers coming  out of Syria, bring in the Homeland Security immigration folks, we just  brought in ten thousand of them.</p><p>I think it has gone largely better than most expected, but I would still  like to see those officials come before the Congress and explain this  program and how they have strengthened it.  And make certain that if we are  going to increase those numbers out of Syria that we are not going to have  any concerns.</p><p>What they have taken in as I've been told by people involved in the process  is largely families, some who have been tortured, some who have been  displaced and some have illnesses, et cetera, if that is going to continue,  we should be OK.</p><p>But I think that Congress deserves as representatives of the American  people to see the details of that so we are clear that we are going to be  able to protect the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, do you have confidence in the vetting process?  You  know, over the last six, eight months we have been talking about the fact  that ISIS has been very clear, they have a passport-making machine, they're  going infiltrate the refugee flow, they have done it in Europe.  What's  your confidence level when it comes to the vetting process in the U.S.  right now?</p><p>KEANE:  That's a great question.  Well, first of all, there is a problem in  Europe and because there is no process there.  Second, ISIS has said that  they will infiltrate.  I do believe, Maria, take some credit here.</p><p>I think the attention that the media has placed on this issue particularly  Fox in reporting this and getting the Congress heavily engaged in this has  forced the administration to get into the details of this maybe a little  bit more than what they would have for these Syrian refugees.</p><p>And I think they're sort of all in on this thing to be frank about it.  So  I don't have the concerns now that I had months ago because I believe  anecdotally the feedback is this has gone pretty well.</p><p>Look at, this refugee program in general which have been going on for  years, we have never had a single one of them that I'm aware of them ever  commit a terrorist act.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a great point and obviously the media,  certainly, Fox has been reacting to viewers, OK, I mean, that's why we are  focused on it because we are hearing from viewers.</p><p>In the face of all of this, General, we have North Korea.  So I want to get  your take on the weapons there.  Experts are saying that the country will  have enough nuclear material for 20 bombs by the end of this year, 20  bombs.</p><p>North Korea just conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test, as you know  that was last week, what responsibility does the U.S. have in relation to  North Korea's nuclear program?  What should be the response?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  This is a Soviet challenge.  We credited North Korea  somewhere around six to seven bombs.  Now they are going to be up to 20  because of their enhanced enrichment capabilities that they have.</p><p>They've got a couple of facilities to do that and we have classified ways  to sort of monitor that activity.  That's how we can come up this with  number, so to speak.</p><p>Nuclear weapons, what is North Korea up to with these nuclear weapons?   Clearly they want to build a missile capable of having a nuclear weapon on  that they can reach the United States.  Are they really going to attack the  United States?  I doubt that.</p><p>So what is going on?  Nuclear weapons have always been about regime  preservation, this regime, third generation, that's all they care about.   They suck this country dry just to take care of themselves.</p><p>It's a brutal repressive regime and that's all they care about.  They look  at Saddam Hussein, if he had nuclear weapon, he would never been deposed.</p><p>They looked at Gaddafi, if he had a nuclear weapon, she would have never  been deposed and that's why they want this nuclear.  Now they threatened  the use of these nuclear weapons offensively I believe mostly for  geopolitical and economic leverage.</p><p>And to make certain that South Korea is never ever going to think about  unifying that peninsula and making a one Korea out of that peninsula.  I  think largely what scares us or concerns us, this guy is a nut.</p><p>He's not a rational actor like the Soviet Union was, who had dangerous  nuclear weapons for years and was an adversary.  So that's why we've got so  much concern.  We don't have rational actors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's very interesting.  I did not realize it was  largely about staying in power.  General, thanks so much.  Such great  insight always from you.  We appreciate your time this morning, sir.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, parents of students in Detroit giving the city schools a poor  report card, they are suing Governor Rick Snider and education officials  for the failing states of the public schools in Detroit.</p><p>And then Oprah's portfolio taking a hit as shares of Weight Watchers have  plummeted.  Straight ahead, what is next for the talk show queen's role and  the company's quest for a new CEO?  We will check it out.  Stay with  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Stocks are looking higher this morning.  Take a  look at futures indicating a fractionally better opening for the broader  averages this morning.</p><p>A handful of names on the move this morning, Weight Watchers shares taking  a hit after CEO, James Chambers resigned.  The stock fell over 8 percent  following that news yesterday reportedly cost investor, Oprah Winfrey,  nearly $120 million just on that move.</p><p>We are also watching shares of Ford Motor, the company holding its Annual  Investor Day today where it will present its financial outlook for 2017.   It's also discussing future business and product strategy, could include  more insight on Ford's ride sharing business as well.  The stock finished  fractionally lower yesterday.</p><p>Russian hackers at it again.  Now confidential medical information from  U.S. female athletes who competed at the Rio Olympics has been posted  online.  Cheryl Casone with the story and headlines now.  Cheryl, good  morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  Well, the athletes  include gymnast, Simone Biles, tennis players, Serena and Venus Williams  and basketball player, Alena Deladon (ph).  The World Doping Agency said a  Russian cyber espionage group called \"Fancy Bears\" hacked its database and  revealed records of exemptions, which allowed athletes to use banned  substances because of a verified medical need.</p><p>Here is what Simone Biles tweeted.  She said that she is taking drugs to  treat ADHD since she was a kid.  Her tweet says, \"Please know I believe in  clean sport and have always followed the rules and will continue to do so.   This fair play is critical to sport and very important to me.\"  She has a  very good attitude about all of this, we should say.</p><p>Parents of Detroit school children are suing Michigan Governor Rick Snyder  saying their kids lack a fighting chance.  The lawsuit claims the state  deliberately has failed to provide necessary tools to provide a good  education.</p><p>Lawyer for the students say that it's the country's first federal case that  pushes for literacy as a right under the U.S. Constitution.  The suit seeks  a number of remedies including evidence-based literacy programs and a  system to monitor conditions that deny access to literacy.</p><p>And finally this, a new study finds credit card agreements are just too  hard for most Americans to read.  Creditcards.com says they're typically  written at the 11th grade reading level and half of Americans read at of  ninth grade level or below.</p><p>Creditcards.com analysed more than 2,000 credit card agreements about 45  percent of cardholders surveyed, Maria, said they never, hardly ever read  their credit card agreement.  And I bet if you ask most of them, they would  have no clue what their interest rate is on those cards.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  Well, it's all the fine print, Scott Martin?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, by all the debt, they've been  ranking up.  I think Cheryl is right.  They don't understand the APR  because clearly a credit card debt being on the rise here and a lot of  folks unfortunately over leveraging and making minimum payments, but still  carrying balances and therefore getting charged on interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get back to another story that Cheryl brought us and  that is this doping scandal and this hacking.  Mike Baker, I mean, it  happens all over and now we have another e-mail dump, what's your take on  this?  Should we be worried?</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER:  Well, we should be  worried, but you know, what we also have to realize is this is not  something new.  We are talking about it now, but this has been going on for  years.  We are a little bit slow on getting to the game.</p><p>I mean, Congress is still trying to sort out some legislation.  The  Pentagon still doesn't really have a protocol for what is a cyber warfare.</p><p>So in a sense the horse has left the barn, we lost a lot of information  through economic espionage, to state sponsored, and China is the number one  sponsor of this sort of activity in cyberspace.  Russia being number two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It keeps coming from Russia, though, it feels like.</p><p>BAKER:  Well, I does.  I mean, because Russia's got a lot of what they call  persistent threats.  They are not necessarily state sponsored, but they are  sudo state sponsored so there's a cut out there and there is claim of  disconnect between the government and these various hacking groups.</p><p>So this one that went after the doping federation is an example, \"Fancy  Bears,\" which has no connection to Carebears which is a great -- </p><p>MARTIN::  I guess that \"Fancy Bears\" is like a rogue part of like the  Carebears -- </p><p>BAKER:  That would make a great -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Is there any collaboration between Russia and China with all of  these hacks?  I mean, it's hard to track these guys sometimes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a fine question because actually at the end of the  day they all hate each other.  I mean, I don't -- </p><p>BAKER:  We sometimes forget that here.  Each country acts in its own best  interest.  General Keane is fantastic in talking about Iran, and he was  very clear about this.  Iran is emboldened by this nuke deal.</p><p>We looked at the nuke deal or the administration did as if somehow we were  going to be on the same agenda and what the current administration seems to  forget is that each nation acts in its own best interest.</p><p>So Russia acts in its own best interest.  There is no cooperation between  them and China.  Is there a cooperation between China and North Korea?   There is to some degree.  The North Koreans have been trained into high  level by Chinese agents.  And so there is a connection there to some degree  -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Similar interests and geographical area.</p><p>BAKER:  But what we're seeing from the Russians, this \"Fancy Bears\" group  that went after the doping federation is the same that went after the DNC.   But there are a number of these groups and to say that somehow they're  completely separate from the Russian government would be naive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, all right, we want to talk more about that this morning.  I  have to get your take on the increasing expectations of numbers of refugees  coming into the country.</p><p>Take a short break, more from our panel coming up and then Google helps you  complete your search request, right, but also may be influencing your vote,  how the search engine could be favoring one candidate.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Google's auto complete is bias in favor of Hillary Clinton.   That is what recent research from Sputnik News suggest.  Google reportedly  suggest only positive search results for the Democratic presidential  candidate.</p><p>Joining me right now the man behind the article, senior research  psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and  Technology, Dr. Robert Epstein.  Dr. Epstein, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>DR. ROBERT EPSTEIN, AIBRT SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST:  Well, thank you,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, most people when they use Google they are not  expecting it to get political.  So tell us what your findings suggest?</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, there are a little shocking, we did an experiment to see  what happens when you show people negative search suggestions like  something about Hillary's health or Donald Trump's flip-flops or things  like that.</p><p>And what we found is that negative search suggestions attract a tremendous  number of clicks especially for undecided voters, undecided voters will  click on a negative search suggestion about 15 times as often as they will  click on a neutral search suggestion.</p><p>So a simple way to kind of rig an election is suppress negative search  suggestions for your favorite candidate, but to allow negative search  suggestions for the other candidate.  And there's a lot of evidence that,  in fact, Google has been doing exactly that for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We know that the founders and senior leadership are fans  of Hillary, I mean, Eric Schmidt, and the founders of the company as well,  but they -- they have said, look, this is auto complete and this is not --  this is not something that we can control, so what's the answer to that?</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, we looked at that carefully and what we found is in fact  their suppressing all negatives for Hillary Clinton, but they're not doing  that for other people, prominent people including Donald Trump.</p><p>So there does seem to be bias there, not only that, the numbers are big  because we estimate that this manipulation alone will shift somewhere  between 800,000 and 3.2 million votes in November.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, Mike Baker, this is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>BAKER:  It is extraordinary.  When you talk in light of the previous story  about Russian hacking, and you talk about what's the game plan behind the  Russian hacking of the DNC in the electoral infrastructure, in part it's  possibly to damage the trust in the system.</p><p>You see something about this that the doctor is talking about Google and it  has in the sense same impact once it becomes public, once people are aware  of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who do you trust?</p><p>BAKER:  Right, exactly, who do you trust?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, Dr. Epstein, what should we be doing about this?   Obviously we want to make sure people understand that there's a capability  to do this.</p><p>EPSTEIN:  The problem is that our research also show that generally  speaking, people can't see this kind of manipulation.  You know, they are  just -- you know, they are acting very smoothly.  They are getting some  suggestions, they are clicking on something.</p><p>Basically people are unaware and especially in search rankings people are  entirely unaware of any kind of manipulations there.  And if you manipulate  search rankings to favor one candidate that can shift 2.6 million and 10.4  million votes with no one being aware and no paper trail.</p><p>MARTIN:  Because it comes to the top page.  You not only get the  autocorrect, but you get the story at the top.  How many times you Googled  something and you go to the top five and pick the story out of the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, we know that Google is denying this, Dr. Epstein,  but we also know when it comes to like Facebook, the founder just gave  money $20 million to Hillary.  So I mean, some are being clear about who  their candidate is.</p><p>EPSTEIN:  Well, there's no question that there's favoritism here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Epstein, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate  it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Equity prices have swooned then recovered many times, and whether the economy collapses depends mostly on Washington policymakers wrecking things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans emerged from World War II with worn-out cars and appliances, and the rush to replace them sent the economy surging. Once consumers were satiated, the collapse in demand that followed precipitated a slowdown, and such boom-bust cycles repeated for several decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Beginning in the 1980s, an economy more based on services and technology became less vulnerable to such cyclical swings. And nascent artificial intelligence and logistics software helped businesses better anticipate demand to avoid overproduction and layoffs.</p><p>Until the financial crisis - which was precipitated by the disastrous decisions to repeal Glass-Steagall and ignore reckless mortgage lending and securities trading by banks, insurance companies and other, shadowy financial institutions - growth and unemployment became much less variable. Economists call these decades the Great Moderation.</p><p>Now with the financial crisis behind us, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is optimistic the economy can continue expanding and unemployment in check, but both the Fed chairman and president are giving stock investors a bad case of nerves.</p><p>Trade with China and our allies needs fixing. Everything from global trade rules to international postal rates has been rigged to give America a whopping trade deficit. Despite being the most competitive economy on the planet, we are racking up foreign debt to finance our deficits like pre-crisis Greece.</p><p>The broad tariffs on Chinese imports may be essential to resetting our trading relationship, but the administration has them substantially wrong.</p><p>From bicycles to pleasure boats, the administration has levied tariffs on imported components but not on the final products. That is driving manufacturers to move production or source more outside the United States - and basic product design, software, logistics and a multitude of other supporting service activities will follow.</p><p>The Fed is correct to gradually move up interest rates, because permanently low interest rates overinflate land and other asset values. However, Fed policy statements indicate its target federal funds rate is about 3.4 percent by early 2020, and that's well above what economists estimate is the neutral rate of interest that neither slows nor overheats the economy.</p><p>The boom for big tech appears over as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google are nearing market saturation and all face tough regulatory challenges. But where technology takes away, it also gives.</p><p>Artificial intelligence and robotics are spreading through the economy. Businesses are investing heavily in these and worker training, and investors need to seek out the next round of stars. Some will be among old line, dull companies like Walmart, which is learning to use the web to compete effectively with Amazon. But mostly it's companies that are developing technologies like drones and driverless vehicles and those that build robots and write software that multiply the productivity of ordinary workers.</p><p>The rotation out of big tech and the difficulty of finding these new stars - especially, when startups are staying private longer - makes stocks more volatile and equity investing more difficult. In the fullness of time, markets work these things out.</p><p>For now, the two most critical events are the December meeting of the Fed policymaking committee, when it is set to raise federal funds rate to nearly 2.5 percent and give new guidance about how much further it intends to push that rate next year, and Mr. Trump's decision to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no new progress is achieved at the Dec. 1 conclusion of the G20 Summit. Watch closely for whether he broadens tariffs to include more final goods that are disadvantaged by duties on their imported components.</p><p>A crisis in the Middle East is always possible, but for now oil prices don't appear headed for $100 a barrel and whatever else can happen is beyond even the much storied forecasting abilities of economists.</p><p>Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5bfef3c6e51b9image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE- In this Jan. 30, 2018, file photo a rubber tire gantry moves into position to transfer shipping containers at the Georgia Ports Authority's Port of Savannah in Savannah, Ga.

The Nasdaq Composite Index has sailed from 5036.37 on July 19, 2016 to 7761.04.86 at the closing bell on Thursday - continuously meeting and exceeding record highs along the way.We have seen similar market trends in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S...00, which have climbed from 18559.01 and 2163.78 on the day Trump was nominated to 25175.31 and 2782.49 by Thursday, respectively.This market strength (especially the Nasdaq's) is a really big deal. We are in an age of massive technological advancement and innovation that could potentially catapult our society into a new era of global leadership. Advancements in driverless cars, artificial intelligence, computing power, and helpful uses for big data will bring about changes in virtually every aspect of our lives, including health care, transportation, communication, and commerce. </p><p>The Nasdaq tracks almost 3,000 mostly technology-focused companies which are working on these dramatic innovations. This includes America's five largest big tech companies - Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT).I had a great FacebookLive conversation last week with Terry Campbell, Nasdaq's vice president and head of government relations. We talked about the amazing comeback that the American economy has been seeing under <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and the Republican leadership.Newt Live at Nasdaq<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnewtgingrich%2Fvideos%2F10156322339027429%2F...w;_text=0...th;=560\">https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fnewtgingrich%2Fvideos%2F10156322339027429%2F...w;_text=0...th;=560</url>[2]As I wrote in my new book, Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback, our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been on the rise. Despite a summer of devastating hurricanes that caused billions of dollars in damage and job losses in at least three states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the U.S. GDP grew by 2.6 percent in the last quarter of 2017. This is lower than the 3-to-4 percent growth for which <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has aimed, but as I wrote in the book, 2.6 percent was still a welcome change from nearly a decade of slow growth.'These growth numbers were still astounding considering <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>inherited Obama's lethargic economy. In fact, the first quarter's weak growth was the last holdover from the Obama years because Trump's policies were just beginning to go into effect. In fact, the average growth for the last three quarters in 2017 was 2.97. Even with the first quarter included, Trump's first year ended less than half a percentage point away from his goal, which the media had declared impossible.'And as I mentioned to Terry last week, some economists are anticipating second quarter GDP growth this year to exceed 4 percent. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is estimating more than 4.5 percent growth in the second quarter.The remarkable success in our markets and economy are directly related to the Trump agenda. As I said at Nasdaq, the three major drivers are deregulation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and innovation.First, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>massive effort to cut government red tape has allow companies to focus on their businesses rather than paperwork and federal rules. As I wrote in Trump's America, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that the total economic impact of federal regulatory compliance is about $1.9 trillion a year. Between the Trump administration's ability to repeal 22 rules every one it has created and the Republican Congress's ability to scrap 15 expensive Obama-era regulations through the Congressional Review Act, American companies have saved billions.These businesses have been using these savings to expand their companies, increase hiring, and boost wages. This has helped lead us to the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years. In fact, the latest Bureau of Labor statistics indicate there are more open jobs than there are people looking for work in America. This is a wonderful problem to have.Similarly, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly lowered the corporate tax rate (as well as personal income taxes for most Americans), and this has led nearly 600 companies to give bonuses, raises, and better retirement benefits to their employees. In fact, the tax cuts have made the United States so competitive, more and more international companies are seeking to move into the United States.In addition to boosting employment and wages, the Trump agenda has allowed companies - especially the ones Nasdaq tracks - to focus on innovations that will further grow the economy and help make life better for Americans.Finally, along with creating more jobs, higher wages, and greater productivity, our strong economy has allowed us to use our economic strength to influence countries such as North Korea and China. This is exactly why <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>integrated the economy and trade into his National Security Strategy.As I mentioned to Terry at Nasdaq, the continued success of the economy and markets under the Trump-Republican agenda will be a decisive issue in the 2018 elections - and I believe it will start a 'red wave' in the Senate and allow Republicans to keep control of the House of Representatives.The reason is simple: The number one thing you can say about <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Republicans is that their agenda works.Your Friend, Newt Newt Gingrich P.S. My new book, Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback[3] is out and available for order.About Newt GingrichNewt Gingrich is well-known as the architect of the 'Contract with America' that led the Republican Party to victory in 1994 by capturing the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. After he was elected Speaker, he disrupted the status quo by moving power out of Washington and back to the American people.Gingrich Productions is a performance and production company featuring the work of Newt Gingrich and Callista Gingrich.

But there's another thing these tech giants aren't cutting: their growing business ties to the oil and gas industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When Microsoft held an all-staff meeting in September, an employee asked CEO Satya Nadella if it was ethical for the company to be selling its cloud computing services to fossil fuel companies, according to two other Microsoft employees who described the exchange on condition they not be named. Such partnerships, the worker told Nadella, were accelerating the oil companies' greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Microsoft and other tech giants have been competing with one another to strike lucrative partnerships with ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and other energy firms, in many cases supplying them not just with remote data storage but also artificial intelligence tools for pinpointing better drilling spots or speeding up refinery production.</p><p> The oil and gas industry is spending roughly $20 billion each year on cloud services, which accounts for about 10% of the total cloud market, according to Vivek Chidambaram, a managing director of Accenture's energy consultancy. It's not yet clear whether the extraction industry is getting its money's worth, although experts remain bullish about the application of advanced technology to oil and gas exploration.</p><p> Nadella sought to assuage employee concerns at the Sept. 12 meeting, first by reiterating Microsoft's internal efforts on environmental sustainability, according to the workers, who asked for anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking about an internal meeting. The employees said Nadella also defended Microsoft's energy partners, pointing out their investments in researching and developing more sustainable energy production methods.</p><p> \"There's no fossil fuel CEO who sits there and says, 'You know, I'm just gonna deny climate change,'\" Nadella said, according to the employees' transcript of his remarks. \"If anything, they're all saying, 'Let us have, in fact, the regulation, the pricing mechanisms that get us to this future.' \"</p><p>Microsoft said in an emailed statement Tuesday that it is \"focused on helping companies of all kinds become more efficient, including energy companies.\" It declined to comment on Nadella's remarks, which were part of a regularly scheduled \"all-hands\" gathering in which the CEO welcomes questions on a range of topics.</p><p> Less than a week after that exchange and days before a planned worldwide protest over climate change, Microsoft announced yet another major deal for its Azure cloud computing platform - this time with Chevron and oilfield services giant Schlumberger. The timing of the announcement ahead of the climate protest and United Nations climate action meetings angered some environmentally minded Microsoft workers and caught the attention of outsiders.</p><p> \"It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil,\" said Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a tweet that coincided with the Sept. 20 global climate strike. \"We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy.\"</p><p> After months of employee activism, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said he was pushing his company to the forefront on sustainability, committing it to have 100% of its energy use come from solar panels and other renewable energy by 2030. But he also defended Amazon's work with the oil and gas industry, arguing that \"we need to help them instead of vilify them.\"</p><p> Some experts say AI and cloud services could actually play a role in curbing emissions.</p><p> Denying cloud computing services to the oil and gas industry would do little to address the bigger problem of the world's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels, said Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington.</p><p> \"We would not want to collapse the fossil fuel industry,\" Prakash said. \"We would want a soft landing.\"</p><p> Big Tech</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-35327452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6H-DR11-DYFF-817S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 5, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The European Commission's two-year assessment found that fears the privacy framework would be \"the end of the world\" didn't materialize, she said. Seventy percent of Europeans have heard of the regulation but more awareness is needed, she said. The review found the EC approach was correct, with more companies using privacy by design as a competitive advantage, and the one-continent, one-law philosophy enabling more businesses, particularly small and mid-sized ones, to operate in Europe's single market. It included a \"serious to-do list,\" Jourova noted. One key issue is the resources available to national data protection authorities (DPAs). There was a 42% increase in staff and a 49% hike in budgets between 2016 and 2019, but the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and DPAs must boost cooperation to provide a pan-EU data protection culture, Jourova said. The EC is monitoring DPA resources, said Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders. It's possible some national authorities, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, that handle complex cases involving big tech companies might need more capacity and cross-border cooperation, he said. \"Consistent and efficient enforcement of the GDPR remains a priority,\" said European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiorowski. He proposed creating a shared pool of experts in the EDPB to help DPAs in complex and resource-heavy cases. The EC review was \"thorough but critical,\" said Computer and Communications Industry Association Europe Senior Policy Manager Alex Roure: Two years after becoming law, companies and consumers still \"lack clear guidance from enforcers which too often take diverging, national actions.\" The GDPR \"has failed to live up to its promise,\" proving to be a \"complicated, burdensome drain on Europe's digital economy,\" said Center for Data Innovation Senior Policy Analyst Eline Chivot. The review shines an \"unflattering lights\" on many shortcomings, yet the EC \"seems determined to double down by layering on even more rules.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607R-P361-JC8G-818F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 25, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The Digital Services Act (DSA) is intended to update the 2000 EU e-commerce directive, which set minimum liability standards for internet intermediaries and established \"safe harbor\" exemptions. Although work on the proposal is in an early stage, digital rights activists and some European Parliament members urge retaining the safe harbor provisions. The European Commission told us it intends to unveil a proposal for consultation in coming weeks, and a draft measure \"later this year.\"</p><p>The DSA is part of EC President Ursula von der Leyen's agenda to make Europe \"fit for the digital age.\" It calls for upgrading liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products to complete the digital single market.</p><p>The European Parliament analyzed the current intermediary liability regime, implementation gaps and main proposals for revising the system. The April 30 paper said the e-commerce directive isn't uniformly applied across the EU, and many areas are unclear, such as to what extent new online services such as social media companies fall within the definition of information society service providers that can benefit from safe harbor. The paper said academics and stakeholders want new clarification of whether digital services providers such as social networks and online marketplaces could benefit from safe harbor; there may be an opportunity to enshrine a \"Good Samaritan\" clause to motivate online intermediaries to better control the content they host.</p><p>EU lawmakers are setting out positions in own-initiative reports. COVID-19 \"exposed serious shortcomings in the ways platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are regulated in Europe,\" said Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) rapporteur Alex Agius Saliba, of the Socialists and Democrats and Malta. His draft report for the lead committee called for retaining safe harbor, and expanding the DSA to digital services, not just online platforms.</p><p>Illegal content should go through notice and action procedures based on intermediaries' duty of care, responded the Legal Affairs Committee. The current \"limited liability\" regime, where intermediaries are deemed liable and can be asked to remove content only when they have actual knowledge of the illegal activity, should be retained, wrote Patrick Breyer, of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and Germany. The idea is to have parliamentary reports adopted by September, he said.</p><p>Intermediary liability provisions should remain intact, emailed European Digital Rights Senior Policy Adviser Jan Penfrat. \"No matter how well-intentioned, threatening hosting intermediaries with legal liability for user-uploaded content will inevitably lead platforms for remove or block any content that could potentially be considered illegal anywhere in the EU to avoid the legal uncertainty and risk,\" with negative effects on free speech. EDRi expects opposition to the proposal from those who believe that big tech platforms \"should do more\" to fight hate speech and disinformation but aren't sure how to achieve that, he said. EDRi wants large commercial platforms to be required to be more transparent about how they manage online content. Google and Facebook didn't comment this week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY6-SW51-DYRJ-00M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 18, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But does that mean anything?\" He said the FCC lacks jurisdiction; the FTC lacks three of its five commissioners, complicating major action; and Congress seems unlikely to act for now.</p><p>News reports indicate the political environment for \"big digital platform companies, particularly Facebook and Google, has suddenly turned negative and the companies for the first time face real threats of regulation and antitrust action, similar to those they already face in Europe and other countries,\" said New Street Research (NSR) analysts in an investor note Sunday, which cited their adviser Blair Levin. \"The reports are accurate in noting the voices of criticism span a broad political spectrum, which often is the precursor to a significant government action. Nonetheless, we don't see the volume or breadth of the commentary leading to action.\"</p><p>\"For investors, the discussion to date is more noise than signal,\" the NSR analysts said. \"The threats are far more likely to arise in other countries or through private antitrust action. Further, we see no signs that governments in the United States are likely to act in ways that provide potential competitors to the data platforms advantages that improve their own prospects for competing with such platforms.\"</p><p>Brake agreed. \"Despite all the noise, we are unlikely to see a historic shift in antitrust thinking or serious regulation any time soon,\" he said. \"Demagoguery and the magic wand of 'gatekeeper' went a long way in the net neutrality debate, but I don't see those tactics carrying as well against the consumer welfare standard. This doesn't mean all is well. This new narrative poses a major threat to the advancement of pro-innovation, pro-growth policies around the world. Continued denigration of the most successful U.S. companies will feed the headwinds, especially with growing nationalism and increasingly protectionist policies gaining traction abroad.\"</p><p>Open Society Foundations Fellow Gigi Sohn said she generally agrees \"there's not going to be much action in the near term,\" though she called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) a possible exception. \"It's got bipartisan support, sympathetic victims, horrific crimes\" and \"the tech companies have gone from 'No and Hell No,' to 'let's work together,'\" she said. \"So it's a near-term possibility.\"</p><p>Longer term, Sohn said momentum is building for antitrust changes to constrain market consolidation and harmful practices across industry. \"Something needs to be done to antitrust laws to reflect reality,\" said Sohn, a former aide to then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. She also said privacy remains a big concern. \"People really do care about their privacy; they just don't know what to do about it.\" She backs a \"level playing field\" for both broadband and edge providers, an approach she said wouldn't put edge providers out of business despite their regulatory fears.</p><p>\"Google and Facebook face more serious government accountability risk than most appreciate,\" emailed Scott Cleland, chairman of NetCompetition, which is backed by broadband interests. \"They are too big to be unaccountable. Big is not bad, but big unchecked power is bad. This obvious bad problem has rapidly crystalized, but solutions remain embryonic. ... The single biggest solution and accountability risk would involve antitrust cartel enforcement of Google and Facebook for apparently dividing up the digital advertising market in 2014, when they abruptly stopping fiercely competing directly with each other in social and search advertising, and then they rapidly benefited from expanding their joint share of digital advertising revenue growth to over 95% in a little over two years.\" Google and Facebook didn't comment.</p><p>Sohn suggested vested interests may be helping fuel the edge regulation speculation. \"I'm suspicious that certain opponents of net neutrality have been very eager to push this meme, while at the same time avoiding scrutiny for their own actions,\" she said. NSR offered a similar view: \"Google, Facebook, Amazon, as well as Microsoft and Apple are among the largest companies in the world and their rise has led to the decline of others, some of whom might wish to use government to stem the tide.\"</p><p>Cleland said edge providers largely have themselves to blame. \"Consider: their reported election role in Russian fake news, fake ads and fake objectivity; their reported societal role in enabling hate speech and hate ads; their reported political role in opposing bipartisan SESTA legislation that would tweak their Section 230 immunity from liability to not apply to enabling child sex trafficking;

The special advisors - CoRe editorial board member Professor Heike Schweitzer, Professor Jacques Cr\u00e9mer, and Assistant Professor Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye - are working on a report to be delivered by 31 March 2019.<sup>1</sup> In January 2019, the European Commission is also organising a conference to discuss the topic with a broad variety of contributors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that the current Commission has already entered the final year of its mandate, Vestager\u2019s initiative could be seen as her attempt to shape the enforcement agenda of her successor (in case she would not get re-appointed for another term).</p><p>For those anticipating the special advisors\u2019 recommendations, it is worthwhile having a look at the findings of a recent academic report reflecting on the implications of digitisation for German competition law enforcement, particularly against abuse of market power.<sup>2</sup> This report, commissioned by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, was also co-authored by Professor Schweitzer. One of its most thought-provoking proposals relates to merger control. The report finds that the substantive test, the so-called SIEC-test (\u2018significant impediment of effective competition\u2019), inadequately captures strategies of dominant undertakings to systematically acquire small innovative start-ups with considerable potential to become future rivals. The authors of the report therefore suggest supplementing the SIEC-test to enable the Bundeskartellamt to exceptionally take into account such a purchasing strategy (as demonstrated by previous acquisitions) and its overall effects on competition.</p><p>The European Commission appears to identify a similar challenge. One of the panels of its January conference is devoted to the question whether there is scope to apply theories of harm based on a loss of innovation and/or loss of \u2018potential competition\u2019 more often. Whereas the German report does not single out concentrations in the digital economy, the Commission does refer to \u2018digital mergers\u2019 in this context.</p><p>Concerns about powerful incumbents gobbling up potential competitive threats are not novel and come into play in multiple sectors, but they have recently been raised most prominently in relation to the five major tech companies - Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.<sup>3</sup> Classical examples include Google\u2019s acquisition of YouTube, DoubleClick, and Waze; Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, Oculus VR, WhatsApp, and tbh; and Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Diapers.com and Zappos.</p><p>Arguably, often such acquisitions do no raise significant competition issues, at least not right away. The ability of start-ups to sell to an incumbent motivates investment and thus inherently spurs innovation. Yet in some instances, there are legitimate concerns about the loss of potential competition and innovation. Identifying such cases, however, poses significant difficulties.</p><p>Firstly, traditional product market definition will often lead competition authorities astray since potential for future competition will typically originate in adjacent, niche markets. The assessment of the 2012 concentration between Facebook and Instagram by the US Federal Trade Commission and the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is a case in point. The assessment of both authorities focused on the market for photo-taking and photo-editing apps, where the merged entity would still face significant competition. The OFT even discarded the potential for a competitive relationship between the two parties in online advertising because Instagram did not generate revenues from advertising at that time.<sup>4</sup></p><p>The European Commission\u2019s recent assessment of Apple\u2019s acquisition of Shazam invites similar criticism. The parties submitted that the concentration was motivated by Apple\u2019s desire to enrich its services with Shazam\u2019s music and visual recognition features. The competitive assessment, however, focused almost exclusively on the undertaking\u2019s limited horizontal overlaps in the markets for digital streaming services and the licensing of music data.<sup>5</sup></p><p>To better capture broader and potential competitive relationships, some commentators have suggested to replace the lens of narrowly defined, functional market definitions with other metrics.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Secondly, it is inherently challenging for competition authorities to identify concentrations that may lessen potential competition. To overcome the information asymmetries between the acquirer and the authority, more extensive use could be made of internal documents, market actions and reactions by the incumbent, and past transactions signalling a defensive \u201ckiller acquisition\u201d motive.<sup>7</sup> This is where the proposal for the amended SIEC-test by the German report fits in.</p><p>The proposal to subject dominant (tech) undertakings to stricter merger control is controversial but is certainly worthy of further discussion. One notable practical objection would be that it risks injecting an abuse of a dominant position assessment into merger control proceedings, subject to strict and short deadlines.</p><p>Competition law challenges arising from the digital world are also at the heart of the first contribution in this issue. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The SSNIP Test and Zero-Pricing</emphasis>, Daniel Mandrescu examines the complexities of defining the relevant market in (future) cases involving online platforms. Andr\u00e1s T\u00f3th discusses how national competition authorities can more easily and rapidly adapt to a fast-changing world. And in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hospital Mergers and the Incorporation of Non-Competition Concerns</emphasis>, Nicole Rosenboom explores how public interest concerns such as affordability, quality of care, and access to care can be taken into account in the assessment of hospital mergers.</p><p>The reports section of this issue provides an update of the latest competition law and regulatory law developments at the national level (Belgium, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden) as well as a commentary on the European Commission\u2019s proposal for a Directive on Unfair Practices in the Food Supply Chain. We also have a case note on the General Court\u2019s judgment in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis> and its implications for the doctrine of parental liability under EU competition law.
