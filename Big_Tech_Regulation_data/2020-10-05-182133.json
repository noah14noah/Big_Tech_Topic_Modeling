Jesus Garcia:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today Congressman Jess \"Chuy\" Garca (IL-04) and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) introduced the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act, a bill to limit the revenue that large non-financial companies can derive from financial activity. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act restricts big tech's involvement in banking, and guards against banks' ability to manipulate the price of commodities.</p><p>\"As a community organizer and life-long advocate for working families, I have seen first-hand how the growth of monopolies, mega-corporations and big banks has exacerbated income inequality and threatened our nation's economic stability. Many families are still feeling the effects of the 2008 economic crash in Chicago's Little Village,\" Rep. Garca said.</p><p>\"Whenever we allow the line between banking and commerce to blur, working-class families suffer. Big banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley have already been caught manipulating everything from electricity rates to oil and aluminum prices. Simultaneously, big tech companies like Facebook and Google are moving to the financial services sector where they currently evade existing banking regulations. Congress has a responsibility to protect working families and keep banking and commerce separate; that's why I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act and the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which I introduced last month,\" Rep. Garca continued.</p><p>\"Time and again we have seen that big banks and big tech companies cannot be trusted to put people before profit,\" Rep. Tlaib said. \"Working-class families in my district are still struggling to recover from the 2008 recession caused by corporate greed and recklessness. By introducing the Market Manipulation Act, I hope to ensure that what progress we have been able to make is safeguarded from the threat of allowing an unchecked, unregulated blurring of lines between banking and commerce that has already resulted in examples of clear manipulation, discrimination, and privacy violations.\"</p><p>A fact sheet about the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act can be found here.</p><p>The bill's introduction comes one week after Google announced a new initiative to offer checking accounts to consumers and regulators opened an investigation into discrimination by Apple's new credit card. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act is part of a package of bills strengthening the separation between banking and commerce, which Rep. Garca announced on the 20th anniversary of landmark financial deregulation.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123326391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ8-NKG1-DYTH-G2BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia (IL-04) and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) introduced the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act, a bill to limit the revenue that large non-financial companies can derive from financial activity. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act restricts big tech's involvement in banking, and guards against banks' ability to manipulate the price of commodities.</p><p>\"As a community organizer and life-long advocate for working families, I have seen first-hand how the growth of monopolies, mega-corporations and big banks has exacerbated income inequality and threatened our nation's economic stability. Many families are still feeling the effects of the 2008 economic crash in Chicago's Little Village,\" Rep. Garcia said.</p><p>\"Whenever we allow the line between banking and commerce to blur, working-class families suffer. Big banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley have already been caught manipulating everything from electricity rates to oil and aluminum prices. Simultaneously, big tech companies like Facebook and Google are moving to the financial services sector where they currently evade existing banking regulations. Congress has a responsibility to protect working families and keep banking and commerce separate; that's why I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act and the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which I introduced last month,\" Rep. Garcia continued.</p><p>\"Time and again we have seen that big banks and big tech companies cannot be trusted to put people before profit,\" Rep. Tlaib said. \"Working-class families in my district are still struggling to recover from the 2008 recession caused by corporate greed and recklessness. By introducing the Market Manipulation Act, I hope to ensure that what progress we have been able to make is safeguarded from the threat of allowing an unchecked, unregulated blurring of lines between banking and commerce that has already resulted in examples of clear manipulation, discrimination, and privacy violations.\"</p><p>A fact sheet about the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act can be found here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://edit-chuygarcia.house.gov/sites/chuygarcia.house.gov/files/Protecting%20Consumers%20Against%20Market%20Manipulation%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\">https://edit-chuygarcia.house.gov/sites/chuygarcia.house.gov/files/Protecting%20Consumers%20Against%20Market%20Manipulation%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf</url>).</p><p>The bill's introduction comes one week after Google announced a new initiative to offer checking accounts to consumers and regulators opened an investigation into discrimination by Apple's new credit card. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act is part of a package of bills strengthening the separation between banking and commerce, which Rep. Garcia announced on the 20th anniversary of landmark financial deregulation.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6935249 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6935249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJS-HTW1-DYG2-R3XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Jesus Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today Congressman Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia (IL-04) and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) introduced the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act, a bill to limit the revenue that large non-financial companies can derive from financial activity. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act restricts big tech's involvement in banking, and guards against banks' ability to manipulate the price of commodities.</p><p>\"As a community organizer and life-long advocate for working families, I have seen first-hand how the growth of monopolies, mega-corporations and big banks has exacerbated income inequality and threatened our nation's economic stability. Many families are still feeling the effects of the 2008 economic crash in Chicago's Little Village,\" Rep. Garcia said.</p><p>\"Whenever we allow the line between banking and commerce to blur, working-class families suffer. Big banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley have already been caught manipulating everything from electricity rates to oil and aluminum prices. Simultaneously, big tech companies like Facebook and Google are moving to the financial services sector where they currently evade existing banking regulations. Congress has a responsibility to protect working families and keep banking and commerce separate; that's why I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act and the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which I introduced last month,\" Rep. Garcia continued.</p><p>\"Time and again we have seen that big banks and big tech companies cannot be trusted to put people before profit,\" Rep. Tlaib said. \"Working-class families in my district are still struggling to recover from the 2008 recession caused by corporate greed and recklessness. By introducing the Market Manipulation Act, I hope to ensure that what progress we have been able to make is safeguarded from the threat of allowing an unchecked, unregulated blurring of lines between banking and commerce that has already resulted in examples of clear manipulation, discrimination, and privacy violations.\"</p><p>A fact sheet about the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act can be found here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://chuygarcia.house.gov/sites/chuygarcia.house.gov/files/Protecting%20Consumers%20Against%20Market%20Manipulation%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\">https://chuygarcia.house.gov/sites/chuygarcia.house.gov/files/Protecting%20Consumers%20Against%20Market%20Manipulation%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf</url>).</p><p>The bill's introduction comes one week after Google announced a new initiative to offer checking accounts to consumers and regulators opened an investigation into discrimination by Apple's new credit card. The Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act is part of a package of bills strengthening the separation between banking and commerce, which Rep. Garcia announced on the 20th anniversary of landmark financial deregulation.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6932678 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6932678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJB-KH31-JC11-10VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><timeReceived>8:22 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unfortunately, the tech industry does not hold digital apps to the same standard,\" said Johnson.</p><p>\"For too long, apps have been allowed to serve as hubs for bullying, pornography and other types of content that jeopardize children's safety and well-being. It's time for Big Tech to step-up and do its part to make sure children are protected from dangerous and exploitative app content.\"</p><p>\"Salt Lake County police arrested 30 online predators in four days last month alone, in a crackdown on cybercrimes. Parents need accurate and complete information about the apps available to their kids and user-friendly parental controls to protect their children,\" said McAdams.</p><p>\"This resolution calls on tech companies to provide that.

Jason Smith, R-Missouri, issued the following Capitol Report column:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent weeks, big tech companies have intensified their attacks on conservatives' free speech. These massive corporations can do this because they have built considerable control over all of the information Americans view online. The vast majority of internet searches in the United States, over 88%, begin on Goggle's website. Millions of us wake up and check our social media platforms, like Twitter or Facebook, to see what happened while we were sleeping. One of the reasons these companies have been able to rise to their meteoric heights is because of protections extended through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The section essentially states that these companies cannot be held responsible for the content of others on their platforms. It was intended to keep the internet free and open, but it is being abused by these companies to limit free speech and control what we do and don't see on the internet.</p><p>Earlier this week, it was reported that Google planned to ban The Federalist, a conservative publication, over readers' comments left on their website. Google said it would no longer run ads on their website. This decision shows not only the sheer power Google wields online, but also the raw hypocrisy that exists in Silicon Valley. Apparently, Google is not okay with websites like The Federalist and their conservative readers sharing their perspectives, but their left-leaning employees have no problem protecting free speech they agree with. Sadly, this selective enforcement is not limited to just Google. Twitter has, on several occasions, hid or flagged tweets made by President Trump for rhetoric they simply don't agree with. However, those regulating free speech at Twitter have made no effort to silence any other world leader on its platform, like Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. These tech companies are widely inconsistent about how and when they enforce their policies. They must be held accountable for consistently taken disproportionate action to silence conservative voices they disagree with.</p><p>In Missouri, we know that these massive companies cannot continue to violate our Constitutional rights. To ensure they don't, Senator Josh Hawley recently introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act. This bill prevents the Section 230 protections from being provided to online companies unless they clearly detail their content moderation policies and pledge to enforce them in good faith. Under this legislation, when Americans feel these companies are not living up to their end of the deal, they can sue for $5,000 and attorney's fees. Silencing free speech is illegal in the United States, and it is something the American people will never accept. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and others, must understand that they are not too big to be held accountable.</p><p>The past few weeks have shown just how powerful these massive tech companies have become. Yet, the threat towards the free speech of conservative voices is not only a fight playing out online but also in newsrooms at some of the largest and oldest publications in this country. After having published an op-ed written by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, The New York Times faced a firestorm of liberal criticism. The paper's own staff were not prepared to read a viewpoint with which they did not agree. So, rather than engage in debate on the ideas, they complained that the opinions expressed by Senator Cotton amounted to violence. Words are not violence, and the views expressed by Senator Cotton on the looting and rioting are held by many Americans. Yet after initially supporting the piece's publication, the publisher of the New York Times later bowed down before the mob and fired the Head of the Opinion desk who allowed the opinion piece to be published.</p><p>We are entering a dangerous time in America. We used to believe that the best medicine for bad free speech was more free speech. Yet today, it seems that the liberal mob wants to burn books and silence voices. The day our voices become silenced; is the day we stop being Americans.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7149864 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7149864</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605S-2921-JC11-13DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><timeReceived>7:31 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 20, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 10th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. All eyes on Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell this morning. He is testifying this morning, hiss prepared remarks will come out of the embargo in 30 minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will bring you those remarks at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. They may very well move markets. Ahead of the testimony, futures are pointing to a lower opening for stock prices this morning. It's been pretty steady are the markets await Jay Powell. Futures indicating a decline of 56 points on the Dow, 6-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ down 15. This after a mixed day on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow edged lower while the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 finished with modest gains. All three major indices less than one percent below their record highs. 43 points higher on the NASDAQ yesterday. Global markets this morning, little changed to lower, European indices are mostly lower, take a look but it's a fractional move. FT-100 down six, CAC quarante is up three and the DAX Index lower by 56.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed moves there as well. As you see, really just fractional. New U.S.-China trade talks on the table. Both sides holding a constructive phone call we're told. We've got the details on that call that took place yesterday. Netflix says farewell to Friends. The hit show has a new home for streaming. We'll tell you where. And then celebrating the women's World Cup victory. Fans already lining the streets of New York for a big parade.</p><p>All stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: China called yesterday moving slowly but it's all about the Fed, isn't it?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC CHARITABLE FOUNDATION: At least they're talking but in half an hour we're going to get advance remarks and that could be a nothingburger though because I think they're going to be carefully chosen words and we may not learn much more than wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In the morning note of J.P. Morgan this morning they basically write what you've been saying for weeks and that is, it's not about what the Fed is going to do, it's about questioning whether or not any cut in rates really going to move the needle on things.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. It doesn't actually have any stimulus or any meaningful impact to our economy or the global economy. It just might signal that the Fed's worried and that alone is bad news if they cut.</p><p>BELL: Absolutely. You usually need to see about a five percentage point cut to see any stimulus to the economy, Johnny Ellis said that and that's what we got in 2001 and 2007 and we don't even have that now.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: If there is a cut, it could almost be symbolic that the Fed is interested in keeping the growth going and they're willing to make a concession to see if that happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I still question why we're talking about rate cuts when you got unemployment story that's at a 51-year low, and three percent still growth in the first quarter, but, of course, we are on the doorstep of second-quarter earnings and you're expecting a decline in S&amp;P earnings.</p><p>BELL: Right. So the current consensus estimate is for a decline in 1.8 percent. I think it will come in better than that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do.</p><p>BELL: Or be slightly positive. Sales expectations are also very low for 3.7 percent positive growth and that's coming up five percent -- 5-1/2 percent the last two quarters and 9-1/2 percent the four quarters before that. So I think that's becoming a lot better and that will help the bottom line.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And I've harped on this before, the strong dollar is going to weigh on those foreign sales for those S&amp;P 500 who have sales abroad. So - -</p><p>BELL: Absolutely. 43 percent of the S&amp;P 500 revenues come from overseas with eight percent of that coming from Asia. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an important point because Europe has been really hard- pressed to generate any growth there and we don't know really what the number is in China.</p><p>BELL: Yes. You're starting to see a slowdown in Europe, that is being driven by the slowdown in China. Germany is a huge manufacturing economy obviously and they send machines for automobiles to China and China is just not buying them, so the ripple effect is starting to occur in the slowdown that we're having in China which is being impacted significantly by trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're talking about all of this this morning. And joining the conversation, House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise is here. The host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Don't miss a moment of it. And right now we're taking a look at our top story and that is Jay Powell on Capitol Hill. Investors are keeping a close eye on the Fed Chair's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee today.</p><p>And then, of course, Thursday, he'll speak with the Senate. His comments are embargoed for the next 25 minutes but we will have those comments at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We will bring them to you because they may very well maybe market moving. Markets will be paying specific attention to see if Powell indicates signs that we will see a rate cut in the future whether it's July, September, we don't know.</p><p>Joining me right now is the former Chief Economic Adviser for George W. Bush, Ed Lazear is with me. Ed, it's great to see you. How are you?</p><p>ED LAZEAR, MORRIS ARNOLD COX SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Doing very well, thanks for having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what are you expecting from Jay Powell today?</p><p>LAZEAR: Well, I think your earlier comments are probably right. I guess he'd be cautious. It's not that he doesn't know what he's planning to do. Obviously, they're -- you know, there are going to be some numbers that come out between now and decision time. But I think Powell is a guy who actually listens carefully to the other members of the committee. He is not someone who necessarily makes up his mind in advance and then tries to persuade everybody else.</p><p>So, I think the only uncertainty that there is between now and then is how other members feel about the state of the economy and I think he will be cautious because I think he is going to want to hear how those things play out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, let's talk about state of the economy because that's what we're debating. We just came off of a quarter that showed 3.1 percent growth, we've got unemployment at a 51-year low. How do you characterize things right now, the backdrop?</p><p>LAZEAR: Well, I think things look good. But the reason I'm slightly hesitant is because it does look like we are getting close to the top and the obvious indicator of that is actually the labor market, that's where I always look first. If you look at the labor market, we know there are a number of things going on. First of all, job creation is still good, if you look at the numbers, 171,000 over the past three months is still well above what we need to keep up with population growth.</p><p>But it is considerably down from where we were last year. So, it looks like we're getting closer to the peak. The employment rate is pretty much level. And the other thing that we look at is wage growth. Wage growth is kind of right on target right now. What you expect for wage growth when you're at the peak of an economy is that wages grow at the rate of inflation plus the rate of productivity which is right about in low threes, just about what we're seeing right now.</p><p>So, things look good but they look kind of like we're stable, we're at the top. The other thing I would say, Maria, is that if you look -- if you look at other indicators, the good news -- the best news actually is investment. So investment is still strong, I think we had six percent growth in the first quarter. That's very important. We're still above the three percent that we need to kind of keep pace with long-term growth rates, that's good.</p><p>The extent that there are negatives, it would be flattening in the housing market, flattening in industrial production. Again, those are indicators that we're getting close to the top.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, the Journal reported a couple of months ago that CapEx, it was up 20 percent and now it's only up three percent.</p><p>LAZEAR: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're saying -- is that what you're talking about when you say investment?</p><p>LAZEAR: Yes. That's -- so -- right, exactly. So, if you -- now, when you say it was up, remember, the reason it's up is you're comparing it to the previous two years. If you look at the last couple of years of the Obama administration, I don't I mean to be political but it was during that period of time, we -- you know, capital expenditure was quite low, we didn't have good investment during that period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was because of the rules and the regulations I think.</p><p>LAZEAR: Well, I agree. You know, it wasn't like President Obama was the most pro-market president, although I'll tell you, you know, compared with what we're hearing right now, he looks like Margaret Thatcher. So, you know, I -- we do have some uncertainty going forward in terms of the politics of it. But, again, back to the numbers, if you just think about what we're seeing right now, the growth in investment is still very strong relative to where it's been.</p><p>So that's still OK. The best indicator, you know, as I've told you before, this is what I believe is the best indicator of future growth is the market. And if you look at the S&amp;P 500, change in the S&amp;P 500 over the past three or six months, it's indicating about two percent growth for the next four quarters. So, you know, two percent is not break-out growth but it's not recession either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So. How contingent is this growth story on a deal with China? I mean, so we had talks resume yesterday. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin spoke with their Chinese counterparts on the phone yesterday, both sides say that they're trying to get negotiations back on track, the U.S. is now allowing sales to go to Chinese telecom giant Huawei if there's no national security threat.</p><p>But, look, this has been slow-moving, we know that the Chinese reneged on all the important issues that the U.S. wanted in that deal. Do you think we'll see a deal and how contingent is U.S. growth on a deal?</p><p>LAZEAR: I do think we'll see a deal. But I also do not suffer delusions of grandeur on that either. I -- when you look at China and you ask how much does it mean to the United States? Obviously, it's important, China is a huge economy, second largest economy in the world. But if you ask how much do we export to China as a proportion of our GDP, it's less than one percent. So, suppose we would double that, that would be a, you know, that would be enormous.</p><p>Supposed we were to double that in the next year, what you're talking about is the equivalent of four months growth in GDP for the United States. So, it matters, that's not trivial but it's not -- it's not going to just transform our whole economy. So, I think when people look at these things and they say, oh my gosh, trade with China, you know, that's killing the economy. I don't buy that. I think the, you know, I'm not a fan of tariffs. I don't like the antitrade policies in the first place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LAZEAR: But I don't think that that has had a tremendously negative effect on our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, people have recognized the national security threat as it relates to China.</p><p>LAZEAR: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And for so many years, CEOs were just so interested in getting a foothold to sell to 1.4 billion people in China, they forgot to protect their own products. And now we recognize that the Chinese have stolen that intellectual property and are beginning to beat America at its own game. Look, we're going to continue following that but I got to ask about this White House summit. They're holding a social media summit tomorrow at the White House.</p><p>Big tech leaders not on the invite list, many who have -- will be there have faced intent censorship. Last month I spoke with the President about his plans for big technology. Listen to what he said. I found it interesting. I got to get your cake.</p><p>LAZEAR: OK. OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives and they're going to do this right up to the 2020 election.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): They make it very hard for people to join me on Twitter and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message, they make it -- it's incredible. Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are you going to do about it? What do -- I mean, these companies have an enormous amount of power if they could even stop the President of the free world.</p><p>TRUMP: Twitter is just terrible what they do, they don't let you get the word -- I've had so many people come to me, sir, I can't join you on Twitter. I see what' happening 100 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you -- would you rather see competition or do you want to see legislation coming down to actually --</p><p>TRUMP: Well, you may need legislation in order to create competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's what technology companies are doing, what they did to you, is that legal? Are they breaking the law, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I don't know whether or not, but I tell you what, they should be sued.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They should be sued. And then he said after that, we might sue them. We were talking about Google in particular. And he said, legislation will lead to competition. Ed, what do you think about this, regulation on the horizon for big tech?</p><p>LAZEAR: Well, I don't know if it's on the horizon. I always worry about regulation, you know, I can think back a decade or even 15 years ago when we were worried about Microsoft taking over the world, you know, there is always a technology that we're worried about taking over the information space. And what we've seen in that field, the good thing about that field is that because it is so dynamic, you do see new things coming in all the time. So competition tends to be pretty strong even on its own --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LAZEAR: -- in the tech area. And, you know, there -- look, there's plenty of competition on the airwaves, you know, Fox does -- has one take on things and if you watch CNN, you're going to get a completely different take on it. So, probably shouldn't have said that on your -- on your network but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, no. You're right because CNN has a definite different take for sure. We're covering the issues that we think are important to the American people. So I want to end where it began and that is the Federal Reserve. Ed, real quick. If the Fed cut rates this year, do they look less independent because of the President's prodding and taunting of Jay Powell?</p><p>LAZEAR: You know, obviously, President Trump is a bit more public in his criticism than other presidents have been this the past. This is not a new phenomenon. If you ask Alan Greenspan, you know, whether he suffered criticism, pressure from other presidents --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Maybe behind the scenes. Yes.</p><p>LAZEAR: Yes. And he'll tell you that he did. I think the issue here is the Fed has an important job, and its job is to maintain low inflation rates and to make sure that we have stable employment, and that's their job and I think that that's why most economist favoring independent Fed and I think that, you know, I'd like to see that continue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Ed, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>LAZEAR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ed Lazear joining us. Coming up. A new home for Friends. Warner Media's upcoming streaming service HBO Max has its first big get. Then, team USA. The World Cup parade steps off today in New York City celebrating the women's national team's big win. We'll take you there live. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Technology and media giants headed to Sun Valley, Idaho today for a big conference that will draw everybody from Apple CEO Tim Cook to Disney Head Bob Iger, and then some. Jackie DeAngelis is there on the ground with the very latest. Jackie, good morning to you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you Maria. That's right, it's going to be the who's who of tech and tech and also media, they're coming together to have conversations about the industry but they also talk about politics, sports, philanthropy, and they bike and they hike here. And deals have been made in the past too. So this year, all eyes are on Shari Redstone because she arrived yesterday and everyone's wondering if there's going to be an announcement about a merger between Viacom and CBS.</p><p>And the second aspect of this is T-Mobile and Sprint. That's a merger waiting for regulatory approval. Obviously a lot of eyes on dish waiting to see if it's going to scoop some of those assets to set the pathway forward for that deal to happen. So, people are looking not only to try to grab a glimpse of Shari Redstone but Warren Buffett was spotted here yesterday, Sheryl Sandberg, Bobby Kotick, Lachlan Murdoch, the CEO of Fox Corp, parent of Fox Business as well.</p><p>Tim Cook, Jack Dorsey, you name it, they're not going to be at the social media summit tomorrow because they are all here in Idaho. But the theme this year, part of the conversation is about tech and media coming together and how those tech companies are sitting on a lot of cash and potentially looking to acquire and scoop up some of these media assets. Speaking of -- I want to give some streaming news because Netflix has announced that Friends will actually leave its streaming service, Friends is going to have a seat on Warner Media's new service that's launching next spring.</p><p>And it just gives you an idea of how things are moving along, within this space, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie. Great stuff. We'll be watching your reporting all day and thanks so much. Jackie DeAngelis in Idaho this morning. Coming up. Markets are waiting on the Fed. Chairman Jay Powell set to released his prepared testimony in 11 minutes, just before his testimony, before the House Financial Services Committee. We will bring you those comments as soon as the embargo is lifted and that's 10 minutes.</p><p>Then in women in the workforce. I'm speaking to one CEO who's worked with big names like Google and General Mills, now launching her own FinTech startup. She'll join us on set. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Women in the workforce. A new FinTech startup looking to revolutionize the payments industry with the first ever direct sales force made up of women. Park Place Payments launching today after announcing it's raised more than a million dollars in seed funding. Joining us right now is the founder and CEO, Park Place Payments Founder and CEO, Sam Ettus. Same, it's great to have you on the show.</p><p>SAM ETTUS, FOUNDER AND CEO, PARK PLACE PAYMENTS: Thanks so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel like FinTech in this specific corner of FinTech payments is all the rage. A lot of companies are trying to really get that consumer to get digital payments through them. How are you going to compete?</p><p>ETTUS: Well, nobody is using cash anymore. So, as payments grows, the interesting thing is that the industry really hasn't evolved as much as it should have on the service side. So what we found is that all of the merchants and business owners are desperately seeking transparency and this industry has been functioning a lot more like the used car sales industry where everyone is charging a different rate, there's all these hidden fees.</p><p>So, we've brought transparency through the sales the force of professional women who are incredible and these are women who formerly really have been on the sidelines and it's this on top labor force of women who maybe only had alternatives like selling makeup and skincare to their friends and now they're selling financial services in their communities.</p><p>BELL: How do you get them comfortable with selling financial services because it can be a daunting industry?</p><p>ETTUS: Well, we have an online course, it's called Park Place Academy and we train women from across the country to sell in their ZIP code. So once they have the sales skills, it's really -- it's all about relationship building. And so, these are relationships most of them have already had. They have relationships with their dentist, with their toy store, with their bookstore. Everyone in their community, they're hair salon.</p><p>And so they're selling into their community and then they become almost like the payment's mayor of that ZIP code. They come to the Chamber of Commerce meetings, everyone knows them. And it's actually really fun to get to know all the business owners in your community and you're helping Main Street at the same time as you're making a lot of money.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Sam, how did you find the money-raising process to be and do you think there is a lot of money out there for these types of FinTech start-ups?</p><p>ETTUS: I do. I think that you really have to be smart about it. For us, we really focus on angel investors who were very seasoned. We didn't want to raise easy money in this first round because they didn't know if we actually need to raise money again next year. It's not a capital intensive industry. So what we did was we focused on these very seasoned institutional invest -- sorry, angel investors not Uncle Bob, it was all people who have a lot of experience, who care passionately about not only making money but helping women at the same time.</p><p>So, it was actually a really great process. I would say that our conversion rate of people we talked to, to people who gave was very high. And it's because it's really exciting to be part of a company that's, you know, doing really well and doing good at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stuff. Yes.</p><p>BELL: I was just going to say as female, it's sometimes hard to get those meetings, so with the angel servers, so how did you make that happen? That's pretty impressive.</p><p>ETTUS: Well, I was really focused on getting a very diverse group of investors. So we wanted people of color and we wanted more than half women and we got there. So, it's really just word of mouth and networking and talking to anyone you can talk to and making sure that you have people in the round who are believing in you in the mission, and also care about investing in something that's going to do really well.</p><p>And, you know, women have a greater return investment in terms of investment money than men do, if you look at the stats. And so, I think people are realizing that investing in women is investing smart.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Samantha, congrats.</p><p>ETTUS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Samantha Ettus joining us there. Coming up. Markets are waiting on the Fed. Chairman Jay Powell set to release his prepared testimony just moments from now, just ahead of the appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. We will have the embargoed comments right after this break. Stay with us.</p><p>Then, the battle for the border. A new data shows a dip in apprehensions along the southwest border last month. What officials say is driving that decline. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it Wednesday, July 10th. Your top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news this morning, we are waiting on Fed Chairman Jay Powell. His prepared remarks are out right now as day one of his two-day testimony is about to get underway. Ahead of the testimony, futures right now pointing to a lower opening. We want to get right to Edward Lawrence, he's got the embargoed news. Edward.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes, Maria. The Federal Reserve Chairman will tell the House Financial Services Committee the economy remains solid, but the 3.1 percent GDP growth, he says, that we saw on the first quarter, business investment had slowed, he says, in the second quarter. Powell will tell the committee that since the last fed meeting, in uncertainty over trade and concerns about the slowing global economy weighs on the U.S. economy.</p><p>He says that inflation pressures will look muted going forward. Now the Fed estimates that inflation is running about 1.5 percent for PCE, it's about 1.6 percent for core PCE. He says the Fed will carefully monitor both inflation and outside risk to the U.S. economy. Now Powell mentions specifically trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit has possible policy issues that need to be resolved to fix that uncertainty in this market.</p><p>He also will acknowledge that several members of the FOMC saw a more -- or a case for a more accommodative monetary policy going forward. His testimony focuses on that inflation and crosscurrents in the economy. And you could really see it walking a line in the testimony where there is a case to keep the rate exactly where it is, also a case to see that the rate could be cut, the Federal Reserve Chairman is clearly walking that line, maneuvering a very divided Federal Reserve. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Edward. Yes, we're parsing through these comments now and on the downside, he says since the May meeting, crosscurrents have remerged, creating greater uncertainty. So these crosscurrents he's talking about or the slowing global economy and the uncertainties over trade, let's take a look at markets here and see if we've had -- we've got a turn complete around. We had a negative performance before these embargoed came out and we're looking at now the futures pointing to a gain in the -- in the -- in the -- in the market. Dow Industrials up 14, S&amp;P up three, NASDAQ up 20.</p><p>Real quick, Dagen McDowell, your take on these comments that were embargoed until now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He touches on Jay Powell does what we've been talking about on this program if there's some worry spots in the U.S. economy, it would be housing investment declining in the first quarter, and decreasing again in second quarter, and also manufacturing output declining in first quarter and decreasing again in the second quarter, those are the two worrisome spots in U.S. economy.</p><p>It looks like he's, again, laying the groundwork for a rate cut but maybe not in the month of July. There are enough bright spots in this economy for the Fed to watch and wait.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He said the consumer spending is now running at a solid pace, but you're right, it's housing and manufacturing, those are the two weak spots and the uncertainty around trade. Markets have turned around, we're looking at a positive performance, let's get down to Gerri Willis. She's on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now with a reaction there, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Maria. That's right. So, these guys down here, they see this as a positive and you can tell by looking at the futures right this very minute. We were negative as much as 58 points in the break before the news came out, now we're up 15 points. Look, people down here don't expect the Federal Reserve Chairman to draw a line between today and what he's going to do on the 31st, but, boy, he almost did.</p><p>Remember at the last meeting he said an ounce of prevention is worth than a pound of cure, looks headed in that direction. Here's what traders were telling me this morning. One of the things they were interested in seeing him say is talking about the yield curve inversion and naturally trying to fix that, which would mean a rate cut, defending independence, and the idea, some guys down here re like it doesn't matter what he says, there could be an overreaction to anything he does and say.</p><p>But as you can see, the takeaway right now is ultimately positive, the markets are saying, you know, this seems to be a statement that the global economy is weakening, therefore more likely to do a rate cut. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thanks so much. Yes, I thought it was interesting that he starts his commentary by thanking the Congress, highlighting the independence of the Federal Reserve and thanking Congress for that independence. A lot here to go through, obviously these -- this has impacted markets and I want to turn to the battle at the border while also looking at the economy.</p><p>Apprehensions at the Southern Border are down 28 percent last month. According to the Department Homeland Security, the decline coming after the Mexican Government agreed to step up its own immigration enforcement in an effort to avoid heightened tariffs. Earlier in the program, I spoke with Vice President Mike Pence's Chief-of-Staff, Marc Short, about the decline in apprehensions. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARCH SHORT, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE'S CHIEF OF STAFF: We've had more assistance from Mexico in the last month than we've had from Congressional Democrats in 10 years in trying to secure our border. The 28 percent decline is really about attributed to Mexico. We have so many challenges on ours laws where one of the things that the Vice President and Secretary Pompeo helped negotiate last month with Mexico is a remain in Mexico policy. Many of your viewers may not know this, other than Mexican rule that says if you're not from Mexico, we can't return you back, we have to keep you here in the United States and go through the adjudication process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a really important point he made. Joining me right now is House Minority Whip, Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Morning. Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So before I get to those apprehensions, I got to get your take on the economy ahead of this Congressional interview with Jay Powell. We have his embargoed comments right now and while he says that the current expansion is in 11th year -- eleventh year. He also says that housing investment declined in the first quarter, decreased again in the second quarter, and manufacturing output declined in the first quarter, decreased again in the second quarter. How worried are you about these headwinds in the economy right now?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, you know, I think you're seeing two different things happen. Just last week, you saw over 240,000 new jobs created, so there are still good signs. I do think we need to get beyond these trade talks, wars, get rid of the tariffs, but ultimately get to better agreements for America.</p><p>It needs to start, Maria, as you know this, with USMCA. There's no reason why that bill hasn't come to the floor and passed already. Speaker Pelosi needs to schedule that for a vote. That'll help create more jobs and remove some of the uncertainty, and then let us all focus our attention on China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: Not just America, but all of our friends around the world want us to take on China, because they know we're the only ones who can. And if we do that, and if we get that resolved and get beyond trade issues that are hanging a cloud over our economy, I think the best is yet to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a really important point that you make. In fact, the Chairman of the Fed said that he sees these crosscurrents, first time he's used that word, crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about the global growth, that's been weighing on the economic activity and the outlook according to Powell, who will say this when he testifies to the Financial Services Committee coming up in a couple of hours here.</p><p>On the apprehensions, Congressman, what can you tell us? Has Mexico been a real mover in terms of getting those apprehensions down?</p><p>SCALISE: They truly have, and you heard Marc Short talk about it as well. I met with Secretary of Homeland Security a few days ago to talk about the crisis, what things he needs from Congress that Congress wasn't doing, finally starting to get them some relief. But he made the point to say that when Mexico finally engaged, President Trump had hung those tariffs over their head. They ultimately said, \"We will help with the crisis.\" They put thousands of their own agents at their Southern Border. And it's had over 20 percent drop in people coming across the Mexican southern border illegally.</p><p>We still have too high of a number coming over right now, and the big thing and even Mexican officials tells us this, Maria, it's the Broken Asylum Laws in America. Which are a magnet telling people to come here illegally, they know they can read from a script. Many of them, by the way, have turned downs asylum in Mexico.</p><p>So, how can you have a credible claim for asylum when you turned it down from another country you came through? Yet they're coming here in droves, in many cases 3,000 or 4,000 people a day illegally. They're abusing young kids in many cases by bringing them over, because they know that that's their ticket in. They get a -- they get a certificate literally to be here for at least five years before a court date. And what the secretary told me is over 75 percent of those people don't show up for the court date five years later, this is a broken system that needs to be fixed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: It takes Congressional action. You need to change the law. President Trump has identified that he wants to so solve -- we need to get it so quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was going to say. Isn't the onus on you and your colleagues? I mean you've to make the changes in the Congress in terms of the asylum standards.</p><p>SCALISE: Absolutely. And, look, the president's pushed the envelope as far as he can. He's done some things by executive action that had a positive impact. He's worked with Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: And got Mexico to help and engage, which has had a positive impact, but it's still -- when Jeh Johnson, the president -- the -- President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary is saying how bad it is today at the border, that tells you how bad it is, and yet Pelosi doesn't want to address the problem. She wants it as a political issue, so she won't bring any bill to the floor to solve this problem. But, look, I think people are fed up with this. They're looking at it, they're watching.</p><p>Every Democrat on the presidential stage, saying that they want free taxpayer benefits, free healthcare for people here illegally when seniors are paying more and waiting in longer lines, when people with preexisting conditions in many cases are paying a $10,000 deductible, and they want to give it away for me to people, illegally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: I think that people are watching this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they all read said when they say, you know - the question was do your -- does your governing include giving healthcare to illegals, they all said yes. They're -- they raised their hand.</p><p>SCALISE: Every one of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Marc Short said earlier on the program that he's expecting Nancy Pelosi to being the USMCA bill down for a vote in the fall. Is that what you're expecting or it is not happening this year?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, I think it's definitely possible that that happens. I'd like to see that happen. We will be willing to work. I've already got a whip team in place specifically for USMCA.</p><p>Kevin Brady, the head of the -- the Republican head of the Ways and Means Committee and I have already met with our teams. We'll be ready to help deliver the lion's share of the votes, but it's a big win for the whole country. It's not just a Republican win, Democrats win, the unions win.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: America is better off with USMCA than current law -- current NAFTA. We've got to get it done, let's create more jobs in our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And one of the issues with NAFTA was wages, you know, companies would put their production in Mexico and pay a fraction of what they had to pay in America.</p><p>Let me ask you about the minimum wage battle because that sort of dovetails on all of this. New data from the Congressional Budget Office says it examined the House Democrat's plan for a federal $15.00 minimum wage mandate, finding that a $15.00 an hour minimum wage would eliminate roughly 1.3 million jobs in the United States. Explain that to us, Congressman.</p><p>SCALISE: Yes, Maria. It even gets worse than that, but Speaker Pelosi wants to bring this bill to the floor, that would eviscerate millions of jobs. We've seen in that same CBO report as many as 3.7 million jobs in America would go away. That's the entire state of Oklahoma.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SCALISE: That's how massive their job loss would be. They don't address it at all, they're not concerned about that. They recognize it's a real problem for them. They might -- they might have trouble bringing that bill to the floor, because so many Democrats are afraid to vote for a bill that will eliminate millions of jobs. And in that same report, Maria, the CBO talks about how it will push millions more -- million -- millions more Americans below the poverty line.</p><p>So, they will literally create more families in poverty in America with that bill, and we've got wage growth growing right now without that bill, because there's a shortage of workers, as you know. With millions of openings for jobs -- good-paying jobs, with really good wages that are growing, why would they want to go and bring a bill that's going to not only destroy that job growth, but literally lead to the evisceration of 3.7 million jobs the entire state of Oklahoma?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible, 3.7 million jobs, that's obviously so much worse than about what we even thought. So, Congressman, what's your answer to the skeptics who say, \"Look, we still have an income and inequality problem\"?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, what I say is go look at what's happening right now in the economy. We're seeing the lowest unemployment amongst African Americans, amongst Hispanics in the history of our country. We're seeing wage growth go up, Maria, and it had been stagnant for over eight years. Under Obama for eight years, every single quarter, you have less than two percent growth.</p><p>Now we're finally seeing growth really high, we're seeing wages go up, let's get more of that, let's have more wage growth, not less. Why would you want to eliminate that? And look at this, Maria, in the last few years we've seen women-owned small businesses increase by 50 percent. Why would you want to bring policies that are going to destroy that, that are going to undermine that?</p><p>So, I think this shows the country the big divide between Republicans and Democrats in Washington. Most Democrats in America don't want to see their wages evaporate, they don't want some of the things that the Democrats are proposing like the Green New Deal, and Medicare for All, which eliminates the entire private health insurance market --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCALISE: -- with free insurance for people here illegally. And, again, shows you the big divide in Washington. There's a disconnect between Nancy Pelosi and middle America all across this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's also a disconnect between Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, so there's a disconnect within the -- within the party.</p><p>SCALISE: It's a shame to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Congressman, it's good to have you on the program. You mentioned small business and women, we just had one of them on the show. You're right, that's where you're seeing lots of job creation. We'll talk more about it. Congressman, thank you.</p><p>SCALISE: Let's keep that growth coming. Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve Scalise joining us there in D.C. Coming up, Team USA, the World Cup parades steps off today in New York City, celebrating the women's national team's big win. Stuart Varney weighs in next, then we will take you there live to check out all the action. But first, we've got a special update right now from The Tennis Channel.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger. Tuesday at Wimbledon saw the Women's Quarterfinals in action, and while former world number one moved on, Simona Halep, moved on and Elina Svitolina became the first Ukrainian woman to reach a grand slam semi- finals, the story was once again Serena Williams.</p><p>In her first match of the day, Serena defeated fellow American Alison Riske in a tightly contested three-set match. Serena even admitted this one wasn't easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER: No, I just needed to just fight. Alison was -- I mean she played so great throughout whole tournament, she's beaten so many amazing players that has been -- players that had great years and, you know, she was not giving it to me. I needed to step up and take it, and that's what I had to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER: But Serena's work was not done. She came back out to center court for mixed doubles with Andy Murray, this time winning in straight sets. Don't forget, you can catch coverage of the Men's Quarterfinals Wednesday on Tennis Channel at 4:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, partisan politics getting in the way of a great American win. Joining me right now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Big parade today, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, and I will be cheering them on, believe me. I think they're a great team, they prayed -- played brilliant soccer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they did.</p><p>VARNEY: They're the best in the world, case closed. I just hate to see politics intruding here. You know, I really don't like it when the captain of the American Team says, \"No, she's not going to White House,\" and then in an appearance on CNN last night, she -- he -- she basically tells the world, oh, she'd love to go and meet AOC and Speaker Pelosi, and she'd love to go and see Mr. Schumer, but, no, will not go to the White House because she detests President Trump.\"</p><p>I want to watch soccer. I want to see the greatest team in the world play soccer. I don't want to have in the back of my mind what's going on with politics here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: And, frankly, I think the Democrats have grabbed hold of the World Cup and are now running it as a sideshow to back up their policies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I don't like that at all. I'm sorry, I just don't like it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's very sad.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree with you. And, by the way, did the President invite them yet?</p><p>VARNEY: I don't believe he has yet specifically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, but she says she's not going anyway. OK. Well, there you go.</p><p>VARNEY: No, she's not going anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, I know you'll have more of this in 10 --</p><p>VARNEY: But what about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: I know, I just what about the rest of the team? Does she speak for everybody here?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point.</p><p>VARNEY: Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is a good point, because remember there was that other player who made sure that the flag wasn't stepped on. She picked up the flag, the American Flag, after Rapinoe just sort of like threw it aside.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes, yes. Yes. I -- it's divisive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: We should not be dividing at a time like this. You want to unite in support of a brilliant team.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>VARNEY: Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, I know that. You are right. Thank you so much.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll hear more in 10 minutes. Thank you. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right MORNINGS WITH MARIA, but first, we're going to take you live to the World Cup parade in New York City, check out the festivities, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hooray for Team USA, celebrating a big World Cup victory today in New York City with a ticker tape parade throughout Lower Manhattan. Kristina Partsinevelos is covering the story. She's down there in New York City. Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. What a perfect day for a parade. The sun is shining, we are just north of Battery Park. The parade will start 9:30 Eastern Time. We'll run up from Battery Park all the way to city hall along the Canyon of Heroes. According to the city, there's been about 206 parades along this pass, celebrating championships, victories, athletes, you name it, and right now, what you're seeing is the start of the parade. It starts at 9:30.</p><p>There are some motorcyclists over there, female motorcyclists, one of them drove by us and said she is starting with her story, they are making her story, so we do know a lot of people have been lined up according to the city as of Monday. People -- the public was able to get passes. Those were taken within seconds. A lot of people are excited. Another man told me he came all the way from Las Vegas to celebrate the fourth win, the World Cup win for the U.S. Women's National Team since 1991. It's called a ticker-tape parade.</p><p>A lot of our viewers probably know this, the ticker-tape often used back in the day for stocks. You print out some information on there. So, today, expect confetti absolutely everywhere. People can throw it on to the crowds, and we're going to be here bringing you all the information. Of course there's going to be a scrum very soon with the mayor perhaps. We will be discussing equal pay, perhaps we'll discussing just the situation, the political situation, but, overall, the people that I've met so far here are just as excited to celebrate their national U.S. Women's Team and we're going to bring you all the information as of 9:30 Eastern time. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Awesome. It looks great down there, Kristina. Thanks so much. We will be checking back with you throughout the day.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos in New York. Still ahead, futures are rebounding, now up in the triple digits on the Fed Chairman Jay Powell comments that we brought you 30 minutes ago. We got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back as the Dow is up now 111 points. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Thirty minutes away from the opening bell. Futures now up 100 points on Fed Chairman Jay Powell's prepared testimony. We brought you the embargoed comments earlier in the program at 8:30. Let's go through them to see really what's moving this market. Mitch, you have a -- you have a favorite in here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. In the last paragraph, it says Fed Chairman acknowledges that some FOMC members, \"Saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened,\" and I think that's one of the lines that the market's hanging their hat on, that. And if you look backwards, the FOMC members were sort of 50/50 on whether or not to cut so this may be perceived that it's tilted and it's more than just 50/50.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are reading this as we're going to get a cut.</p><p>BELL: Yes, I absolutely think that. What stuck out to me is he says government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, federal debt ceiling, and Brexit, meaning that fed cuts aren't necessarily going to save us from these policy issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's obviously listening to Dagen McDowell. You also pointed out earlier, Dagen, that it's housing and manufacturing of their weak spots right now that he's focused on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They continue to weaken in the second quarter. But, again, I don't get it. How does a quarter point or a half point cut by the Federal Reserve really rescue us from all of these problems, particularly the weakness overseas?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's trade, though. I like the fact that he brings in crosscurrents have emerged and that's the trade uncertainty.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's his robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or contrastive trade discussions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Patience. Patience.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But as a voter, sometimes crosscurrents push you in the right direction also.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It looks like it's pushing in the right direction today. Market's up 100 points. Have a great day, everybody. Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Lindsey Bell, great show, that'll do it for us. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.

Nydia M. Velazquez, D-New York, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez (D-NY) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) have written to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), encouraging the Council to consider designating the three leading cloud-based computing storage providers for the financial industry as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The letter follows last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation, which exposed the personal information of approximately 106 million Capital One credit card customers and applicants. The personal data of millions of Americans that Capital One was storing was being hosted in a cloud provided by Amazon Web Services, and was breached by a former Amazon employee. This recent incident raises new and serious questions about banks and financial companies' dependence on cloud services, profoundly worrying lawmakers about the data economy's risks to public safety and financial stability.</p><p>\"I was appalled to learn that millions of hard-working Americans' personal data had been compromised. Banks and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud service providers for their data storage needs increases the risk these systems pose to the safety and stability of our nation's financial system,\" said Velazquez. \"I am proud to partner with Rep. Porter to ensure the data integrity of our financial institutions is maintained.\"</p><p>\"Too often we are trying to solve yesterday's problems tomorrow, instead of making policy that prevents tomorrow's problems from happening in the first place,\" said Porter. \"As our financial system increasingly relies on cloud computing and other forms of technology, we need to ensure the proper 21st century safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis.\"</p><p>The letter calls on the FSOC to consider designating Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as SIFMUs under the Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. A SIFMU designation would subject the tech firms to enhanced oversight by the Federal Reserve to ensure a cloud failure of a leading financial institution would not create a catastrophic risk to the nation's financial system.</p><p>A .pdf of the letter is online here and the full text is below.</p><p>August 22, 2019</p><p>The Honorable Steven T. Mnuchin</p><p>Secretary</p><p>U.S. Department of the Treasury</p><p>1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.</p><p>Washington, D.C. 20220</p><p>Secretary Mnuchin:</p><p>We write to request that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC or the Council) convene a meeting and consider designating the three leading providers of cloud-based storage systems for the financial industry: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud--as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p>Last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) was the most recent in a string of incidences demonstrating the dangerous breadth of banks' and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud computing--and the reach of Amazon Web Services in particular. While it has been determined that an error by Capital One enabled the breach, the incident raises new and serious questions about banks' and financial institutions' dependence on cloud services for their data needs--and the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system.</p><p>Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to promote stability in the financial system, in part by granting the FSOC the ability to conduct enhanced oversight of Financial Market Utilities (FMUs). Per the Federal Reserve: \"In cases where, among other things, a failure or a disruption to the functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system, the FMU may be designated as systemically important.\" Title VIII authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to, among other powers, conduct examinations of, take enforcement action against, and prescribe risk management standards for entities designated as systemically important FMUs, or SIFMUs.[1]</p><p>According to the FSOC, it must consider the following four factors when analyzing the appropriateness of a SIFMU designation: \"(1) the aggregate monetary value of transactions processed by the FMU; (2) the aggregate exposure of the FMU to its counterparties; (3) the relationship, interdependencies, or other interactions of the FMU with other FMUs or payment, clearing, or settlement activities; and (4) the effect that the failure of or a disruption to the FMU would have on critical markets, financial institutions, or the broader financial system.\"[2] Though there are operational differences between cloud service providers and the eight existing SIFMUs, cloud services have become an essential element of our modern financial system and should be overseen commensurately.</p><p>First, though the cloud service providers at issue may not process monetary transactions directly, their operational stability underpins an increasing share of banks' central functions. For example, Bank of America Corporation intends to deliver 80 percent of its technological functions on virtual platforms and with public cloud infrastructure \"within the next several years.\"[3] According to its Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Azure \"continues to see strong cloud adoption from the financial services industry, with more than 80 percent of the world's largest banks and more than 75 percent of the global systemically important financial institutions using Azure.\"[4] HSBC's Chief Information Officer expressed similar sentiments at Google's 2017 Next conference: \"Apart from having the $2.4 trillion of assets on the balance sheet, we also have at the core of the company a massive asset in our data, and what's been happening in the last two to three years is a massive growth in the size of our data assets.\" HBSC uses Google Cloud; the volume of data held at the time of the conference was over 100 petabytes--or 100 million gigabytes.[5]</p><p>As data becomes increasingly monetized, hackers become more sophisticated, and firms put more data on servers or the cloud, these breaches are getting more severe. There have been over 9,000 data breaches made public since 2005, which have exposed over 11 billion records in the United States alone.[6] In 2005, 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts, held by DSW Shoe Warehouse, were breached--the first time a breach compromised over a million records. In 2017, the Equifax breach exposed the personally identifiable information of 148 million people.[7] First reported in July of this year, a data breach at Capital One, which relies on Amazon Web Services for its data storage, compromised over 100 million Capital One customer accounts and credit card applications.[8] Though cloud service providers may not process monetary transactions like other SIFMUs, these firms provide the world's biggest banks with the technological foundation necessary to link to one another and other financial and commercial market participants, thereby helping to enable monetary and commercial transactions while simultaneously maintaining their clientele's most sensitive information and associated assets.</p><p>With regard to the second factor, though there is no direct financial exposure if the cloud fails, the counterparty exposure in the form of a failure to provide the cloud service--and the operational losses that stem from that failure--could be significant.</p><p>Third, the volatility of public confidence in cloud services and the necessity of data integrity to maintaining that confidence is common to all cloud service providers. A data breach or other disruptive event that shakes public perception of the trustworthiness of the cloud could discourage consumers from using cloud-reliant banks and potentially spur a bank run. Should any cloud service provider fail, public mistrust of the service would not be limited to that one company. Particularly given the rapid speed of technological development, enforcing appropriate safeguards is critical to maintaining continued public acceptance of the cloud.</p><p>Fourth, the effect of a disruption to a cloud services provider on the broader financial system could be catastrophic. According to a 2016 report by McKinsey, 100 percent of financial institutions use cloud services in some capacity.[9] In addition to financial institutions, our government has come to rely on Amazon Web Services for a massive share of its data storage needs: the Department of Defense holds a $10 billion cloud computing contract with Amazon Web Services, and NASA and the state of Arizona are also clients of AWS.[10] An Amazon Web Services cloud failure in particular would debilitate major swaths of the financial industry, basic government functions, and our national security.</p><p>It is important to note that not all four factors are weighted equally. According to the FSOC in its 2011 Rule describing the criteria the Council would consider in designating SIFMUs, \"the two critical determinations for an FMU designation are: (1) Whether the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU now or in the future could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets (the ''First Determination''); and (2) Whether the spread of such liquidity or credit problems among financial institutions or markets could threaten the stability of the financial system of the United States (the ''Second Determination'').\"[11]</p><p>While not all banks have made public their cloud service providers, among major financial institutions, Capital One and Liberty Mutual use Amazon Web Services,[12] Bank of America uses Microsoft Azure,[13] and HSBC uses Google Cloud.[14] Fifty-seven percent of the cloud services market is cornered by those three providers: in the first quarter of this year, Amazon Web Services controlled 33 percent of the market, Microsoft Azure 16 percent, and Google Cloud 8 percent.[15] Given the technical nature of computing services, a firm like Bank of America would not be able to quickly transfer its cloud services to Amazon Web Services, should Microsoft Azure fail. In the interim, while the cloud was nonfunctional, the bank would be unable to perform up to 80 percent of its technological functions--potentially creating significant liquidity disruptions.[16] A lack of substitutability for the services provided by these very few firms creates systemic risk; a disruption at any major cloud computing platform would cause widespread and immediate harm and compromise the stability of the market.</p><p>Additionally, cloud services are not currently subject to an appropriate and enforced regulatory regime. In April, Federal Reserve examiners assessed an Amazon.com facility in Virginia,[17] using their limited power under the Bank Service Company Act to oversee nonbank vendors that provide the software to run banks' deposit and loan platforms.[18] \"Chaperoned by an Amazon employee, they were allowed to review certain documents on Amazon laptops, but not allowed to take anything with them.\"[19] The perfunctory review of a handful of Amazon-selected documents over the course of a few hours, on-site, is not meaningful oversight. Without a dedicated regulatory regime proportional and tailored to their very unique structure and risks, cloud computing companies will continue to evade supervision.</p><p>Our concerns are shared by the world's major financial market regulators. In February of this year, the Financial Stability Board--an international body comprised of the G-20's central banks and supervisors--noted that Big Tech is invading the financial sector and could upend the stability of the market.[20] In April, top European Union financial regulators issued a report in which they advocated for legislation to monitor cloud computing services that are central to financial institutions. The supervisors highlighted the vulnerabilities implicit in the financial industry's heavy reliance on third parties and noted that their concerns are \"especially acute with regard to cloud services.\"[21]</p><p>Given the serious and far-reaching risks inherent in our reliance on a handful of cloud service providers to maintain the basic functioning of our economy, we ask that you consider designating as SIFMUs the country's largest cloud service providers, including but not limited to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Please respond by September 15th with a description of the FSOC's plan to consider these designations. If the Council will not evaluate the appropriateness of using its authority under 12 U.S.C. Sec. 5463 to regulate cloud computing providers, please respond with your reasoning.</p><p>Signed,</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6831852 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6831852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWJ-V221-JC11-138W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2158\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Before I start with my statement, I want to let everyone know we have multiple hearings going on today and tomorrow we're having a hearing as well.</p><p>So you will see people coming and going, so especially for our witnesses, so you don't think that it's chaos, we have members trying to juggle a lot of things at the same time.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  This is chaos.</p><p>MURPHY:  It is chaos, OK.  I stand corrected.  We're meeting today to consider the deceptively complex question -- should the government have the ability to lawfully access encrypted technology and communications?  This is the question at the center of a heated public debate catalyzed earlier this year, when the FBI obtained a court order to compel Apple to assist in unlocking an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists.</p><p>But this isn't a new question.  Strong encryption has existed for decades.  For years, motivated individuals have had access to the tools necessary to conceal their activities from law enforcement, and for years, the government has repeatedly tried to limit the use of or obtain access to encrypted data.</p><p>The most notable example occurred in the 1990s; the development of encrypted communications equipment sparked fears that the government would lose its ability to conduct lawful surveillance.  In response, the NSA developed a new encryption chip called the Clipper Chip.</p><p>That would enable encrypted communications but would also provide the government with key to access those communications if necessary. This so-called back door sparked intense debate between the government and the technology community about the benefits and risks of government access to encrypted technology.</p><p>One of the principal arguments of the technology community was such a back door would create a vulnerability that could be exploited by actors outside of the government.  This concern was validated when a critical flaw was discovered in the Chip's design.  I should note that one of our witnesses today, Dr. Matt Blaze, identified that vulnerability which made the government's back door more akin to a front door.</p><p>As a partial solution, Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act called CALEA.  CALEA addressed the government's concern that rapidly evolving technologies were curtailing their ability to conduct lawful surveillance by requiring telecommunication providers to provide assistance in executing authority or authorized surveillance.</p><p>However, the law included notable caveats, which limited the government's response to encrypted technologies.  After the government relaxed export controls on encryption in 2000, the crypto wars entered a period of relative quiet.</p><p>So what has changed in recent years to renew the debate?  Part of the concern is, once again, the rapid expansion of technology.  At its core, however, this debate is about the widespread availability of encryption by default.</p><p>Well, encryption has existed for decades.  Until recently, was complex, cumbersome and hard to use.  It took effort and sophistication to employ its benefits either for good or evil.</p><p>But because of this, law enforcement was still able to gain access to the majority of the digital evidence they discovered in their investigations.  But now, the encryption of electronic data is the norm, it's the default.</p><p>This is a natural response to escalating concerns both from government and consumers about the security of digital information. The decision by companies like Apple and the messaging (ph) application WhatsApp to provide default encryption, means more than a billion people -- including some living in countries with repressive governments -- have the benefit of easy, reliable encryption.</p><p>At the same time, however, criminals and terrorists have the same access to secure means of communication and they know it and they will use it as their own mission control center.  That is the crux of the recent debate.</p><p>Access to secure technologies beyond the reach of law enforcement no longer requires coordination or sophistication, is available to anyone and to everyone.  At the same time, however, as more of our lives become dependent on the internet and information technologies, the availability of widespread encryption is critical to our personal economic and national security.</p><p>Therefore, while many of the arguments in the current debate may echo those of decades past, the circumstances of change and so too must the discussion.  We can no longer be a battle between two sides, a choice between black and white.      If we take that approach, the only outcome is that we all lose. This is a core issue of public safety and ethics and it requires a very thoughtful approach.  That is why we're here today to begin moving the conversation from Apple versus the FBI or right versus wrong, to construct a dialogue that recognizes this is a complex issue that affects everyone and therefore we are all in this together.</p><p>We have two very strong panels.  And I expect each will make strong arguments about the benefits of strong encryption and the challenges it presents for law enforcement.  I encourage my colleagues to embrace this opportunity to learn from the experts to better understand the multiple perspectives, layers and complexities of the issues. </p><p>MURPHY:  It is time to begin a new chapter in this battle, one of which I hope can ultimately bring some resolution to the war.  This process will not be easy, but if it does not happen now, we may reach a time when it is too late and success becomes impossible.  </p><p>So, for everyone on calling on Congress to address this issue, here we are.  I can only hope moving forward, you will be willing to join us at the table.</p><p>I now recognize the ranking member from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for five minutes. </p><p>DEGETTE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this important hearing.</p><p>Issues surrounding encryption, and particularly the disagreements between law enforcement and the tech community, gained significant public attention in the San Bernardino case, but I'm not particularly interested in re-litigating that dispute today.</p><p>As you said, Mr. Chairman, the conversation needs to be broader than just that one case.</p><p>Let me state unequivocally that I, like you, and I think the rest of us here today, recognize and appreciate the benefits of strong encryptions in today's digital world.  It keeps our communications secure, our critical infrastructure safe and our bank accounts from being drained.  It also provides each one of us with significant privacy protections.  But also like you, I see the flip side of the coin.</p><p>While encryption does provide these invaluable protections, it can also be used to obscure the communications and plots of criminals and terrorists, an increasingly great risk.  It's our task to help find the proper balance between those competing interests.  We need to ask both the industry and law enforcement some hard questions today.  </p><p>Last month, the president said, for example, quote, \"We want strong encryption, because part of us preventing terrorism or preventing people from disrupting the financial system is that hackers, state or non-state, can't get in there and mess around,\" end quote.  But if we make systems that are impenetrable or warrant proof, how do we stop criminals and terrorists?</p><p>If you can't crack these systems, President Obama said, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.       I've heard the tech community's concern that some of the policies being proposed, like creating a back door for law enforcement, will undermine the encryption that everybody needs to keep them safe.  And as they remind us, a back door for good guys ultimately becomes a front door for criminals.  The tech community has been particularly vocal about the negative consequences of proposals to address the encryption challenge.  </p><p>I think many of these arguments are valid, but I've only heard what we should not do, not what we should do, collectively, to address this challenge.</p><p>I think the discussion needs to include a dialogue about how to move forward.  I can't believe that this problem is intractable.  Now, the same thing seems to be true from where I sit for law enforcement, which raises legitimate concerns, but doesn't seem to be focused on workable solutions.  </p><p>I don't promote forcing industry to build back doors or other circumventions that experts will tell us will undermine security or privacy for all of us.  At the same time, I'm not comfortable with impenetrable warrant-proof spaces where criminals or terrorists can operate without any fear that law enforcement could discover their plots.</p><p>So, what I want to hear today is from both law enforcement and industry about possible solutions going forward.  For example, if we conclude that expansive warrant-proof spaces are not acceptable in society, then what are the policy options?  </p><p>What happens if -- if encryption is the reason law enforcement can't solve or prevent a crime?  If the holder or transmitter of the data or device can't or won't help law enforcement, what then?  What are suitable options?  </p><p>Last week, for the example, The Washington Post reported that the government relied on hat hackers to circumvent the San Bernardino iPhone.  Well, thank goodness?  I don't think so.  I don't think relying on a third party is a good model.</p><p>This recent San Bernardino case suggests that when the government needs to enhance its capabilities when it comes to exploring ways to work around the challenges posed by encryption.  I intend to ask both panels what additional resources and capabilities the government needs to keep pace with technology, while providing government with more tools or capability require additional discussions regarding due process, and the protection of civil liberties.  Enhancing the government's technical capability is one potential solution that does not mandate back doors.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Finally the public, the tech community, and the government are all in this together.  In that spirit, I really do want to thank our witnesses for coming today.  I hope -- I'm happy that we have people from law enforcement, academia and industry, and I'm really happy that Apple came to testify today.</p><p>Your voice is particularly important, because other players like Facebook and WhatsApp declined our invitation to be a part of this panel.  Now, the tech community has told Congress we need to solve this problem.  And we agree, but I've got to tell you, it's hard to solve a problem when the key players won't show up for the discussion.</p><p>And I'm here also to tell you as a longtime member of the subcommittee, relying on Congress to on its own, pass legislation in a very complex situation like this, is a blunt instrument at best.  I think it would be in everybody's best interest to come to the table and help us work on a solution.</p><p>Thanks again for holding this hearing.  I know we won't trivialize these concerns.  I look forward to work with everybody to come up with a reasonable solution.  I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Gentlewoman (ph) yields back.</p><p>I now recognize chairman of the full committee Mr. Upton for five minutes.</p><p>UPTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>For months now, we witnessed an intense and important debate between law enforcement and the technology community about encryption. While much of this recent debate is focused on the FBI and Apple, this issue is certainly much bigger than any one entity, device, application or piece of technology.</p><p>At its very core, this is a debate about what we as a society are willing to accept.  If you paid any attention to the debate, it might appear to be a black-and-white choice.  Either we side with law enforcement and grant them access to encrypted technologies, thus weakening the security and privacy of our digital infrastructure.</p><p>Or we can side with the technology community and prevent law enforcement from accessing encrypted technologies, thus creating a warrant less safe haven for terrorists, pedophiles and other evil and terrible actors.      It's important that we move beyond the us versus them mentality that's encompassed this discussion for far too long.  This debate is not about picking sides, it is about evaluating options.  It begins by acknowledging the equities on both sides.  From the technology perspective, there's no doubt that strong encryption is a benefit to our society.</p><p>As more of our daily lives become integrated with the digital universe, encryption is critical to the security and privacy of our personal and corporate secrets.  As evidenced by the breaches over the past year, data theft can have a devastating effect on our personal privacy, economic strength and national security.</p><p>In addition, encryption doesn't just enable terrorists and wrongdoers to do terrible things, it also provides a safe haven for decedents, victims of domestic violence and others who wish to remain hidden for noble purposes.  And as we look to the future and see that more and more aspects of our lives will become connected to the internet, including such things as our cars, medical devices and the electric grid, encryption will play an important role in minimizing the risk of physical harm or loss of life should these technologies be compromised.</p><p>From the law enforcement perspective, while strong encryption helps protect information and lives, it also presents a serious risk to public safety.  As a strong inaccessible encryption becomes the norm, law enforcement loses access to valuable tools and evidence necessary to stop bad actors from doing terrible things.</p><p>And as we will hear today, this cannot always be offset by alternative means, such as Metadata or other investigative tools. There are certain situations, such as identifying the victims of child exploitation, not just the perpetrators, where access to content is critical.</p><p>These are about a few of the many valid reasons on both sides of this debate, which leads us to the question, what's the answer, sitting here today?  I don't have the answer, nor do I expect that we'll find it during this hearing.</p><p>This is a complex issue and it's going to require a lot of difficult conversations, but that is not an excuse to put our head in the sane or resort to default positions.  We need to confront these issues head-on because they're not going to go away and they're only going to get more difficult as time continuing to tick.</p><p>Identifying a solution to this problem may involve tradeoffs and compromise on both sides, but ultimately it comes down to what society accepts as the appropriate balance between government access to encryption and security of encrypted technologies.</p><p>For that reason and others, many have called on us -- us, this committee, to confront the issues here.  That's why we're holding this hearing and that's why Chairman Goodlatte and I, along with Ranking Members Pallone and Conyers established a bipartisan joint committee working group to examine this very issue.      In order for Congress to successfully confront the issue, however, it will require patience, creativity, courage and more importantly, cooperation.  It's easy to call on Congress to take on an issue, but you better be prepared to answer the call when we do.</p><p>This issue is too important to have key players sitting on the sidelines and therefore I hope all of you are prepared to participate as we take to heart what we hear today and be part of the solution moving forward.</p><p>And I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Gentleman yields back (ph).</p><p>I now recognize Mr. Pallone, for five minutes.</p><p>PALLONE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I welcome the opportunity to hear today from both law enforcement and the tech community as we seek to understand and develop solutions to this encryption debate.</p><p>Encryption enables the privacy and security that we value but it also creates challenges for those seeking to protect us.  Law enforcement has a difficult job of keeping our nation safe and they're finding that some encrypted devices and programs are hampering their efforts to conduct thorough investigations.</p><p>Even when they obtain a warrant, they find themselves unable to access information protected by end-to-end encryption.  And this raises questions of how comfortable we are as a nation with these dark areas that cannot be reached by law enforcement.</p><p>At the same time, the tech community helps protect some of our most valuable information and the most secure way to do that is by using end-to-end encryption, meaning the divide or app manufacturer does not hold the key to that information.</p><p>When the tech community tells us that providing back doors will make their job of protecting our information that much more difficult, we should heed that warning and work towards a solution that will not solve one problem by creating many others.</p><p>It's clear that both sides in this discussion have compelling arguments, but simply repeating those arguments is not a sufficient response.  We need to work together to move forward and I hope today's hearing is just the beginning of that conversation.</p><p>In the last several months and years we have seen major players in this debate look to Congress for solutions.  In 2014, FBI Director Comey said, and I quote, \"I'm happy to work with Congress, with our partners in the private sector and with my law enforcement and national security counterparts and with the people we serve to find the right answer, to find the balance we need.\"</p><p>In an e-mail to Apple employees earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote about his support for Congress to bring together and I quote, \"experts on intelligence technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms,\" and he wrote that, \"Apple would gladly participate in such an effort.\"</p><p>So if we have any hope of moving this debate forward, we need all the parties to come to the table, the participation of our witnesses today should serve as a model to those who have been reluctant to participate in this discussion.  We can't move forward if each party remains in its corner, unwilling to compromise or propose solutions.</p><p>Both sides need to recognize that this is an effort to strike a balance between the security and privacy of personal data and public safety.  The public needs to feel confident that their information is secure, but at the same time we need to assure them that law enforcement has all the tools it needs to do their jobs effectively.</p><p>So Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield the remaining time to the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Clarke.</p><p>CLARKE:  I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding.</p><p>First, let me welcome Chief Thomas Galati, who is the Chief of Intelligence for my home town of New York City.  And many refer to the New York City Police Department as New York's finest, but I like to think of them as the world's finest.</p><p>Welcome, Chief Galati.</p><p>At its core, our Constitution is about the balance of power. It's about balancing power among the Federal Government, State Government and the rights of individuals.  Through the years, getting that balance just right has been challenging and at times tension- filled.  But we have done it.  We have prevailed.</p><p>The encryption versus privacy rights issue is simply another opportunity for us to, again, recalibrate and fine tune the balance in our democracy.  And as the old cliche states, democracy is not a spectator sport, so it's time for all of us to participate.</p><p>It's time to roll up our sleeves and work together to resolve this issue as an imperative, because it's not going away.  So I'm glad that we are having this hearing today, because I do believe that working together, we can find a way to balance our concerns and to address this issue of physical security with our right to private security.</p><p>So I look forward to hearing the perspective of our witnesses, the perspectives of our witnesses today and I yield back the remainder of my time.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you, (inaudible) yields back and thank you.</p><p>I would -- just to ask unanimous consent that the member's written opening statements be introduced into the record, without objection, the documents will be entered into the record.      Now I'd like to introduce the witnesses of our first panel for today's hearing.</p><p>MURPHY:  Our first witness on the panel is Ms. Amy Hess.  Ms. Hess is the Executive Assistant Director for Science and Technology, the Federal Bureau of Investigations in this role.  She's responsible for the Executive Oversight of the Criminal Justice Information Services Laboratory and Operational Technology divisions.  Ms. Hess has logged time in the field as an FBI special agent, as well as the bureau's headquarters here in Washington, D.C.  And we thank Ms. Hess for preparing her testimony and look forward to hearing your insights in these matters.</p><p>We also want to welcome Chief Thomas Galati, from the New York City Police Department.  Chief Galati is a 32-year veteran of the New York City Police Department, and currently serves as the chief of intelligence.</p><p>As chief of intelligence, he is responsible for the activities of the intelligence bureau, the western hemisphere's largest municipal law enforcement intelligence operation.</p><p>Thank you, Chief Galati, for your testimony today and we look forward to hear your comments.</p><p>And finally for the first panel, we welcome Captain Charles Cohen, of the Indiana State Police.  Currently he is the commander of the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Technologies, where he is responsible for the cyber crime, electronic surveillance and internet crimes against children.</p><p>We appreciate his time today and once again thank all the witnesses for being here.  Also want to note, Sheriff Ron Hickman of the Harris County Sheriff's Office will not be joining us today due to the tragic flooding yesterday in the Houston area.  Our prayers and thoughts are with the people of Houston.  We know there have been several tragedies there.  We all wish Sheriff Hickman could be with us but we understand travel logistics can sometimes make these things impossible.</p><p>I would ask unanimous consent, however, that Sheriff Hickman's testimony be entered into the record.  And without objection that his testimony will be entered into the record.</p><p>Now to our panelists.  As you are aware, the committee is holding investigative hearing and when doing so, has the practice of taking testimony under oath.  Do any of you have any objections to taking testimony under oath?      All say no.  The chairman advises you under the rules of the House and rules of the committee you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do any of you desire to be advised by counsel during the hearing today?  All say no as well.  In that case, would you raise your right hand, I'll swear you in.</p><p>Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p><p>Thank you.  You may be seated.</p><p>All the witnesses answered in the affirmative.  You are under oath and subject to the penalties of Title 18 Section 1001 of the United States Code.  You may now give a five-minute summary of your opening statement.</p><p>Ms. Hess you're recognized for five minutes.</p><p>HESS:  Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette...</p><p>MURPHY:  Just make sure your microphone is pulled as close to you as possible.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir -- and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and engage in this important discussion.  In recent years, we've seen new technologies transform our society most notably by enabling digital communications and facilitating e-commerce.  It's essential that we protect these communication, to promote free expression, secure commerce and trade, and safeguard sensitive information.  We support strong encryption.</p><p>But we have seen how criminals, including terrorists are using advances in technology to their advantage.  Encryption is not the only challenge we face in today's technological landscape, however.  We face significant obstacles in lawfully tracking suspects, because they can seamlessly communicate while changing from a known WiFi service, to a cellular connection to a WiFi hotspot.  They can move from one communication application to another and carry the same conversation or multiple conversations simultaneously.</p><p>Communication companies do not have standard data rate policies or guidelines, and without historical data, it's very difficult to put pieces of the investigative puzzle together.  Some foreign communication providers have millions of users in the United States, but no point of presence here, making it difficult, if not impossible to execute a lawful court order.  We encounter platforms that render suspects virtually anonymous on the internet and if we can not attribute communications and actions to a specific individual, critical leads and evidence may be lost.  The problem is exponentially increased when we face one or more of these challenges on top of one another.</p><p>Since our nation's inception we've had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  This means that only with probable cause and a court order can law enforcement listen to an individual's private conversation or enter their private spaces.</p><p>But when changes in technology hinder or prohibit our ability to use authorized investigative tools, and follow critical leads we may not be able to root out child predators hiding in the shadows or violent criminals targeting our neighborhoods.  We may not be able to identify and stop terrorists who are using today's communication platforms to plan and execute attacks in our country.</p><p>So we're in this quandary, trying to maximize security as we move into a world where increasingly information is beyond the reach of judicial authority and trying to maximize privacy, in the era of rapid technological advancement.</p><p>Finding the right balance is a complex endeavor and should not be left solely to corporations or to the FBI to solve.  It must be publicly debated and deliberated.  The American people should decide how we want to govern ourselves in today's world.</p><p>It's law enforcement's responsibility to inform the American people that the investigative tools we've successfully used in the past are increasingly becoming less effective.  The discussion so far has been highly charged at times because people are passionate about privacy and security but this is an essentially discussion which must include a productive, meaningful and rational dialogue, on how encryption as currently implemented poses significant barriers for law enforcement's ability to do its job.</p><p>As this the discussion continues, we're fully committed to working with industry, academia and other parties to develop the right solution.  We have an obligation to ensure everyone understands the public safety and national security risks that is result from the use of new technologies and encrypted platforms by malicious actors.</p><p>To be clear we're not asking to expand the government's surveillance authority, but rather to ensure we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that the Congress that is provided us to keep America safe.</p><p>There is not and will not be a one-size-fits-all solution to address the variety of challenges we face.  The FBI is pursuing multiple avenues to over come these challenges  but we realize we cannot overcome them on our own.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, we believe the issues posed by this growing problem are grave and extremely complex.  We must therefore continue the public discourse on how best to ensure that privacy and security can coexist and reinforce each other, and this hearing today is a vital part of that process.</p><p>Thank you again for your time and attention to this important matter.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you, Ms. Hess.  Now I recognize Chief Galati for five minutes.</p><p>GALATI:  Thank you.      MURPHY:  Make sure your microphone is on, and pull it as close to you as you can.</p><p>GALATI:  Thank you.</p><p>On behalf of Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton and myself, thanks to the committee for the opportunity to speak with you this morning.  Years ago criminals and their accomplices stored their information in closets, drawers, safes and glove boxes.  There was and continues to be an expectation of privacy in these areas, but the high burden imposed by the Fourth Amendment, which requires lawful search be warranted and authorized by a neutral judge has been deemed sufficient protection against unreasonable government search and seizure for the past 224 years.</p><p>But now it seems that that legal authority is struggling to catch up with the times.  Because today, nearly everyone lives their life on a smart phone, including criminals so evidence that once would be stored in a file cabinet or a notebook is now archived in an e-mail or a text message.  The same exact information that would solved a murder, catch a rapist, or prevent a mass shooting is now stored in that device.</p><p>But where law enforcement has legal access to the file cabinet, it is shut out of the phone, not because of the constraints built into the law, about you rather limits imposed by technology.  When law enforcement is unable to access evidence necessary to the investigation, prosecution and prevention of a crime despite the lawful right to do so, we call this going dark.</p><p>Every day we deal with this evidentiary dilemma on two fronts. First, is what is known as data at rest.  This is when the actual device, the computer, the tablet or the phone is in law enforcement's possession, but the information stored within it is inaccessible.</p><p>In just a six-month period from October 2015 through March of this year, New York City has been locked out of 67 Apple devices lawfully seized pursuant to the investigation of 44 violent crimes, in addition there are 35 non-Apple devices.  Of the Apple devices these incidents include 23 felonies, 10 homicides, two rapes and two police officers shot in the line of duty.</p><p>They include robberies, criminal weapons possession, criminal sex acts and felony assaults. In every case, we have the file cabinet, so to speak, and the legal authority to open it, but we lack the technical ability to do so because of the encryption protects its contents. But in every case these crimes deserve our protection, too.</p><p>The second type of going dark is an incident known as data in motion.  In these cases, law enforcement is legally permitted through a warrant or other judicial process to intercept and access a suspect's communication.  But the encryptions built into the applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Wickr and others thwart this type of lawful surveillance. So, we may know a criminal group is communicating, but we are unable to understand why.  In the past, a phone or a wiretap, again legally obtained from a judge, would alert the police officer to drop off locations, hideouts and target locations.  Now we are literally in the dark, and criminals know it, too.</p><p>We recently heard a defendant in a serious felony case make a call from Rikers Island where he extolled the Apple IOS 8 and the encryption software as a gift from God. This leaves the police, prosecutors and people were sworn to protect in a precarious position. What is even more alarming, is that the position is not dictated by our elected officials or our judiciary system or our laws.</p><p>Instead it has created and controlled by corporations like Apple and Google who have taken it upon themselves to decide who can access critical information in criminal investigations.</p><p>GALATI:  As a bureau chief in our nation's largest municipal police department, an agency that's charged with protecting 8.5 million residents and millions of (inaudible) computers and tourists everyday, I'm confident that corporate CEOs do not hold themselves to the same safety standards as our elected officials and law enforcement professionals.</p><p>So, how do we keep people safe?  The answer cannot be warrant- proof encryption, which creates a landscape of criminal information outside the reach of search warrants or a subpoena, and outside legal authority to establish over centuries of jurisprudence.  But this has not always been Apple's answer.</p><p>Until 19 months ago, they held the key that could override protections and open phones.  Apple used this master key to comply with court orders in kidnappings, murders and terrorism cases.  There was no documented incident or a code getting out to hackers or government.  If they were able to comply constitutionally, legally -- court orders, then why not now?</p><p>Ramifications to this fight extends far beyond San Bernardino, California, and the 14 people murdered there.  It is important to recognize that more than 90 percent of all criminal prosecutions in our country are handled at the state or local level.  These cases involve real people.  Families, your friends, your loved ones.  They deserve police departments that are able to do everything within the law to bring them to justice, and they deserve corporations to appreciate their ethical responsibilities.</p><p>I applaud you for holding this hearing today.  It is critical that we work together and across silos to fight crime and disorder, because criminals are not bound by jurisdictional boundaries or industry standards, but increasingly, they are aware of the safety net that the warrant-proof encryption provides them.  And we must all take responsibility for what that means.</p><p>For the New York City Police Department, it means investing more in people's lives than in quarterly earnings reports, and putting public safety back into the hands of the brave men and women who have sworn to defend it.</p><p>Thank you, and I will take any questions.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you very much, Chief.  Now, Captain Cohen, you are recognized for five minutes.  Again, pull the microphone close to you.      COHEN:  Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, thank you for allowing me to testify.  My name is Chuck Cohen, and I'm a captain with the Indiana State Police.  I also serve as Indiana internet crimes against children task force commander.</p><p>I would not be here for today if were not for encountering serious problems associated with encryption that do not have easy technological fixes.  We need your help, and it's increasingly apparent that that help must be legislative.  As far as I know, the FBI is not exaggerating or trying to mislead anyone when they say there's currently no way to recover data from newer iPhones.</p><p>Apple has intentionally designed an operating system and device combination that functionally acts as a locked container without a key.  The sensitivity of the personal information people keep stored in their phones should be compared with the sensitivity of information that people keep in bank deposit boxes and bedrooms.</p><p>Criminal investigators with proper legal authorization have the technical means to access both deposit boxes and bedrooms, but we lack the technical means to access newer cellular phones running default, hard encryption.</p><p>We are often asked, for example, of how encryption hinders law enforcement's ability to conduct criminal investigations.  There are numerous encrypted phones sitting in the Indiana State Police's evidence rooms waiting for a solution, legal or technical, to the problem.</p><p>Some of those phones belong to murder victims and child sex crimes victims.  Earlier this year, a mother and son were shot to death inside the home in Indiana.  Both victims had newer iPhones. I'm confident that if they were able, both would give consent for us to forensically examine their phones to help us find their killer or killers.</p><p>But unfortunately being deceased, they're unable to give consent and unfortunately for investigators working to solve their murders, they chose to buy phones running encrypted operating systems by default.</p><p>I need to emphasize that we are talking about not just suspects' phones, but also victims' phones, and not just about incriminating evidence, but also exculpatory evidence that cannot be recovered.  It is always difficult to know what evidence and contraband is not being recovered.</p><p>The child victims that are not being rescued, and the child sex offenders that are not being arrested as a result of encryption.  But the investigation, prosecution and federal conviction of Randall R. Fletcher (ph) helps to shed light on the type of evidence that is being concealed by encryption.</p><p>Fletcher lived in Northern Indiana.  During the course of an investigation for production and possession of child pornography, computer hard drives with encrypted partitions and encrypted thumb drive were seized.  The encryption was robust, such that it was not possible to forensically examine the encrypted data despite numerous attempts by several law enforcement agencies.</p><p>A federal judge compelled Fletcher to disclose the encryption key.  He then provided law enforcement with a passcode that opened the encrypted partitions, but not the encrypted thumb drive.</p><p>In the newly opened data, law enforcement found thousands of images and videos depicting minors being caused to engage in sexually explicit conduct.  To this day, investigators believe the thumb drive contains home-made pornography produced by Fletcher, but have no way of confirming or disproving that belief.</p><p>Fletcher had continuing and ongoing access to children, including a child he had previously photographed in lascivious poses.  Fletcher has previous convictions for conspiracy to commit murder and child sex offenses that are detailed in my written testimony.  There's good reason to believe  that because of hard encryption on the USB storage device, additional crimes committed by Fletcher cannot be investigated and prosecuted.</p><p>That means additional child victims cannot be provided victim services or access to the justice they so richly deserve.</p><p>I hope that Congress takes time to truly understand what is at stake with the going dark phenomenon, and what problems have been created.  There's a cost associated with an encryption scheme that allows unlawful access with some theoretically higher chance of lost data.  But there is a much greater and very real human cost that we already see across the country, because investigations that fail due to default hard encryption.</p><p>In my daily work, I feel the impact of law enforcement going dark.  For me, it is a strong feeling of frustration, because it makes the detectives and forensics examiners, for whom I am responsible, less effective.  But for crime victims and the families, it is altogether different.</p><p>It is infuriating, unfair, and incomprehensible why such critical information for solving crimes should be allowed to be completely out of reach.</p><p>I have heard some say that law enforcement can solve crimes using metadata alone.  That is simply not true.  That's like asking a detective to process a crime scene by only looking at the street address on the outside of the house where a crime was committed.</p><p>I strongly encourage committee members to contact your state investigative agency or local police department and ask about this challenge.  I greatly appreciate your invitation to share my perspective, and I am happy to answer questions today or at any point in the future.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.</p><p>MURPHY:  I thank the panel.  I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions.</p><p>Ms. Hess, I think sometimes the FBI's concerns about encryption are broadly characterized as being against encryption.  Considering the FBI's work on investigations like the Sony data breach, or recent (inaudible) attacks on hospitals, I have a tough time believing that your organization is against the technology that is so instrumental in protecting digital information.</p><p>So to clarify, does the FBI agree that strong encryption is important to the security and privacy of our citizens, or economic strength and our national security?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>MURPHY:  And also benefits law enforcement.  Yes, can you elaborate on that?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  Yes, and you are correct.  Is that, as I stated in my opening statement, we do support strong encryption, because it does all of the things you just said.</p><p>We also recognize that we have a continuing struggle and an increasing struggle to access readable information, to access content of communications caused by that encryption that is now in place by default.</p><p>MURPHY:  And so, it brings this question up then, are you witnessing an increase in individuals intentionally or even unintentionally evading the law through availability of default encryption?</p><p>HESS:  I think it's difficult to discern whether or not they're intentionally doing it.  However, we -- we are significantly seeing increases in the use and deployment of decryption, because it is a default setting now on most devices.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, related to that, then, Chief Galati, would you say that  default of encryption can create significant hurdles for law enforcement, is that the issue, as Ms. Hess was just saying, is it the default one?</p><p>GALATI:  Yes, sir.  The encryption, a lot of the apps that are being used today, even with legal process or, you know, coverage on the phone, you cannot intercept those conversations.</p><p>Often, we hear criminals, both criminals and also in the terrorism cases that we do, people encouraging participants to go to apps like Telegram, Whatsapp, Wickr and so on.</p><p>MURPHY:  You know, Captain Cohen, your testimony was very moving about those cases you described, people involved with murder and with victimizing children.</p><p>You know, this debate has oftentimes been about picking sides, the most notable being Apple v. the FBI.  So either you support law enforcement or you support the tech community.      That feels like a loser's proposition.  Look, I understand people want to be able to have encrypted technology, but based upon the responses, Chief that you -- Captain, that you heard from Ms. Hess and from the chief, do you think this is an us versus them debate?</p><p>Are there answers that we could be going for here?  What do you think?  Because you are on the front lines dealing with these terrible cases, that -- is this an us/them?  Is there an answer?</p><p>COHEN:  Mr. Chairman, I definitely do not think it's an us/them. What we do see, though, is a challenge with default encryption that functionally cannot be turned off.</p><p>I mean, I don't have the option to even disable that encryption. The difference is Mr. Fletcher, the example I gave you, was that after two prior convictions, he then learned that he needed to do something to protect himself better from criminal investigation, and then went out in search of, we assume, encryption and ways to do that.</p><p>The difference is now, what we are seeing increasingly -- to talk to your question to Ms. Hess as well, what we are seeing now is discussion among wide variety of criminals, and I see it daily, discussion among those that sexually solicit children online, sexually extort children, trade in child pornography, discussing the best possible systems to buy, the best combination of cell phone and operating system to buy, to prevent encryption.</p><p>COHEN:  Please make no mistake that criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it.  They're learning which messaging app to use to protect themselves against encryption.  They're also learning which messaging app is located outside the United States and has no bricks and mortar location here in the United States, which ones are located in countries with which we have a mutual, legal system (ph) and which ones we don't.</p><p>Criminals are using this as an education to make themselves more effective at the criminal trade craft.</p><p>MURPHY:  So given that, Ms. Hess, what answer will we have here, for those cases whether it's a terrorist planning a plot or they have already killed some people and we're trying to find out what the next move is?  Or it is a child predator?  Will there be an answer for this?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  And to clarify my earlier statement, too, we do see individuals, criminals, terrorists encouraging others to move to encrypted platforms, and we've seen that for some time.  And the solution to that, for us, is no investigator, no agent will take that as an answer to say that they should stop investigating.</p><p>They will try to find whatever workaround they possibly can, but those solutions may be time intensive.  They may not eventually be effective.  They may require an additional amount of resources or an additional amount of skill in order to get to those solutions.</p><p>But primarily, we are in -- usually -- a race against the clock, and that's the key component of how we're finding additional solutions around this problem.</p><p>MURPHY:  I know this is a frightening aspect for Americans, we understand privacy, but if there is some child predator hiding in the bushes by the playground, watching to snatch a victim, you can find them.  But now that this has given this cloak of invisibility, it's pretty frightening.  We better find an answer.  My time is up.</p><p>I now recognize Ms. DeGette, for five minutes.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Well, just a follow-up on the Chairman's questioning, the problem really isn't default encryption, because -- because -- if -- if you eliminated default encryption, criminals could still get encryption and they do.  Isn't that correct, Ms. Hess?      HESS:  Yes, that's correct.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Right, so the problem is that criminals can have easy access to encryption, so -- and I think we can stipulate that encryption is really great for people like me who have bank accounts who don't want them to be hacked, but it's just really a horrible challenge for all of us as a society not just law enforcement, when you have a child sex predator who's trying to encrypt or just as bad really, a terrorist.</p><p>So what I want to know is, what are we going to do about it?  And the industry says that if -- if Congress forces them to develop tools so that law enforcement with probable cause and a warrant can get access to that data, that then will just open the door.  Do you believe that's true, Ms. Hess?</p><p>HESS:  I believe that, there certainly will be always, no such thing as a hundred percent security.  However, industry leaders today have built systems that enable us to be able to get or receive readable content.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And Chief Galati, what's your view on that?</p><p>GALATI:  I believe that in order to provide -- and I don't want to call it a back door, but rather a front door, I think if the companies can provide law enforcement, I don't believe that it would be abused...</p><p>DEGETTE:  Why not?  Why not?</p><p>GALATI:  We have the CALEA Law from '94 and that was not abused, so I don't see how by making a law...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEGETTE:  What they're saying is the technology, once they developed that technology then, anybody could get access to it and they could break the encryption.</p><p>GALATI:  I believe that if we look at Apple, they had the technology going back to about 18, 19 months ago, where they were doing it for law enforcement, and I am not aware of any cases of abuse that came out when Apple did actually did have the key, so I can see if that they still have the key today, they hold it/</p><p>DEGETTE:  I'll ask them that,, because they're coming up.</p><p>Captain Cohen?</p><p>COHEN:  I think it might be helpful to look for real-world analogies.  If you think of an iPhone or an Android OS phone as a safety-deposit box, the key the bank holds, that's the private key encryption, the key the customer holds, that's the public key encryption.</p><p>But what the bank does is it builds fire walls around that. There's a difference between encryption and fire walls.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And you think that technology exists?</p><p>COHEN:  The technology does exist. So when we're...</p><p>DEGETTE:  I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of time but I'm going to ask them the same question.  Now, there's something else that can be done; forcing the industry to comply or like in the San Bernardino case, the FBI hired a third-party to help them break the code in that phone, and that was what we call gray hats.  People who are sort of in this murky market.  What do you think about that suggestion, Ms. Hess?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, ma'am.  That certainly is one potential solution, but that takes me back to the prior answer, which is that these solutions are case-by-case specific, they may not work in all instances. They're very dependent upon the fragility of the systems or as we might find.</p><p>And also, they're very time intensive and resource intensive, which may not be scalable to enable us to be successful in our investigation.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Do you think there's any ethical issue with using these third-party hackers to do this?</p><p>HESS:  I think that certainly there are vulnerabilities that we should review to make sure that we identify the risks and benefits of being able to exploit those vulnerabilities in a greater setting.</p><p>DEGETTE:  I understand you're doing it because you have to in certain cases.  Do you think it's a good policy to follow?</p><p>HESS:  I do not think that that should be the solution.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And one more question is, if third-party individuals can develop these techniques to get into these encrypted devices or programs, why can't we bring more capabilities in-house to the government to be able to do that?</p><p>HESS:  Certainly these types of solutions, and as I said this should not be the only solution, but these types of solutions that we do employ and can employ, they require a lot of highly skilled specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Can we develop those with the right resources?</p><p>HESS:  No, ma'am, I don't see that possible.  I think that we really need the cooperation of industry, we need the cooperation of academia, we need the cooperation of the private sector in order to come up with solutions.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  Gentlewoman's time's now expired (ph).</p><p>I now recognize the gentlelady from Indiana, Ms. Brooks, for five minutes.</p><p>BROOKS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>In 2001, after I was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern district of Indiana, I began work with the Indiana Crimes Against Children Task Force, which was led primarily by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve DeBrota, working hand-in-hand with you, Captain Cohen.</p><p>I want to thank you so much for being here.  Because prior to that time, I would say that I was certainly not aware about what really went into and what horrific crimes really were being perpetrated against children back at that time in 2001, 2002.</p><p>And when we talk about child exploitation against children, we need to realize this involves babies up to teenagers.  This is not all about just willing teenagers doing these times of -- being involved in these types of acts.  These are people preying on children of all ages.</p><p>And I want to walk you through, Captain Cohen, what some of the impediments are, a bit more about how this on works, how you are being thwarted in your investigations and also want to wrap up and make sure we have time for you to explain your thoughts about the fire walls.</p><p>First of all, if you could just please walk through with us, offenders -- and I'm talking about older children, now -- older kids who have access to social media.  Offenders, perpetrators are making connections through social media platforms, correct?</p><p>COHEN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>BROOKS:  And are those are typically unencrypted or encrypted?</p><p>COHEN:  Two years ago, I would've said typically unencrypted, now typically encrypted.</p><p>BROOKS:  OK and I left my service as U.S. attorney in '07, so things, I think, have changed pretty  dramatically.  Then, in the second step, the conversation moves to encrypted discussions, would that be correct?  They encourage particularly young people to go to apps like WhatsApp, Kik and others.</p><p>COHEN:  Correct, they'll generally go trolling for a potential victim in an unencrypted app.  Once they think they have a victim they think that they can perpetrate against, then they'll move to an encrypted communication app.</p><p>BROOKS:  And then, would it be fair to say that through the relationship that's been developed, they typically encourage them to send an image?</p><p>COHEN:  Correct, they want that victim to do one compromising act that they can then exploit.</p><p>BROOKS:  And that image is sent typically from one smart phone to another or from one smart phone to a computer?      COHEN:  Generally, from one smart phone to another, in the United Stated involving an Android phone or an iPhone.</p><p>BROOKS:  And then those -- but this doesn't just happen in our country, correct?</p><p>COHEN:  Correct, it's possible like never before for someone even in another country to victimize a child in the U.S.</p><p>BROOKS:  And in fact, so we have out-of-country perpetrators, as well as in-country perpetrators focusing on even out-of-country victims, as well.  Is that right?</p><p>COHEN:  Correct, ma'am, yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  And then are those typically encrypted?  The transmission of those photos are typically encrypted?</p><p>COHEN:  Yes, that's one of our challenges. The transmission is encrypted, as well as when the data sits at rest on the phones it's encrypted there as well.</p><p>BROOKS:  And you presenting that image to a jury if an individual is caught and needs -- and is prosecuted, it is imperative, is it not, for you to present the actual image to a jury?</p><p>COHEN:  Yes, ma'am. The metadata alone, who was talking with whom, doesn't matter. It's the content of the communication.  It's the images that were sent and received.</p><p>BROOKS:  So if you can't get these encrypted images and the encrypted discussions, what do you have in court?</p><p>COHEN:  We have nothing in court.  We can't complete the investigation.</p><p>BROOKS:  How do you find the victims?</p><p>COHEN:  Oftentimes we don't have way of identifying the victims. They go unserved.</p><p>BROOKS:  And can you please talk to us a bit more about why -- what it is that you actually do to find the victims.</p><p>COHEN:  We do everything we can.  We try to look for legal solutions, meaning trying to get records from (inaudible) service providers from the technology companies, trying to identify them through that.  The challenge we encounter there many times, as Ms. Hess mentioned, is because of retention periods, the records no longer exist, the metadata no longer exists. And then we try to get the content and the communication to show who was talking with whom and oftentimes we're unable to do that because of encryption.</p><p>BROOKS:  And isn't it pretty common that when you find one of these phones or a computer or a perpetrator, there are usually thousands of images involving multiple victims?</p><p>COHEN:  Thousands or hundreds of thousands. An increase (ph) (inaudible) find those also in encrypted cloud storage sites like Dropbox and Google Drive and One Drive.</p><p>BROOKS:  And could you please just expand a little bit on what was -- you previously started to answer -- potential solution with respect to fire walls.</p><p>COHEN:  A potential solution is to provide a better fire wall. Think of it as a vault door where the safety deposit box is. Think of that as the doors to the bank.  So while you think of the actual locks on the bank deposit boxes as the encryption, you build fire walls around that.</p><p>Those fire walls can, with legal process, be opened up. You can go inside it.  But just like a safety deposit box, if we go to the bank with a search warrant, the bank uses their key, we get a drill and we drill the customer's lock and we see what's inside the safety deposit box. I've done that dozens of times in the course of my career. The difference is with encryption, my drill doesn't break the lock.</p><p>BROOKS:  Thank you, I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  (inaudible) yields back.</p><p>Now I'll recognize Ms. Clarke for five minutes.</p><p>CLARKE:  I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our ranking member. </p><p>In October of 2014, FBI Director Comey gave these remarks on encryption before the Brookings Institute. \"We in the FBI will continue to throw every lawful tool we have at this problem. But it's costly.  It's inefficient and it takes time.  We need to fix this problem.  It is long past time.  We need assistance and cooperation from companies to comply with lawful court orders so that criminals around the world cannot seek safe haven for lawless conduct. We need to find common ground and we care about the same things.\"</p><p>So, Ms. Hess, I'd like to ask this question of you. Other than tech companies creating back doors for law enforcement, what do you believe are some possible solutions to address the impasse between law enforcement's need to lawfully gain access to critical information and the cybersecurity benefits of strong encryption?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, ma'am.  And as previously stated, I really believe that certain industry leaders have created secure systems that they are still yet able to comply with lawful orders.  They're still able to access the contents to either -- of those communications -- to either provide some protection for their customers against malicious software or some other types of articles. In addition to that, they're able to do it, perhaps, for business purposes or for banking regulations, for example.</p><p>In addition to those solutions, we certainly don't stop there. We look at any possible tools we might have in our tool box.  And that might include the things we previously discussed here today.  Whether that be individual solutions, metadata , whether it could be an increase in physical surveillance. But each of those things comes at a cost and all of those things are not as responsive as being able to get the information directly from the provider.</p><p>CLARKE:  So do you believe that there is some common ground?</p><p>HESS:  I do.</p><p>CLARKE:  To the other panelists, are there solutions that you can see that might solve this impasse?</p><p>The solution that we had in place previously in which Apple, as an example, did hold a key.  And as Chief Galati mentioned, that was never compromised.  So they could comply with the proper service of legal process. Essentially what happened in this instance is Apple solved a problem that does not exist.</p><p>GALATI:  I would say by Apple or other industries holding the key, it reduces at least the law enforcement having to go outside of those companies to find people that can get a solution.  So as mentioned earlier about the gray hat hackers, you know, they're going to be out there.  But if the companies are doing it, it reduces the risk, I believe.</p><p>CLARKE:  Very well.  In the San Bernardino case, press accounts indicate that the FBI has used the services of private sector third parties to work around the encryption of the iPhone in question.  This case raises important questions about whether we want law enforcement using non-governmental third party entities to circumvent security features developed by private companies.</p><p>So I have questions about whether this is a good model or whether a better model exists.  Mr. Hess, assuming press accounts are true and you procured the help of a third party to gain access to that iPhone, why were you apparently not able to solve this problem on your own?</p><p>HESS:  For one thing, as previously discussed, technology is changing very rapidly.  We live in such an advanced age of technology development.  And to keep up with that, we do require the services of specialized skills that we can only get through private industry.  And that partnership is critical to our success.</p><p>CLARKE:  So this is to the entire panel.  Do you believe that the U.S. government needs enhanced technological capabilities?</p><p>GALATI:  I think it does.  Private industry provides a lot of opportunities.  So I think the best people that are out there are working for private companies and not working for the government.</p><p>CLARKE:  Okay.</p><p>COHEN:  I agree with the chief.  Essentially we need the help of private industry, both the industry that makes the technology and others.  We need industry to act as good corporate citizens and help us because we can't do it alone.</p><p>There are over 18,000 police agencies in the United States.  And while the FBI may have some technical ability internally, those other agencies do not.  And as the chief mentioned, over 90 percent of all the investigations are handled at the state and local level.  We need industry's help.</p><p>CLARKE:  Very well.  I'll yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  (inaudible) yields back and now, recognize Mr. Griffith for five minutes.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  Thank you all for being here for this important discussion that we're having today.  I will tell you, we have to figure out what the balance is both from a security standpoint, but also to make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations under our Constitution, which was written with real-life circumstances in mind. Where they said we don't want the government being able to come in and get everything.  They were aware of the situation with general warrants, both in London, used against John Wilkes and the Wilkes (inaudible) rebellion and the Founding Fathers were also aware of James Otis and his fight in Massachusetts, which John Adams said sewed the seeds of the Revolution when the British government wanted to go from warehouse to warehouse looking for smuggled goods. So it's not an easy situation.</p><p>I do have this question, though.  Apparently some researchers recently published the results of a survey of over 600 encrypted products that are available online.  And basically they found that about two-thirds of them are foreign products.  So the question would be, given that so many of the encrypted products could, in fact, be from companies not located or headquartered within the United States of America.</p><p>If we force the companies that we do have jurisdiction over to weaken the security of their products, are we doing little more than hurting American industry and then sending the really bad actors like Mr. Fletcher, who is the child pornographer, just to a different format that we don't have control over?  That's one question that I would ask all three of you.</p><p>COHEN:  Right now, Google and Apple act as the gatekeepers for most of those encrypted apps.  Meaning if the app is not available on the app store for an iOS device, if the app was not available in Google Play for an Android OS device, a customer in the United States cannot install it.  So while some of the encrypted apps like Telegram are based outside the United States,  U.S. companies act as the gatekeepers as to whether those apps are accessible here in the United States to be used.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  All right.</p><p>Chief?</p><p>GALATI:  I would agree exactly what the captain said.</p><p>GALATI:  And, you know, certain apps are not available on all devices.  So if the companies that are outside the United States can't comply with the same rules and regulations of the -- the ones that are in the United States then they shouldn't be available on the app stores.</p><p>For example, you can't get every app on a BlackBerry you can on an Android or Google.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir, what you stated is correct.</p><p>I think that certainly we need to examine how other countries are viewing the same problem.  They have the same challenges as we speak and are having similar deliberations as to how their law enforcement might gain access to these communications as well.  As we move toward that, the question is what makes consumers want to buy American products? Is it because they're more secure or because they actually cover the types of services that the consumers desire?  Is it just because of personal preference?  At the same time, we need to make sure that we balance that security as well as the privacy that the consumers have come to expect.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  I appreciate that.</p><p>Captain Cohen, I am curious, you talked about the Fletcher case and indicated that the judge ordered he give the password to the computer but then you didn't get access to the thumb drive.  Was the judge asked to force him to do that as well?</p><p>COHEN:  The judge -- in that instance the judge compelled him to provide it.  He said, \"it was not encrypted,\" the thumb drive was not encrypted.  His defense expert disagreed and said, \"it was encrypted.\" He then provided a password and failed a stipulated polygraph as to whether he knew the password and failed to disclose it.  So every indication is he intentionally chose to not give the second password for that device.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  And was he held in contempt for that?</p><p>COHEN:  Not that -- I do not believe he was.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  All right.</p><p>I mean, look, obviously, if you can get the images you have better chance of finding the victim.  It's true though before encryption there was great difficulty in finding victims even if you found a store of photographs in a filing cabinet.  It was sometimes hard to track down the victims, isn't that correct?</p><p>COHEN:  It's always very difficult to find child victims.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  It is.  It's a shame.</p><p>I like the concept -- the visual of you're able to drill into the safety deposit box but you can't get into an encrypted telephone or computer.  Is there a product out there that would be that limited because one of the things I know Apple has had they don't want a back door to every single phone that other folks can get a hold of, or that the government could use at will, particularly governments maybe not as conscious of civil liberties as the United States.  Do you know of any such a product that would give you that specificity?</p><p>COHEN:  Again, the specificity would be similar to what we had prior to Apple changing where the encryption key is kept.</p><p>The legal process served on Apple as an example, and Apple is the one to use the drill, not law enforcement.  That helps provide another layer of protection against abuses by governments other than ours, meaning, while they have that capability because they're inside the fire wall, those outside the fire wall -- outside the vault would have no ability to get access.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  I appreciate it.  I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  The gentleman yields back.  I now recognize Mr. WELCH for five minutes.</p><p>WELCH:  Thank you very much.</p><p>First of all, I want to thank each of you for the work you and your departments do.  It's astonishing times when the kind of crimes that all America is exposed to are happening and the expectation on the part of the public is somehow some way you're going to make it right, you're going to make us safe.  So I think all of us really appreciate your work.</p><p>This issue as you've acknowledged is very difficult.  I think if any of us were in your position what we would want is access to any information that the Fourth Amendment allowed us to get in order for us to do our job.  But there's three issues that are really difficult. One is law enforcement issue that you've very clearly enunciated.  You have probable cause, you go through the process of getting a warrant. You're entitled to information that's on the phone or in the house, because of the technology we have impediments to you getting what you're legally authorized to get.  I think we want you to be able to get the information you rightfully can obtain.</p><p>The second issue that makes it unique almost is that in order for you to get the information, you have to get the active participation of an innocent third party who had nothing to do with the events but who potentially can get the information for you.  That's the whole Apple case.  But it's not -- very complicated situation because it's not as though if you came with a warrant to my house for me to turn over information I had.      It's one thing if I go in my drawer and give it to you, it's another thing if it's buried deep in the back yard and the order is I've got to buy a back hoe or rent a back hoe and go out there and start digging around until I find it.  Normally that would be the burden on the law enforcement agency.  So that's the second issue, how much can the government require a third party, a company or an individual to actually use their own resources to assist in getting access to the information?</p><p>And then the third issue that's really tough, as Mr. Griffith was just acknowledging.  we get a back door key, we trust you, but we have other governments our businesses are doing business with and they get pressured to provide the back door key, the key is lost and then things happen with respect to privacy and security that you don't want to happen and that we don't want to happen.  This is a genuinely tough situation where frankly I'm not sure there's a quote, \"easy balance\" on this.</p><p>So just a couple of questions.  Ms.  Hess, what do you see as the answer here if -- I know you want the information but if the getting of the information requires me to hire a few people to work in the yard with a back hoe or apple to really deploy high cost engineers to come up with a entry key?  Are you saying that's what should be required now?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir I think the best solution is for us to work cooperatively  with technology with industry, and with academia to try to come up with the best possible solution.  However, no investigative agency should forego that for all other solutions, they should continue to drive forward with all solutions available.</p><p>WELCH:  Chief, I'll ask you.</p><p>I mean, you are on the front line in New York all the time.  And is it your view that the right policy now would be for you when you have probable cause to protect us and, you know, we're all on the same page there, to force a technology company at significant effort and expense to assist in getting access to the information?</p><p>GALATI:  Sir, I would say up until a couple years ago, most of the technology companies, and they still do, have law enforcement liaisons we work closely with.  For example, if it's Facebook or Google or even Apple, where you know, we have the ability to go to them with legal process and they're providing us with the search warrant.</p><p>WELCH:  Right.  My understanding from talking to those folks is that if it's information like that's stored in the cloud -- this is a situation in San Bernardino.  There was a lot of stuff that was relatively easy to retrieve and they do provide that.  They do cooperate as long as you have the warrant, they do everything they can to accommodate those lawful requests from law enforcement.  Has that been your experience?</p><p>GALATI:  Yes, the cloud does have some issues because things can be deleted from the cloud and never recovered.  If the phone is not uploaded to the cloud, things are lost.  There's a very...</p><p>WELCH:  Would you just acknowledge there's a significant distinction between a company turning over information that's easily retrievable in the cloud comparable to me going to my house and opening a drawer and giving you the information you requested, versus a company that has to have engineers try to somehow crack the code so that they're very energetically involved in the process of decryption? That's the difference, you would agree?</p><p>GALATI:  Yes, it's a difference.</p><p>I believe when they create the operating system, that's where they have to make that key available.  So that they don't have to spend the resources to crack a code but rather have a new operating system that...</p><p>WELCH:  Thanks.  Just one last thing  -by the way, thank you -- I'm over?</p><p>All right, I just want to say I thought what Representative Clark said, \"about resources for you to let you do some of this work on your own,\" makes an awful lot of sense.  Some of these conflicts are going to be frankly as much as we want to say they're resolvable, they're hard to resolve.</p><p>I'm sorry, thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  I now recognize Mr. Mullin for five minutes.</p><p>MULLIN:  As you can see, I think both sides on this -- up here on this -- in this Committee you can see we want to get to the real problem.  We want to be helpful not a hindrance.  Obviously, all of us want to be safe but we want to make sure we operate within a constitution.</p><p>The technology is changing at such a pace that know law enforcement has to do their job and staying with it because criminals are doing their job, too.  Like it or not, and if it changes, crimes change, we have to change the way we operate.  The concern is privacy, obviously, and getting into that.</p><p>MULLIN:  Ms. Hess, some have argued that the expansion of connected devices through the internet of things provides law enforcement with new surveillance tools and capabilities.</p><p>Recently, the Berkman Center at Harvard University argues that the internet of things could potentially offset the government's inability to access encrypted technology for providing new paths for surveillance and monitoring.</p><p>My question is, what's your reaction to the idea that internet of things presents a potential alternative to access encrypted devices?</p><p>HESS:  Certainly, sir, I do think that the internet of things and associated metadata presents us with an additional opportunity to collect information and evidence that will be helpful to us in investigations.</p><p>However, those merely provide us with leads or clues, whereas the real contents of the communications is what we really seek in order to prove beyond all reasonable doubt in court in order to get a conviction.</p><p>MULLIN:  Could you expand a little bit on the content to what's in the device?</p><p>HESS:  The actual content of communication?</p><p>MULLIN:  Or the conversation that happens between the devices?</p><p>HESS:  What the people are saying to each other.  As opposed to just who is communicating or at what location they were communicating. It's critically important to law enforcement to know what they said in order to prove intent.</p><p>MULLIN:  Is there something that we on this panel need to be -- I say this panel, this committee, should be looking at to help you be able to gain access to that?  Or since it's connected, does it even take any extra steps for you to build to access that information?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, and exactly to the point of discussion here today, is that we need to work with industry and with academia in order to come up with solutions so that we can access that content or so they can access it and provide it to us.</p><p>MULLIN:  So is the FBI is exploring options I'm assuming?</p><p>HESS:  We are, yes, sir.</p><p>MULLIN:  Are there challenges or concerns using the growth of connected devices that you can see coming down the road, obviously, with the technology changing rapidly today?  What are some of the challenges that you're facing?</p><p>HESS:  Certainly as more and more things in today's world become connected.  There's also an increasing demand for encrypting those particular services, those particular devices and capabilities.  And that's well-warranted and well-merited.</p><p>But again, it presents a challenge for us as metadata is increasingly encrypted, that presents a challenge for us as well.  We need to be able to access the information, but more importantly, the content.  In other words, if a suspect's toaster is connected to their car so that they know it's going to come on at a certain time, that's helpful.  But it doesn't help us to know the content of the communication when it comes to developing plots.</p><p>MULLIN:  So is there a difference between say, the FBI the way you have to operate Captain Cohen and the way that you have to operate?</p><p>COHEN:  There's not much of a difference, because quite candidly, we work very well together.  But you ask the initial challenges.  In February Apple announces that it plans to tie the same encryption key to the iCloud account.  So, as an example, the content that's curling (ph) that cloud system iCloud, Apple's announced publicly, they plan to make that encrypted and inaccessible with the service of legal process.  So that's one of the challenges that you asked about, that we're looking at is, we're going to lose that area of content as well.</p><p>MULLIN:  So, I just assume that everything I do online for some intended purpose is out there.  And people are just going to go to retrieve it.  I don't assume any privacy when it's on the internet. Is that analogy -- could that analogy hold up true?  Or should we be expecting a sense of privacy when it's on the internet?  I mean, we put it out there.</p><p>COHEN:  Sir, I believe we should all expect a sense of privacy on the internet, a sense of privacy when we talk in a restaurant, when we talk on the telephone, landline or cellular.  But that privacy cannot be completely absolute.  We need to have, when we serve proper legal process, a search warrant.</p><p>As an example, to have the ability, the constitution protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures, not all search and seizures. So we have our private companies, without checks and balances protecting everyone against all searches.</p><p>MULLIN:  Chief, do you have an opinion on this?</p><p>GALATI:  Yes.  I agree also.  You know, on the internet, you have a right to privacy.  And most of these apps and programs give you privacy settings so nobody can get at it.  I think when you get into the criminal world or the malicious, criminal intent, that's when law enforcement has to have the ability to go in and see what you have on there.</p><p>MULLIN:  Thank you.  I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  Mr. Pallone is recognized for five minutes.</p><p>PALLONE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I never seem to be amazed at how complex an issue this is.  And it requires balancing various competing values and societal goals.  Yet, much of the debate is focused on simplified versions of the situation that paint it in black and white.</p><p>And there seems to be some misunderstanding that we have to either have cybersecurity or no protection online at all.  We've heard that the limitations that encryption places on law enforcement access to information puts us in danger of going dark.</p><p>By contrast, we hear the -- heard that the law enforcement now has access to more information than ever.  So-called golden age of surveillance.  At Harvard at the Burkman Center, there was a report titled, \"Don't Panic:  Making Progress on the Going Dark Debate\" that concludes, and I quote, \"The communications of the future will neither be eclipsed into darkness or illuminated without shadow.\"</p><p>And I think that's the useful framework to view the issue, not as a binary choice between total darkness or complete illumination, but rather a spectrum.  I think it's fair to say there have been -- there have been and always will be areas of darkness where criminals are able to conceal information.  And no matter what, law enforcement has a tough job.</p><p>But the question is how much darkness is too much.  So, I wanted to ask you all -- you know, this is for any of you, about some key questions on the spectrum if you will.  Where are we on this spectrum? Currently, where should we be on the spectrum?  If we're not in the right place, how do we get there.  Let me start with Ms. Hess.  And then, whoever else wants to say something.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  As far as the amount of information we can receive today, I think I -- yes, it is true we do receive more information today than we received in the past.  But I would draw the analogy to the fact that the haystack has gotten bigger but we're still looking for the same needle.</p><p>And the challenge for us is to figure out what's important and relevant to the investigation.  We're now we're presented with these volumes -- this volume of information.  And the problem, additionally with that, is that what we are collecting, what we are able to see is, for example, who is communicating with who.</p><p>Or potentially, what IP addresses are communicating with each other:  the location, the time, perhaps the duration.  But not the content of what they were actually saying.</p><p>PALLONE:  Chief, did you want to add to that?</p><p>GALATI:  I do agree that, you know, the internet has provided a lot more information to police.  That we can go out and we can find public records.  We can find, you know, records within police departments throughout the country.</p><p>So to police, the internet has made things a little bit easier. However, the encryption is taking all of those gains away.  And I think the more and more we go towards encryption, the harder it's going to be to really investigate and conduct long term cases.</p><p>We do a lot of cases in New York about gangs, drug gangs.  We call them crews.  And it's very vital, all the information that we get from people on the internet, that sometimes are very public out there. But now, they're switching to encrypted and it's making those long term cases -- or I guess call them similar to Rico cases, very, very difficult to put together because we're in the blind.</p><p>PALLONE:  All right.  Captain, did you want to...</p><p>COHEN:  I see that we have a lack of information that I've not seen before in my 20 years of investigations, to being able to do criminal investigations.  Not solely by encryption, but also it relates retention of information and the lack of legislation related to data retention within the internet service providers, similar to what there is to the banking industry, as well as our inability to service legal process on companies that are either located out of the United States or send and store data outside the United States.</p><p>I see it as all interrelated issues which together conspire to make it more difficult than ever before for me to gather the information I need to functionally conduct a criminal investigation. So on the spectrum you asked about.  I see it far to the extent of we're losing the ability to access information that we need to rescue victims and solve crimes.</p><p>PALLONE:  Thank you.  I think my second question, I think to some extent you already answered.  But if anybody wants to add to it.  The second question is, where do you see the trend moving?</p><p>Are we comfortable with where we're headed, or are the technology trends, such as increasing extraordinary encryption, leaving us with too much darkness?  But, you kind of answered that unless anyone wants to add to what they said.</p><p>Yes, Ms.  Hess?</p><p>HESS:  Yes sir.  I do see that with increasing -- increasingly, technology platforms continue to change and they continue to present challenges for us that I provided in my opening statement.  In addition to that, we try to figure out how we might be able to use what is available to us.  And we are constantly challenged by that as well.</p><p>For example, some companies may not know what exactly or how to provide the information we're seeking.  And it's not just a matter of needing that information to enable us to see the content, or enable us to see what people are saying to each other.      It's also a matter of being able to figure out who we should be focusing on more quickly so that if we can get that information, we're able to target our investigations more appropriately and be able to exonerate the innocent as well as identifying the guilty.</p><p>PALLONE:  Thank you.  I think I'm going to end with that.</p><p>But I just wanted to, you know, ask obviously, that you continue to engage with us to help us answer these questions.  I mean, not just, you know, with what you're saying today.  But, you know, a constant dialogue is what we need.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>I now recognize Dr. Burgess for five minutes.</p><p>BURGESS:  Thank you.  And thank you all for being here.  I acknowledge there's another hearing going on upstairs, so if some of us seem to be toggling back and forth, that's exactly what's happening.</p><p>Let me just ask you a couple of questions, if could.  There is another subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee called the Commerce Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee, and we're working very closely with the Federal Trade Commission, which is under our jurisdiction of (ph) that subcommittee on the issue of data breach notification and data security.</p><p>A component of that effort has been the push for companies to strengthen data security.  One of those ways, perhaps, could be through encryption, and the FTC will look at a company's security protocols for handling data when it reviews whether or not the company is fulfilling its obligations, protecting its customers.  So has the FBI had any discussions with the Federal Trade Commission over whether the back doors or access points might compromise the secured data?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  We have engaged in a number -- a number of conversations among the interagency with other agencies, with industry, with academia.  I can get back to you as far as whether we specifically met with the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>BURGESS:  That would be helpful, because again, we are actually trying to work through the concept of more in the retail space, but of data security.  Data security is data security, regardless of who is harmed in the process.  Data security is national security writ large. So that would be enormously helpful.</p><p>Let me just ask you a question that's probably a little bit off topic, but I can't help myself.  One of the dark sides from encryption is if someone comes in and encrypts your stuff you didn't want it encrypted, and then they won't give it back to you unless you fork over several thousand dollars in bitcoins to them in some dark market. So what is it that the committee needs to understand about that ransomware concept that's going on currently?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  Ransomware is an increasing problem that we're seeing and investigating on a regular basis now.  And I think that certainly, to exercise good cyber-security hygiene is important to be able to back up systems, to have the capability to access that information is important, to be able to talk to each other about what solutions might be available, to be able to fall back to some other type of backup solutions so that you aren't beholden to any particular ransom demands.</p><p>BURGESS:  And of course, that's critically important.  I'm a physician by background, some of the ransomware has of course occurred in hospitals, medical facilities, and I'll just offer an editorial comment, for what it's worth.  I just cannot imagine going into an ICU some morning and asking to see the data on my patient and being told it's been encrypted by an outside source and you can't have it, doctor.  When you catch those people, I think the appropriate punishment is shot at sunrise and I wouldn't put a lot of appeals between the action and the reaction.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  I recognize Mr. Yarmuth for five minutes.</p><p>Yazidi:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thanks to the witnesses for your testimony.  I find it hard to come up with any question that is going to elicit any new answers from you.  And I think that the -- your testimony and the discussion that we've had today is an indication of how difficult this situation is.</p><p>It sounds to me like there's a great business opportunity here somewhere, but probably you don't have the budgets to pay a business what they would need to be paid to get the information that you're after.  So that may be not such a good business opportunity after all.</p><p>I do want to ask one question of you, Ms. Hess.  In your budget request for fiscal year '17, you request more than $38 million to deal with the going dark issue.  And your request also says that it's non- personnel.  So it seems to me that personnel has to be a huge part of this -- this effort, so could you elaborate on what your request -- budget request involves and what you plan to do with that?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  At a higher level, essentially we're looking for any possible solutions, any possible tools we might be able to throw at the problem, all the different challenges that we encounter, and whether that's giving us the ability to be better password guessers or whether that's the ability to try to develop solutions where we might be able to perhaps exploit some type of vulnerability or maybe that's perhaps a tool where we might be able to make better use of metadata.  All of those things go into that request so that we can try to come up solutions to get around the problem we're currently discussing.      YARMUTH:  OK.  Well, I don't know enough to ask anything else. So unless anyone else is interested in my time, I will yield it back.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.</p><p>I now recognize Mr. McKinley for five minutes.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I've been here in Congress for five years, five and a half years now, and we've been talking about this for all five and a half years and I don't see much progress being made with it.  And I hear the frustration in some of your voices, but I was hoping we were going to hear today more specifics. If you could pass the magic wand, what would it be?  What's the solution?  I think you started to hinted towards it, but we didn't get close enough.</p><p>So one of the things I'd like to try and understand is how we differentiate between privacy and national security.  I don't feel that we've -- we've really come to grips with that.  I don't know how many people are on both sides of that aisle.  I really don't care. I'm very concerned about national security as it relates to encryption.  We've had -- just this past weekend, there was a very provocative TV show with \"60 Minutes\" came out about the hacking into cell phones.  We had -- about a year ago, we all were briefed, it wasn't classified.  It was the -- where Russia hacked in and shut down the electric grid in Ukraine.  The impact that could have that a foreign government could have access to it.</p><p>In just this past week at town hall meetings back in the district, twice people raised the issue about hacking and to shutting down the electric grid.  And I -- it reminded me of testimony that had been given to us about a year ago on the very subject when some -- one of the presenters like yourself said that it would -- within four days, a group of engineers in America or kids could shut down the grid from Boston down through -- where was it?  From Boston to New York could shut down in just four days.  I'm very concerned about that, that where we're going with this whole issue of encryption and protection.</p><p>So Mr. Galati, if I could ask you a question, just -- how confident are you that the adequacy of the encryption is protecting our infrastructure in your jurisdiction?</p><p>GALATI:  Well, Sir, cyber-security and infrastructure is very complicated and we have another whole section in the police department and in the city that monitors, works very closely with all the agencies, such as ConEd, DEP and so on.  We also work very closely with the FBI and that joint cyber task force to monitor...</p><p>MCKINLEY:  But my question really is how do you feel?  Because everyone comes in here, they're -- and when I've gone to the power companies, whether -- I don't need to list their names.  But all of them have said we think we've got it.  But yet, hearing that discussion on \"60 Minutes,\" this hacker that was there is a professional hacker, he said, \"I can break into any system.\"  Any system.  So my question again, back to you, is how confident are you that the system is going to work, that it's going to be protected?</p><p>GALATI:  Well, I think with all the agencies that are involved in trying to protect critical infrastructure, and I think that there is a big emphasize in New York, I'll speak about New York, working with multiple, multiple agencies, we're looking at vulnerabilities to the system.  I do think that is an encryption issue.  But again, I think what I was speaking about more when it came to encryption is more about communications and investigating crimes or terrorism-related offenses.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  Beyond your jurisdiction, then, on that...</p><p>GALATI:  That is not an area that I would comment.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  OK.  How about you in Indiana?</p><p>COHEN:  When you're talking about control systems being compromised, again we're talking about firewalls, not encryption. We're talking about the ability for someone to get inside the system, to have the password, to have the pass phrase, something like that to get the firewall.  So encryption of data in motion, as an example, would not protect us from the types of things you're talking about and being able to shut down a power grid.</p><p>COHEN:  It's noteworthy that I saw that \"60 Minutes\" piece, and what that particular hacker was able to exploit would not have been fixed by encryption.  That is a separate system related to how the cellular -- how our cell system works, essentially, completely separate, unrelated from the issue of encryption.  So what I can say is having more robust encryption would not fix either of those problems.  And I lack the background to be able to tell you specifically do I feel confident or not, confident about how the firewalls are right now in the systems you asked about.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  Ms. Hess?  Boiler up by the way.</p><p>HESS:  Yes.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  And so, my question back to you -- same to you.  How would you respond to this?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  I think that first off, I don't think there's any such thing as 100 percent secure.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  Right.</p><p>HESS:  Anything as a purely secure solution.  With that said, I think it is incumbent on all of us to build the most secure system as possible, but at the same time, representing to you today the challenge that law enforcement has to be able to get, or access or be provided with the information we seek, pursuant to a lawful order.</p><p>A warrant that has been signed by a judge to be able to get the information we seek in order to prove or to have evidence that a crime has occurred.</p><p>MCKINLEY:  Thank you.  I yield back my time.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  I now recognize Mr. Tonko for five minutes.</p><p>TONKO:  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  And thank you to our witnesses. I'm encouraged that here today, we're developing dialogue, which I think is critical for us to best understand the issue from a policy perspective.</p><p>And there's no denying that we're at risk with more and more threats to our national security, including cyber threats.  But there's also a strong desire to maintain individual rights and opportunity to store information, and understand and believe that it's protected.  And sometimes those two are very difficult.  There's a tender balance that needs to be struck.</p><p>And so I think, you know, first question to any of the three of you is, is there a better outcome in terms of training?  Do you believe that there's better dialogue, better communication, formalized training that would help the law enforcement community, if they network with these companies that develop the technology?</p><p>I'm concerned that we don't always have all of the information we require to do our end of the responsibility thing here.</p><p>Ms. Hess?  I...</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  I do think that, certainly, in today's world, we need people who have those specialized skills, who have the training, who have the tools and the resources available to them to be able to better address this challenge.</p><p>But with that said, there is still no one-size-fits-all solution to this.</p><p>TONKO:  Anything, Chief or Captain, that you'd like to add?</p><p>GALATI:  I would just say that we do work very closely with a lot of these companies like Google and we do, you know, share information. And also, you know, at times, work on training amongst the two -- the agency and the company.</p><p>So, there is cooperation there.  And I think that it could always get better.</p><p>TONKO:  And Ms. Hess in this encryption debate, what specifically would you suggest the FBI is asking for?  Asking of the tech community?</p><p>HESS:  That when we present an order signed by an independent, neutral judge, that they're able to comply with that order and provide us with the information we're seeking in readable form.</p><p>TONKO:  OK.  And Ms. Hess, is the FBI asking Apple and possibly other companies to create a back door that would then potentially weaken encryption?</p><p>HESS:  I don't believe the FBI or law enforcement in general should be in the position of dictating to companies what the solution is.  They have built those systems, they know their devices and their systems better, certainly, than we do, and how they might be able to build some type of the most secure systems available or the most secure devices available, yet still be able to comply with orders.</p><p>TONKO:  And do you believe that that type of assistance that you're requesting from tech companies would lead to any unintended consequences, such as a weakened order of encryption?</p><p>HESS:  I believe it's best for the tech companies to answer that question, because as they build these solutions to be able to answer these orders, they would know what those vulnerabilities are or potentially could be.</p><p>TONKO:  Thank you.  Another potential unintended consequence of U.S. law enforcement gaining special access may be the message that is sent to -- that they're sending to other nations.</p><p>Other countries that seek to stifle dissent or oppose their citizens may ask for tools as well.  Right now, even if other countries start to demand such a work around, Apple and other technology companies can legitimately argue they do not have it.</p><p>So, Ms. Hess, how would you respond to this argument that requiring tech companies to help subvert their own encryption establishes precedents that could endanger people around the world who rely on protected communications to shield them from despotic regimes?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  I would say, first, that in the international community -- and we've had a number of conversations with our partners nationally -- that this is a common problem among law enforcement throughout the world.</p><p>And so, as we continue to see this problem, obviously, there are international implications to any solutions that might be developed. But in addition to that, what we seek is through a lawful order with the system that we've set up in this country for the American judicial system to be able to go to a magistrate or a judge to get a warrant, to say that we believe -- we have probable cause to believe that someone or some entity is committing a crime.</p><p>I believe that if other countries had such a way of doing business, that that would probably be a good thing for all of us.</p><p>TONKO:  And Chief Galati or Captain Cohen, do you have anything to add by what was shared here by Ms. Hess?</p><p>COHEN:  In preparing for the testimony, I saw several news stories that said that Apple provided the source code for IOS China, as an example.  I don't know whether those stories are true or not.  I also tried to find an example of Apple answering the question under oath, and I did not find that.</p><p>I noted that Apple said they did not provide a back door to China, but did not talk about the source code.  The source code for the operating system would be the first thing that would be needed to hack into an iPhone, as an example.  And I know that they have not provided a source code to U.S. law enforcement.</p><p>TONKO:  Thank you.  Thank you.  My time is exhausted, so...</p><p>MURPHY:  (Inaudible) yield back.  Thank you.  Mr. Hudson, you're recognized for five minutes.</p><p>HUDSON:  Thank you, Chairman.  I'd like to thank the panel for being here today.  Thank you for what you do to keep us safe.</p><p>Ms. Hess, as more and more of our lives become part of the digital universe, everything from communications, to medical records, home security systems, the need for strong security becomes all that more important.</p><p>At the same time, however, it naturally suggests a massive increase in our digital footprint and the amount of information about the individuals that becomes available on the internet.</p><p>Does this present an opportunity for law enforcement to explore new, creative ways to conduct investigations?  I know we've talked a little bit about metadata, and why that may not be a good solution, but new forms of surveillance or other options that maybe we haven't discussed yet?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  I do believe that we should make every use of the tools that we've been authorized by Congress and the American people to use.  And if that pertains to metadata or other types of information we might be able to get from new technologies, then certainly, we should take advantage of that in order to accomplish our mission.</p><p>But at the same time, clearly, these things have presented challenges to us as well as previously articulated.</p><p>HUDSON:  Well, have you and others in law enforcement community engaged with the technology community or others to explore these other types of opportunities, or look at potential ways to do this going forward?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  We're in daily contact with the industry and with academia in order to try to come up with solutions -- in order to try to come up with ways that we might be able to get evidence in our investigations.</p><p>HUDSON:  And what have you learned from those conversations?</p><p>HESS:  Clearly, technology changes on a very, very rapid pace. And sometimes the providers or the people who build those technologies may not have built in or thought to build in a law enforcement solution, a solution so they can readily provide us with that information, even if they want to.</p><p>And in other cases, perhaps it's the way they do business, but they might not want to be able to readily provide that information, or they just may not be set up to do that, either because of resources or just because of the proprietary way that their systems are created.</p><p>HUDSON:  I see.  The other members of the panel, do you have any opinion on this?</p><p>GALATI:  I would just say that as technology advances, it does create a lot of new tools for law enforcement to complete investigations.</p><p>However, as those advances, as we start using them, we see them shrinking away.  You know, for -- with encryption especially blocking things that we recently were able to obtain.</p><p>HUDSON:  Got you.  You don't have to -- OK.  To all of you, I recently read about the CEO of MSAB, a technology company in the Detroit News article.  It said, \"There's a way for government to access data stored on our phones without building a back door to encryption.\"  His solution is to build a two-part decryption system where both the government and the manufacturer possess a unique decryption key, and that only with both keys, as well as the device in hand could you access the encrypted data on the device.</p><p>HUDSON:  I'm not an expert on decryption.  So, I must ask, is such a solution achievable?  And secondly, have there been any discussions between you all and the law enforcement community with the tech community -- or tech industry regarding a proposal like this or something similar that would allow safe access to the data without giving a key, so to speak, to -- to one entity?</p><p>COHEN:  To answer your question, that paradigm would work. That's very similar to the paradigm of the safety deposit box in a bank where you have two different keys.  And that would work, but it would require the cooperation of industry.</p><p>HUDSON:  Anything to add?</p><p>HESS (?):  That's (ph) what I was going to say.</p><p>HUDSON:  OK we'll get a chance to hear from industry on our next panel.  I was trying to explain this to my staffers and I said did you see the new Star Wars movie?  Well, you know the map to find Luke, BB- 2 had part of it -- or BB-8 and R2-D2 had the other half so you got to put them together.  Oh, I get it now.</p><p>Anyway, I think it is important that law enforcement and technology work together and continue to have these discussions.</p><p>I want to thank the Chairman for giving us this opportunity to do that.</p><p>I thank you all for being here and with that I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Gentleman yields back.</p><p>Recognize Vice Chair of the full committee, Ms.  Blackburn, for five minutes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And thank you to the witnesses, I am so appreciative of your time.  And I'm appreciative of the work product that our committee has put into this.</p><p>Mr. Welch and I with some of the members that are on the (inaudible) have served on a Privacy and Data Security Task Force for the committee.  Looking at how we construct legislation and looking at what we ought to do, when it comes to the issues of privacy and data security and going back to the law and the intent of the law.      I mean, Congress authorized wire taps in 1934.  And then in '67, you come along and there is the language; you've got Katz versus the U.S. that citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  And we know that for you in law enforcement, you come up upon that with this new technology, that sometimes it seems there is the fight between technology and law enforcement.</p><p>And the balance that is necessary between that reasonable expectation and looking at the ability of your ability to do your job. Which is to keep citizens safe.  So I thank you for the work that you are doing in this realm.  And considering all of that, I'd like to hear from each of you.</p><p>And Ms.  Hess, we'll start with you and just work down the panel. Do you think that at this point there's an adversarial relationship between the private sector and law enforcement?  And if you advise us, what should be our framework, and what should be the penalties that are put in place that will help you to get these criminals out of the virtual space?</p><p>And help our citizens know that their virtual you, their presence online, is going to be protected but that you are going to have the ability to help keep them safe?  Kind of a load of questions; we've got two minutes and 36 seconds so it's all yours and we will move down the line.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, ma'am.  As far as whether there's an adversarial relationship, my response is I hope not.  Certainly, from our perspective and the FBI, we want to work with industry.  We want to work with academia.  We do believe that we have the same values.</p><p>We share the same values in this country that we want our citizens to be protected.  We also very much value our privacy.  And we all do.  I think as you noted, for over 200 years, this country has balanced privacy and security.  These are not binary things.  It shouldn't be one or the other.</p><p>It should be both working cooperatively together and how do we do that?  I don't think that's for the FBI to decide nor do I think it's for tech companies to decide unilaterally.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, it will be for Congress to decide, we need your advice.</p><p>GALATI:  I think that it's not an adversarial relationship either.  I mean there are so many things that we have to work with. All the big tech companies, Twitter, Google, Facebook on threats that are coming in on a regular business.</p><p>They are very cooperative and we do work with them in certain areas.  This is a new area that we're going into but right now I would say it's not adversarial.  They're actually very cooperative.</p><p>COHEN:  I agree with the other two, that is not an adversarial relationship.  But ]as you mentioned, some of the statutes that authorize wire tap lawful interception, authorized a collection of evidence, they have not been updated recently.</p><p>And as technology at an exponential pace evolves, some of the statutes have not evolved to keep up with them and we just lack the technical ability at this point to properly execute the laws that Congress has passed because the technology has by-passed the law.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  OK and we would appreciate hearing from you, as we look at these updates.  The physical space statutes are there.  But we need that application to the virtual space.  And this is where it would be helpful to hear from you.</p><p>What is that framework?  What are those penalties?  What enables you to best enforce?  And so if you could just submit to us -- I'm running out of time but submit to us your thoughts on that.  It would be helpful and we would appreciate it.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Gentlelady (ph) yields back.</p><p>Now recognize Mr. Cramer, for five minutes.</p><p>CRAMER:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I thank all of you.  It's refreshing to participate in a hearing where the people asking the questions don't know the answer until you give it to us.  That's really cool.</p><p>I want to hone real specifically on the issue of breaking modern encryption by brute force, as we call it.  And that is the ability to apply multiple pass codes and perhaps an unlimited number of pass codes until you break it.  That's sort of the trick, here.</p><p>With the iPhone specifically, there's the issue of the data destruction feature.  Would removing the data destruction feature sort of be at least a partial solution to the -- to your side of the formula?</p><p>In other words, you know, we're not creating the back door, but we are removing one of the tools.  And I'm just open minded to it and looking for your out-loud thoughts on that issue.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir, if I may.  Certainly, that is one potential solution that we do use and we should continue to use.  To be able to guess the right password is something that we employ in a wide variety and number of investigations.  The problem and the challenge is that sometimes those pass code links may get longer and longer.</p><p>They may involve alphanumeric characters, they may present to us special challenges that it would take years, if ever, to actually solve that problem, regardless of what type of computing resources we might apply.</p><p>And so to that point, we ask our investigators to help us be better guessers in order to come up with information or intelligence to help us make a better guess.  But that's not always possible.      CRAMER:  But -- if I might, with -- you get ten tries and you're out data destruction feature that iPhone utilized.  That makes your job all the more difficult.  Would be expanding that from 10 to 20 or unlimited, is there some -- I'm not looking for magic formula.  It seems to me there could be some way to at least increase your chances.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir, and that's one of the things that does quite clearly present to us a challenge.  Is that usually it takes us more than ten guesses before we get the right answer, if at all.  In addition to that, many companies have implemented services or types of procedures so that there is a time delay between guesses.  So after five guesses, for example, you have to wait a minute or 15 minutes or a day in order to guess between those pass codes.</p><p>CRAMER:  Others?</p><p>COHEN:  I don't think, personally, that the brute force solution would provide a substantive solution to the problem.  As Ms.  Hess mentioned, oftentimes, that delay is built in.</p><p>IOS, as an example, went from a four digit pin to a six digit pin.  So what you're is increasing the number of guesses to guess it right.  So if you were to legislate that, it would not wipe the data and overwrite the data after a specific period of time.</p><p>You would have to write in that pass codes could only be of a certain complexity, a certain length and that would degrade security. What's important to understand is we want security, we want hard encryption but also need a way to quickly be able to access that data because of the investigations I work, oftentimes I'm running against the clock to try to identify a child victim.</p><p>And being able to brute force that, even a matter of days, yet alone weeks or months, that's not fast enough.</p><p>CRAMER:  Yes, well, thanks for your testimony and all that you do.  I yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Our tradition is to allow someone else outside the committee if you want to ask questions.</p><p>Mr. (inaudible), you're recognized for five minutes.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  I thank the chairman.</p><p>I thank witness for your service to our country.  I heard at least one of you state in your opening testimony that Congress is the correct forum to make decisions on data security.  And I agree with that.</p><p>However, encryption-related issues are technical.  They're complicated.  Most members of Congress aren't really experts in these areas.  Therefore, it's appropriate that Congress authorize a panel of experts from relevant fields to review the issues then advise the Congress.</p><p>The McCaul legislation does exactly that.  Do each of you agree with that approach -- the McCaul legislation?</p><p>HESS:  I believe we do need to work with industry and academia and all the relevant parties in order to come up with the right solution.  Yes, sir.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  So you do agree that that's the right approach, to convene a panel of experts on cybersecurity and privacy and so on?</p><p>HESS:  I believe that construct, we -- I -- there are varying aspects of that construct.  But yes, that premise I would agree with.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  OK.  Captain -- Chief?</p><p>GALATI:  Sir, I really couldn't comment because I haven't seen that bill.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  It basically...</p><p>GALATI:  I do agree with Ms. Hess that, you know, we need to work together.  I think we need to have, you know, a panel of experts that can advise and work with Congress.  I do believe that the answer is in Congress.  So I do agree with the principle of it.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  OK.  Thank you.</p><p>Captain?</p><p>COHEN:  Whatever paradigm helps members of Congress feel comfortable that they are properly balancing civil liberties and security, versus the ability for law enforcement to conduct investigations, whatever paradigm serves that purpose, I fully support.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  Thank you.  </p><p>Chief Galati and Captain Cohen, you've eliminated some of the information that has been available before in cell phones, but no longer is available because of encryption.  I thank you for doing that.  I was a little in the dark about that.</p><p>What haven't we heard, though, about information that is now available that wasn't available in the past because of technology?</p><p>COHEN:  Sir, I'm having problems thinking of an example of information that's available now that was not before.  From my perspective, thinking through investigations that we previously had information for, when you combine the encryption issue along with shorter -- shorter retention periods for service providers, keeping the records both metadata and data for shorter periods of time available to the legal process.  I'm having difficulty finding an example of an avenue that's available that was not before.</p><p>GALATI:  So, I would only say I've been in the police department for 32 years, so technology really has opened up a lot of avenues for law enforcement.  So I do think there's a lot of things that we are able to obtain today that we couldn't obtain 10 or 20 years ago.</p><p>So, technology has helped law enforcement.  However, the encryption issue, and I think the issue that we're speaking on today, is definitely eliminating a lot of those gains we've made.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>Ms. Hess, requiring backdoor or exceptional access would drive customers to overseas suppliers.  And if so, we would gain nothing by requiring backdoor or exceptional access.  Do you agree or disagree with that?</p><p>HESS:  I disagree in the sense that I think many countries are having this same conversation and the same discussion currently because law enforcement in those countries has the same countries that we do.  And so I think this will just continue to be a larger and larger issue. </p><p>So while it may temporarily drive certain people who may decide that it's too much of a risk to be able to do business here in this country, I don't think that that's the majority.  I think the majority of consumers actually want good products and those products are made here.</p><p>MCNERNEY:  Well, thank you for calling out the quality of American products.  I appreciate that, especially since my neighbor here and I represent the part of California where those products are developed.</p><p>But I think there's always going to be countries where products are available that would supersede whatever requirements we make. Also, requiring backdoor access would alert potential bad actors that there are weaknesses designed into our system and motivate them to try and find those weaknesses.  Do you agree with that or not?</p><p>HESS:  I don't believe there's anything such as a 100 percent secure system.  So I think there will always be people who are trying to find and exploit those vulnerabilities.  </p><p>MCNERNEY:  But if we design weaknesses into the system and everybody knows about it, they're going to be looking for those -- and those are design weaknesses.  I mean, I don't see how that could further security of critical infrastructure and so on.  So that's -- well, I guess my time is expired, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>The chair recognizes Congressman Bilirakis for five minutes.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate so very much.</p><p>Ms. Hess, thanks for participating in today's much-needed hearing.  Appreciate all -- the entire panel.  We are certainly at a crossroads of technology and the law, and having you and the FBI perspective is imperative, in my opinion.</p><p>I have a question about timing.  The recent debate has been revived as technology companies are using strong end-to-end encryption.  And you described the problem as growing.  </p><p>What will a hearing like this look like a year from now or two years from now?  What do you foresee is the next evolutionary step in the encryption debate so we can attempt to get ahead of it?  And as processors become faster, will the ability to encrypt keep increasing?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  My reaction to that is that if things don't change, then this hearing a year from now we would be sitting here giving you examples of how we are unable to solve cases or find predators or rescue victims in increasing numbers.  And that would be the challenge for us, is how can we keep that from happening and how might we be able to come up with solutions, working cooperatively together.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>Again, the next question is for the entire panel, please.  What have been some successful collaboration lessons between law enforcement and software or hardware manufacturers dealing with encryption?  And are there any building blocks or success stories we can build upon?  Or have the recent advancements in strong encryption made any previous success obsolete?</p><p>For the entire panel.  Who would like to go first?  Ms. Hess?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  I apologize, but could I ask you to -- I'm not 100 percent clear on that question.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  OK.  Let me repeat it, for the entire panel again.</p><p>What have been some successful collaboration lessons between law enforcement and software or hardware manufacturers dealing with encryption?  That's the first question.</p><p>Are there any building blocks or success stories we can build upon?  Or have the recent advancements in strong encryption made any previous success obsolete?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  Certainly, we deal with industry on a daily basis to try to come up with the most secure ways of being able to provide us with that information, and still be responsive to our requests and our orders.</p><p>I think that building on our successes from the past, clearly there are certain companies -- for example, as has already been stated here today, that fell under CALEA.  And those CALEA-covered providers have built ways to be able to respond to appropriate orders.  And that's provided us with a path so that they know when they build those systems what exactly we're looking for and how we need to receive that information.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Sir?</p><p>GALATI:  I'm sorry, sir, I really couldn't comment on that. That's not really an area of expertise of mine.</p><p>COHEN:  I concur with what Ms. Hess said.  There are a few technology companies that have worked with law enforcement to provide a legal solution, and they've done it voluntarily.  So we know the technological solution.  They provide a legal solution such that we can access data.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>COHEN:  And building on those collaborations, and having other industry members follow in that path would be of great help.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>Next question for the panel.  What percentage of all cases are jeopardized due to the suspect having an encrypted device, whether it is a cell phone, laptop, desktop or something else?  I recognize there are some cases, such as pornography, it may be 100 percent impossible to charge someone without decrypting their storage device.  But what about the other cases where physical evidence or other evidence might be available?  Does metadata fill in the gaps? </p><p>And for the entire panel; let's start with Ms. Hess, please.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, sir.  We are increasingly seeing the issue. Currently in just the first six months of this fiscal year, starting from last October, we're seeing in the FBI the number of cell phones that we have seized as evidence.  We're encountering passwords about 30 percent of the time.  And we have no capability around 13 percent of that time.  </p><p>So we've seen those numbers continue to increase and clearly that presents us with a challenge.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>GALATI:  Sir, just -- I'll give you some numbers.  We have approximately 102 devices that we couldn't get in, and these are 67 of them being Apple devices.  And if I just look at the 67 Apple devices, 10 of them are related to homicide, two to rapes, one to a criminal sex act, and two are related to two members of the police department that were shot.</p><p>So we are seeing an increase as we go forward of phones, not getting information on the phones.</p><p>One thing I will say, it doesn't always prevent us from making an arrest.  However, it doesn't present all the evidence available for the prosecution.</p><p>COHEN:  And to expand on what the Chief said, that can be exculpatory evidence we don't have access to.  The sad part is when our forensic examiners get called, we ask a series of questions of investigator, \"is there an iPhone, which model?\"  If we're told a it's a model for example,  5s or newer, 164 operating system, and it's encrypted, we don't even take that into evidence anymore because we know there's no technical solution.</p><p>So the problem is we never know what we don't know.  We don't know what evidence we're missing whether that is, again, on a suspect's phone or victim's phone where the victim is not capable of giving us that pass code.</p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you very much.</p><p>I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back the time.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we have one last question for the first panel. That's from the gentlelady from California, Ms. Eshoo.</p><p>ESHOO:  Thank you for extending that legislative courtesy to be here and join in on this hearing because I'm not a member of the subcommittee.  The rules of the committee allow us to, and I appreciate your courtesy.</p><p>I first want to go to Captain Cohen.  I first heard you say Apple disclosed its source code to the Chinese government.  I believe that you said that.  That's a huge allegation for NYPD to base on some news stories.  Can you confirm this?</p><p>COHEN:  Yes, ma'am.  I'm with Indiana State Police, not NYPD.</p><p>ESHOO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>COHEN:  What I said in my testimony, I have found several news stories but I was unable to find anything to either confirm or deny...</p><p>ESHOO:  Did you say that?  I didn't hear all of your presentation around that allegation.  But I think it's very important for the record that we set this straight.  That takes my breath away.  That's a huge allegation.  So thank you.</p><p>To Ms. Hess,  the San Bernardino case is really illustrative for many reasons.  One of the more striking aspects to me is the way in which FBI approached the issue to gaining access to that now infamous iPhone.  We know the FBI went to court to force a private company to create a system solely for the purpose for the government.  I think that's breathtaking.  It takes my breath away to try and digest that. And then, to use that information whenever and however it wishes.</p><p>Some disagree, some agree, but I think that this is a worthy and very, very important discussion.  Now, this came about after the government missed a key opportunity to back up and potentially recover information from the device by resetting the iCloud password in the days following the shooting.  The Congress has appropriated just shy of $9 billion, with a \"b,\" dollars for the FBI.  Now out of that $9 billion and how those dollars are spread across the agency, how is it that the FBI didn't know what to do?</p><p>HESS:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>ESHOO:  How can that be?</p><p>HESS:  If I may, in the aftermath of San Bernardino, we were looking for any way to identify whether or not...</p><p>ESHOO:  Did you ask Apple -- did you call Apple right away and say, we have this in our possession.  This is what we need to get. How do we do it, because we don't know how?</p><p>HESS:  We did have discussions with Apple.</p><p>ESHOO:  When?  After it was essentially destroyed because more than 10 attempts were made relative to the pass code?</p><p>HESS:  I'm not sure.  I'll have to take that as a question for the record.</p><p>ESHOO:  I'd like to know, Ms. Hess, your response to this.</p><p>I served for almost a decade on the House Intelligence Committee. During my tenure, Michael Hayden was the CIA director.  Now he's the former director of CIA, he has said, \"America is safer with unbreakable end to end encryption.\"  Tell me what your response is to that.</p><p>HESS:  My response...      ESHOO:  I think cyber crime, I might add, excuse me, is embedded in this whole issue but I'd like to hear your response to the former director of the CIA.</p><p>HESS:  Yes, ma'am.  From what I have read and heard from what he has said, he certainly, I believe, emphasizes and captures what was occurring at the time that he was in charge of those agencies.</p><p>ESHOO:  Has his thinking stopped from the time he was CIA director to being former, and he doesn't understand encryption any longer?  What are you suggesting?</p><p>HESS:  No ma'am, technology proceeds at such a rapid pace, one must be constantly in that business in order to keep up with the iterations.</p><p>ESHOO:  Let me ask you about this.  Once criminals know that American encryption products are open to government surveillance, what's going to stop them from using encrypted products and applications that fall outside of the jurisdiction of American law enforcement?  I've heard you repeat over and over again, \"we're talking to people in Europe, we're talking.\"  I don't know, is there a body that you're working through?  Has this been formalized?  Because if this stops at our border but doesn't include others, this is a big problem for the United States of America, law enforcement, and American products.</p><p>MURPHY:  The gentlelady's time has expired.</p><p>ESHOO:  Can she respond?</p><p>HESS:  Yes ma'am, we are working with international committee, our international partners on that...</p><p>ESHOO:  How?  Is there some kind of international body you're working through?</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>ESHOO:  Can she answer that?</p><p>MURPHY:  Do you want to finish your remark?</p><p>HESS:  There's no one specific organization that we work through. There are a number of organizations we work through to that extent.</p><p>ESHOO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, I'd ask unanimous consent all of the members of the Committee, as well as the members of the full Committee who have been asked to sit in be allowed to supplement their verbal answers with written answers of the witnesses.</p><p>MURPHY:  Approved.</p><p>Without any members seeking to be recognized for questions I'd like to thank the witnesses for their testimony today.  Now I'd like to call the witnesses for our second panel to the table.  Thank you again.</p><p>MURPHY:  OK.  Start the second panel, I'd like to introduce the witnesses of our second panel for today's hearing, starting with Mr. Bruce Sewell will lead off the second panel.  Mr. Sewell is Apple's General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Legal and Global Security.  He serves on the company's executive board and overseas all legal matters including corporate governance, global security and privacy.</p><p>We thank Mr. Sewell for being with us today and look forward to his comments.</p><p>We'd also like to welcome Amit Yoran -- is that close enough? Thank you -- Mr. Yoran, the president of RSA security.  RSA is an American computer and network security company, and as president, Mr. Yoran is responsible for developing RSA's strategic vision and operational execution across the business.</p><p>Thanks to Mr. Yoran for appearing before us today, and we appreciate his testimony.</p><p>Next, we welcome Dr. Matthew Blaze, associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Blaze is a researcher in the area of secure systems, cryptology and trust management.  He has been at the forefront of these issues for over a decade and we appreciate his being here today and offering his testimony on this very important issue.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to introduce Dr. Daniel Weitzner, who is director and principle research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Decentralized Information Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Mr. Weitzner previously served as the United States deputy chief technological officer for internet policy in the White House.  We thank him for being with us today, and look forward to learning from his expertise.</p><p>I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here and look forward to the discussion.</p><p>Now, as we begin, you are aware this committee is holding an investigative hearing, and when doing so, has had the practice of taking testimony under oath.</p><p>Do any of you have objection to testifying under oath?      OK, seeing none, the chair then advises you that under the rules of the House and rules of the committee, you're entitled to be advised by counsel.</p><p>Do any of you desire to be represented or advised by counsel during your testimony today?</p><p>Seeing none.  In that case, if you would please rise and raise your right-hand, I will swear you in.</p><p>Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?  Thank you.  You're now under oath and subject to the penalties set forth in Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code.</p><p>You now have a five-minute summary -- each of you may be able to give a five-minute summary of your written statement, starting with Mr. Sewell.</p><p>SEWELL:  (Inaudible).  Better?  Great.</p><p>Thank you Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette and members of the subcommittee.  It's my pleasure to appear before you today on behalf of Apple.  We appreciate your invitation and the opportunity to be part of this important discussion on encryption.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of people trust Apple products with the most intimate details of their daily lives.  Some of you may have a smart phone in your pocket right now.  And if you think about it, there's probably more information stored on that phone than a thief could get by breaking into your home.</p><p>And it's not a phone -- it's a photo album, it's a wallet, it's how you communicate with your doctor, your partner and your kids. It's also the command central for your car and your home.</p><p>Many people also use their smart phone to authenticate and to gain access into other networks, businesses, financial systems and critical infrastructure.  And we feel a great sense of responsibility to protect that information and that access.</p><p>For all of these reasons, our digital devices, indeed, our entire digital lives are increasingly and persistently under siege from attackers, and their attacks grow more sophisticated every day.  This quest for access fuels a multi-billion dollar covert world of thieves, hackers and crooks.</p><p>We're all aware of some of the recent large scale attacks. Hundreds of thousands of social security numbers were stolen from the IRS.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has said as many as 21 million records were compromised and as many as 78 million people were affected by an attack on Anthem's health insurance records.</p><p>The best way that we and the technology industry know how to protect your information is through the use of strong encryption. Strong encryption is a good thing.  It is a necessary thing.</p><p>And the government agrees.  Encryption today is the backbone of our cyber security infrastructure, and provides the very best defense we have against increasingly hostile attacks.  The United States has spent tens of millions of dollars through the Open Technology Fund and other programs to fund strong encryption.</p><p>And the administration's review group on intelligence and communications technology urged the U.S. Government to fully support, and not in any way to subvert, undermine or weaken generally available commercial encryption software.</p><p>At Apple, with every release of hardware and software, we advance the safety, security and data protection features in our products.  We work hard also to assist law enforcement, because we share their goal of creating a safer world.</p><p>I manage a team of dedicated professionals that are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Not a day goes by where someone on my team is not working with law enforcement.</p><p>We know from our interaction with law enforcement officials that the information we're providing is extremely useful in helping to prevent and solve crimes.  Keep in mind, that the people subject to law enforcement inquiries represent far less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>But all of those users, 100 percent of them, would be made more vulnerable if we were forced to build a back door.</p><p>As you've heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information from them.  But technologists and national security experts don't see the world that way.  We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information, information that law enforcement can use to solve and prevent crimes. This difference in perspective, this is where we should be focused.</p><p>To suggest that the American people must choose between privacy and security is to present a false choice.  The issue is not about privacy at the expense of security, it's about maximizing safety and security.</p><p>We feel strongly Americans will be better off if we can offer the very best protections for their digital lives.</p><p>Mr. Chairman, that's where I was going to conclude my comments, but I think I owe it to this committee to add one additional thought. And I want to be very clear on this.</p><p>We have not provided source code to the Chinese government.  We did not have a key 19 months ago that we threw away.  We have not announced that we're going to apply pass code encryption to the next generation iCloud.</p><p>I just want to be very clear on that, because we heard three allegations.  Those allegations have no merit.      Thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  And we turn now to the second panelist, Mr. Yoran.</p><p>YORAN:   Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on encryption.</p><p>This is a very complex and nuanced issue, and I applaud the committee's efforts to better understand all aspects of this debate. My name is Amit Yoran, and I am the president of RSA, the security division of EMC.</p><p>I'd like to thank my mom for coming to hear my testimony today. In case things go sideways, I assure you she's much tougher than she looks.</p><p>I've spent over 20 years in the cyber security field.  In my current role, I strive to ensure that RSA provides industry leading cyber security solutions.</p><p>RSA has been a cyber security industry leader for more than 30 years.  The more than 30,000 global customers we serve represent every sector of our economy.  Fundamental to RSA's understanding of the issues at hand, is our rich heritage in encryption; it is a basis for cyber security technology.</p><p>Our cyber security products are found in government agencies, banks, utilities, retailers, as well as hospitals and schools.  At our core, we at RSA believe in the power of digital technology to fundamentally transform business and society for the better, and that the pervasiveness of our technology helps to protect everyone.</p><p>Let me take a moment to say that we deeply appreciate the work of law enforcement and the national security community to protect our nation.  I commend the men and women of law enforcement who have dedicated their lives to serving justice.  Private industry has long partnered with law enforcement agencies to advance and protect our nation and the rule of law.</p><p>Where lawful court orders mandate it, or where moral alignment encourages it, many tech companies have a regular, ongoing and cooperative relationship with law enforcement in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>Simply put, it is in all of our best interests for the laws to be enforced.</p><p>I have four points I'd like to present today, all of which I've extrapolated on in my written testimony.</p><p>First, this is no place for extreme positions or rush decisions. The line connecting privacy and security is as delicate to national security as it is to our prosperity as a nation.</p><p>I encourage you to continue to evaluate the issue and not rush to a solution.</p><p>Second, law enforcement has access to a lot of valuable information they need to do their job.  I would encourage you to ensure that the FBI and law enforcement agencies have the resources and are prioritizing the tools and technical expertise required to keep up with the evolution of technology, and meet their important mission.</p><p>YORAN:  Third, strong encryption is foundational to good cyber security.  If we lower the bar there, we expose ourselves further to those that would do us harm.</p><p>As you know, recent and heinous terrorist attacks have reinvigorated calls for exceptional access mechanisms.  This is a call to create back door to allow law enforcement access to all encrypted information.  Exceptional access increases complexity and introduces new vulnerabilities.  It undermines integrity of internet infrastructure and introduces more risk, not less, to our national interests.</p><p>Creating a back door to encryption means creating opportunity for more people with nefarious intentions to harm us.  Sophisticated adversaries and criminals would not knowingly use methods they know law enforcement could access, particularly when foreign encryption is readily available.  Therefore, any perceived gains to our security from exceptional access are greatly overestimated.  </p><p>Fourth, this is a basic principle of economics with very serious consequences.  Our standard of living depends on the goods and services we can produce.  If we require exceptional access from U.S. based companies that would make our information economy less secure, the market will go else where.  But worse than that, it would weaken our power, and utilities, our infrastructures, manufacturing, health care, defense, and financial systems.</p><p>Weakening encryption would significantly weaken our nation. Simply put, exceptional access does more harm than good.  This is the seemingly unanimous opinion of the entire tech industry, academia, the national security community as well as all industries that rely on encryption and secure products.  In closing, I'd like to thank all the members of the Committee for the dedication in understanding this very complex issue. </p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  Dr. Blaze. </p><p>BLAZE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee for the opportunity to testify before you today.  The encryption issue, which as you know I've been involved with for over two decades now, has been characterized as a question of whether we can build systems that keep the good guys -- a of the good guys in but keep the bad guys out.  And much of the debate has focused on questions of whether we can trust the government with the keys for data.        But before we can ask that question, and that's a legitimate political question that the political process is well equipped to answer, there's an underlying technical question of whether we can trust the technology to actually give us a system that does that.  And unfortunately, we simply don't know how to do that safely and securely at any scale and in general across the wide range of systems that exist today and that we depend on.</p><p>It would be wonderful if we could.  It would solve -- if we could build systems with that kind of assurance, it would solve so many of the problems in computer security and in general computer systems that have been with us since really the very beginning of software-based systems.  But unfortunately many of the problems are deeply fundamental.  </p><p>The state of computer and network security today can really only be characterized as a national crisis.  We hear about large scale data breaches, compromises of personal information, financial information, and national security information literally on a daily basis today. And as systems become more interconnected and become more relied upon for the function of the fabric of our society and for our critical infrastructure, the frequency of these breaches and their consequences have been increasing.</p><p>If computer science had a good solution for making large scale robust software, we would be deploying it with enormous enthusiasm today.  It is really at the core of fundamental problems that we have. But we are fighting a battle against complexity and scale that we are barely able to keep up with.  I wish my field had simpler and better solutions to offer but it simply does not.  </p><p>We have only two good tools, tried and true tools, that work for building reliable robust systems.  One of those is to build the systems to be as simple as possible, to have them include as few functions as possible, to decrease what we call the attack surface of these systems.  Unfortunately we want systems that are more complex and more integrated with other things and that becomes harder and harder to do.</p><p>The second tool we have is photography, which allows us to trust fewer components of the system, rely on fewer component of the system, and manage the inevitable insecurity that we have.  Unfortunately proposals for exceptional access methods that have been advocated by law enforcement, and we heard advocated for by some of the members of the previous panel, work against really the only two tools that we have for building more robust systems, and we need all the help we can get to secure our national infrastructure across the board.  </p><p>There's overwhelming consensus in the technical community that these requirements are incompatible with good security engineering practice.  I can refer you to a paper I collaborated on called Keys Under Door Mats that I referenced in my written testimony that I think describes the consensus of the technical community pretty well here.</p><p>It's unfortunate that this debate has been so focused on this narrow and very potentially dangerous solution of mandates for back doors and exceptional access, because it leaves unexplored potentially viable alternatives that may be quite fruitful for law enforcement going forward. </p><p>One of -- there's no single magic bullet that will solve all of law enforcement problems here, or really anywhere in law enforcement. But a sustained and committed understanding of things like exploitation of data in the cloud, data available in the hands of third parties, targeted exploitation of end devices such as Ms. Hess described in her testimony will require significant resources but have the potential to address many of the problems law enforcement described.  And we owe it to them, and to all of us, to explore them as fully as we can.  Thank you very much.</p><p>WEITZNER:  Thank you Vice Chairman McKinley, Chairman Murphy and Ranking Member DeGette.  Thank you for having me.  I think this hearing comes at a very important time in the debate about how to best accommodate the very real needs of law enforcement in the digital age. I want to say I don't think there's any sense in which law enforcement is exaggerating or overstating the challenges they face and I don't think they should be surprised they have big challenges.  </p><p>We think about introduction of computers in our society, in our workplace and in our homes, to be colloquial, it throws every one for a loop for a little while and our institutions take a while to adjust. We shouldn't expect this problem to be solved overnight.</p><p>I do think that's happening at this point in the debate however is that as some of the previous witnesses said, we are, I think, seeing a growing consensus that introducing mandatory infrastructure- wide back doors is not the right approach.  I'm going to talk about some ways we can move forward but I want so say why I think it is and it comes back to safe-deposit box analogy we heard.  </p><p>We all do think it's reasonable banks should have a second key to our safe-deposit boxes and maybe even you should have drills that can drill through those locks in the event you can't find one of the keys. But the problem here is we're all using the same safe, every single one of us.  So if we make those safe-deposit boxes so that they're a little too easy to drill into or someone gets a hold of the key, then everyone is at risk, not just the couple thousand customers who happen to be at one bank.</p><p>That's why we see political leaders really from all around the world now rejecting the idea of mandatory back doors.  Recently Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said, I'm not a believer in back doors or single technical approach.  I don't think it's realistic, he said. Robert Hanigan, who's the Director of the UK Surveillance Agency GCHQ, said in a talk he delivered at MIT last month that mandatory back doors are not the solution.  He said encryption should not be weakened, let alone banned.  But neither is it true nothing can  be done without weakening encryption.  He said I'm not in favor of weakening encryption or mandatory back doors. </p><p>And very tellingly, the Vice President of the European Commission, who was the former Prime Minister of Estonia and famous for digitizing almost the entire country and the government, said if people know there are back doors, how could people who, for example, vote online trust the results of the election if they know their government has a key to break into the system?  </p><p>Two very quick steps that I think we should avoid going forward, and then a few suggestions about how to approach this challenge that you face.  Number one, I think you've heard us all say we have to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities into an already quite vulnerable information infrastructure. It would nice if we could choose that only the bad guys got weak encryption and the rest of us got all strong encryption but I think we understand that's simply not possible.  </p><p>You've also heard reference to CALEA, a piece of legislation in this committee's jurisdiction.  There have been calls to address the difficult or this very difficult question by simply extending CALEA to apply to internet companies.  But if you look closely at CALEA, it shows just how hard it will be to solve the problem in one size fits all solution.  </p><p>CALEA was targeted to a very small group of telecommunications companies that provided basically all the same product, and were regulated in then a pretty stable way by Federal Communications Commission.  The internet and platform industry and the mobile apps, and device industry is incredibly diverse, global industry.</p><p>And there's no single regulatory agency that governs those services and products.  That's very much by design, and so I think trying to impose a top down regulatory solution on this whole complex of industries in order to solve this problem simply won't work.  </p><p>What can we do going forward?  </p><p>Number one, I think that in the efforts of the encryption working group that this committee and the judiciary committee have set up, I think it's very important to look closely at the specific situations law enforcement faces, at the specific court orders that have been issued which have been successfully satisfied, which haven't, which introduce system wide vulnerabilities if they were followed through and which actually could be pursued without system wide risk.  I think there's a lot to be learned about the best practices both of law enforcement and technology companies.</p><p>And there are probably some law enforcement agencies and technology companies that could up their game a little bit if they had a better sense of how to approach this issue.  I also think it's awfully important that we make sure to preserve public trust in this environment, in this internet environment.  </p><p>I think we understand in the last five years that there's been significant concern from the public about the powers both of government and private sector organizations.  I think it's a great step that the house judiciary committee is moving forward and amendments Electronic Communications Privacy Act that will protect data in the cloud. </p><p>And I think we can do more of that and ensure public that their data is protected both in the context of government surveillance and private sector use that we'll be able to move forward with this issue more constructively.  Thanks very much and I'm looking forward to the discussion. </p><p>MURPHY:  And thank you very much for your testimony and for the whole panel, if I might recognize myself for the first five minutes with some questions.  Mr. Sewell, you made quite a point that you have not provided the source codes to China. That was interesting.  And it had come up in the earlier panel on that.  Were you ever asked to provide by anyone?</p><p>SEWELL:  By the Chinese government or anyone?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes. </p><p>SEWELL:  We have been asked by the Chinese government, we refused. </p><p>MURPHY:  How recent were you asked?</p><p>SEWELL:   Within the past two years.</p><p>MURPHY:  OK.  Mr. Yoran, I've got a couple questions for you. First I was a little taken back, you said don't rush on this solution, or whatever that might be.  As I said earlier, this has been 5 1/2 years I've been hearing everyone talk about it and they are not getting anything done.  I think we're waiting.  I don't know what we're waiting for.  There's got to be a solution.  I'm one of three licensed engineers in Congress. And by now we would have the solution if there were more engineers and less attorneys here, perhaps.</p><p>But if I might, your question, I understand your company was founded by original creators of critical algorithm and public key cryptography.  Needless to say encryption is your company's DNA.  If anyone understands the importance of protecting encryption keys, it's your company.  </p><p>Yet, apparently several years ago, someone stole your seed keys. And as I understand, these are the keys that generate keys, that are used for remote access, much like those used by members and their staff.  If a company like yours, as sophisticated as it is with all the securities that you have, it can lose control of encryption keys, how can we have confidence in others -- and especially smaller companies -- the ability to do the same.  </p><p>YORAN:   Mr. Chairman, I think you bring up two great points. The first statement I would make is that I'd like to highlight the fact a tremendous amount of cooperation happens currently between law enforcement and the tech community.  So the characterization we've made no progress over the last five years I think understates the level of effort put forth by the tech community to reply to and support the efforts of law enforcement.  </p><p>I think what's occurring is -- and I won't call it a line in the sand, but I think the current requests of law enforcement have now gotten to the point where they are requesting a mandate that our product be less secure and will have a tremendous and profound negative impact on our society and public safety as has already been made the point earlier.  </p><p>The second point regarding RSA's own breach I think that highlights the very critical role encryption plays in the entire cyber security puzzle.  The fact that sophisticated threat actors, nation, state or cyber criminals are going to target the supply chain and where strong encryption and strong cyber security capabilities come from.</p><p>We're dealing with incredibly sophisticated adversary and one that would put forth a tremendous effort to find back doors any if they were embedded in our security systems.  It highlights the value of encryption to society in general.  And I think it also highlights the importance of transparency around cyber breaches and cyber security issues.</p><p>MURPHY:   Thank you.  In the first testimony, first panel, stay with you, Mr. Yoran, talked a little bit about security of our infrastructure.  And I think the response was along the line that that's not -- it's not an encryption problem, it's a firewall problem. </p><p>I'm not sure that the American public understands the difference between that.  And so I'm going to go back.  How comfortable should we be, can we be, that we have proper protection on our security from firms like yours that our energy, our transportation system, particularly our grid, as I said, we've been -- we're subject to it. We know we've already been attacked once.  So what more should we be doing?</p><p>YORAN:   Mr. Chairman, I think the point made by the response provided by earlier panelist was wrong.  I think encryption plays an incredibly important role in protecting critical infrastructure.  It is not -- this is a firewall solution or encryption solution, most organizations that truly understand cyber security have a diverse set of products, applications, and many layers of defenses, knowing that adversaries are going to get in through fire walls.  </p><p>Not only adversaries but important openings are created in fire walls so that the appropriate parties can communicate through them as well. And those paths are frequently leveraged by adversaries to do nefarious things.</p><p>MURPHY:  So are you acknowledging then we still are very vulnerable to  someone shutting down our electric grid?</p><p>YORAN:  I believe we're extremely vulnerable in any infrastructure that leverages technology.  How much of it is the entire grid, how much is localized, I certainly believe utilities are exposed. </p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  Let me just say in closing to all four of you, if you've got some suggestions how we might address this, I'm hearing time and time in the district with our grid system, I'd sure like to hear back from you about what we might be able to do.  With that yield the next question from the ranking member from Colorado, Mrs. DeGette.        DEGETTE:   Thank you so much.  Well following up on the last question, I'd like to stipulate that I believe, as most members of the panel believe that strong encryption is really critical to national security and everything else.  </p><p>But as I said in my opening statement, I also recognize that we need to try to give law enforcement the ability to apprehend criminals when criminals are utilizing this technology to be able to commit their crimes and cover up after the crimes.  So, first of all, Mr. Sewell, I believe you testified that your company works with law enforcement now is that correct?  </p><p>SEWELL:  That is correct.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thanks.        And -- and I think that you would also acknowledge that while encryption really does provide benefit both for consumers and for society for security and privacy, we also need to address this thorny issue about how we deal with criminals and terrorists who are using encrypted devices and technologies.  Is that correct?</p><p>SEWELL:  I think this is a very real problem.  And let me start by saying that the conversation we're engaged in now I think has become something of a conflict -- Apple versus the FBI...</p><p>DEGETTE:  Right.  And I don't...</p><p>SEWELL:  ... and that's just the wrong approach.</p><p>DEGETTE:  ... and you don't agree with that, I would hope.  </p><p>SEWELL:  I absolutely do not.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And Mr. Yoran, you don't agree with that, that it's -- that it's technology versus law enforcement, do you?  Yes or no will work.</p><p>YORAN:  No, I don't agree it's technology...</p><p>DEGETTE:  OK.  And I'm assuming that you, Dr. Blaze?</p><p>BLAZE:  No.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And how about you, Mr. Weitzner?  </p><p>WEITZNER:  No.</p><p>DEGETTE:  No.  Well, that's good.</p><p>So, I just -- here's another question, then.  And I asked the last panel that.  Do you think it's a good idea for the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to have to go to third-party hackers to get -- to get access to data for which they have court orders to get?</p><p>SEWELL:  I don't think that's a good idea.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Do you think so, Mr. Yoran?</p><p>YORAN:  No, ma'am.  </p><p>DEGETTE:  Dr. Blaze?</p><p>BLAZE:  No, I think that -- if I could just clarify.  The fact that the FBI had to go to a third party indicates that the FBI either had or devoted insufficient resources to finding a solution...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEGETTE:  Right.  And they couldn't do it on their own. </p><p>Right.  I'm going to get to that in a second.</p><p>So -- so it's just really not a good model.  So -- so, here's my question. </p><p>Mr. Yoran, do you think that the government should enhance it's own capabilities to penetrate encrypted systems and pursue work- arounds when legally entitled to information they cannot obtain either from the user directly or service providers?  Do you think that they should develop that?</p><p>YORAN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Do you think they have the ability to develop that?</p><p>YORAN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Professor, do you think that they have the ability to develop that?</p><p>BLAZE:  It requires enormous resources and they probably, with the resources they currently have, I think it's likely that they don't have the ability...</p><p>DEGETTE:  One thing Congress has.  We may not be Internet experts, but we have resources.</p><p>BLAZE:  Right.  And I think this is a soluble problem.  </p><p>DEGETTE:  Mr. Weitzner?</p><p>WEITZNER:  I think that they certainly should have the resources. I think really the key question is whether they have the personnel. And I think it will take some time to build up a set of...</p><p>DEGETTE:  Well, I understand it will take time, but do you think they can develop those resources?</p><p>WEITZNER:  I think so, absolutely.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thank you.</p><p>OK.  So, Mr. Yoran, I want to ask you another question.  Do you think that all of us supporting the development of increased capability within the government can be a reasonable path forward, as opposing -- as opposed to either relying on third parties or making companies write new software or redesign systems?</p><p>YORAN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Do you think that's a better approach?  OK.</p><p>And I assume, Mr. Sewell, you probably agree with that, too.</p><p>SEWELL:  I'd agree that we ought to spend more money, time, resources on the FBI and on local law enforcement...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEGETTE:  And would Apple be willing to help them develop those capabilities?</p><p>SEWELL:  We actively do participate in helping them.</p><p>DEGETTE:  So your answer would be yes.</p><p>SEWELL:  That we would -- we would participate in training.  We would...</p><p>DEGETTE:  And helping them develop those new capabilities.  </p><p>SEWELL:  We -- what we can do is to help them understand our ecosystem.  </p><p>DEGETTE:  Right.</p><p>SEWELL:  That's what we do on a daily basis.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Right.  I'm not trying to trick you.</p><p>SEWELL:  No, I'm not -- I'm not responding...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEGETTE:  Yeah, OK.</p><p>So -- so, I guess -- I guess, then, your answer would be yes, you're willing to help us in conjunction with law enforcement and Congress to solve this problem.</p><p>Is that correct, Mr. Sewell?</p><p>SEWELL:  I want to solve the problem just like everyone else.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And are you willing to work with law enforcement and Congress to do it?  Yes or no?</p><p>SEWELL:  Congressman, we work with them every day.  Yes, of course...</p><p>DEGETTE:  Yes or no will work.  </p><p>SEWELL:  ... of course, we are.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Yoran?</p><p>YORAN:  Yes, ma'am.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Professor Blaze?</p><p>BLAZE:  Absolutely.</p><p>DEGETTE:  And Mr. Weitzner?</p><p>WEITZNER:  Yes.</p><p>DEGETTE:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>And now recognize Mr. Griffith from Virginia.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I greatly appreciate that.</p><p>My background -- I'm just a small college history major who then went into law.  And as a part of that, Mr. Sewell, I would have to ask, would you agree with me that it took in the history of mankind, it took us thousands of years to come up with the concept of civil liberties and that perhaps five-and-a-half years isn't such a long time to try to find a solution to this current issue.</p><p>And likewise, that it would be -- it was -- the answer was in the affirmative, for those who may not have heard that.</p><p>SEWELL:  It was.  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  And that it was lawyers who actually created the concept of individual liberty, and one that our country has been proud to be the leader in the world in promoting.  Would that also be true?</p><p>SEWELL:  That's very true, sir.  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  That being said, I was very pleased to hear in the answers to Ms. DeGette that all of you were willing to help us solve this problem, because there is no easy answer.  I liked the safety deposit box analogy.</p><p>Mr. Weitzner, thanks for (inaudible) that for me in your analysis.</p><p>But I would ask Mr. Sewell if there isn't some way, and again I can't do what you all do.  So I have to simplify it to my terms.  Is there some way that we can create the vault that the banks have with the safety deposit box in it, and then once you're inside of there, if you want that security -- because not everybody has a safety deposit box -- but if you want that security, that then there's a system of a dual, but separate keys with companies like yours or others holding one of the two keys, and then the individual holding the other key. And then having the ability to, with a proper search warrant, have law enforcement be able to get in.</p><p>Is there some -- I mean, I'm trying to break it down in to a concept I can understand, where I can then apply what we have determined over the course of the last several hundred years is the appropriate way to get at information.  And it's difficult in this electronic age.</p><p>SEWELL:  It is very difficult, Congressman, I agree.  We haven't figured out a way that we can create an access point.  And then create a set of locks that are reliable to protect access through that access point.  </p><p>That's what we struggle with.  We can create an access point and we can create locks.  But the problem is that the keys to that lock will ultimately be available somewhere.  And if they're available anywhere, they can be accessed by both good guys and bad guys.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  So you would agree with Mr. Weitzner's position or his analysis, which I thought was accurate, is that the problem is we're not giving a key and a drill to one safety deposit box.  It's everybody in the bank who suddenly would have that information then open.  </p><p>And I saw that you wanted to make a comment, Mr. Weitzner.</p><p>WEITZNER:  I just want to, since this analogy seems to be working, you know, we don't put much stuff in our safe deposit boxes, right?  I mean, I actually don't have one, to be honest.  And I think that there's this core concern, back to your -- your civil liberties framework, that somehow we have a warrant-free zone that's going to take over the world.</p><p>I think that if you follow the safety deposit box analogy, what we know is that the information that's important to law enforcement exists in many places.  And I don't question that there will be sometimes when law enforcement can't get some piece of information it wants.  But I think what you're hearing from a number of us and from the technical community is that this information is very widely distributed, and much of it is accessible in one way or the other or inferable from information that's produced by other third parties.</p><p>And I think that part of the path forward is to really understand how to exploit that to the best extent possible in investigations so that we're not all focused on the hardest part of the problem.  Where the hardest part of the problem is what do you do if you have very strongly encrypted data -- can you ever get it?  It may not be the best place to look all the time because it may not always be available.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  And of course, historically, you were never able to get a hold of everything.  </p><p>Dr. Blaze, you wanted to weigh in.</p><p>BLAZE:  So, I just want to caution that the split-T (ph) design, as attractive as it sounds, was also at the core of the NSA-designed clipper chip, which was where we started over two decades ago.</p><p>GRIFFITH:  I appreciate that.</p><p>Mr. Yoran, I've got to tell you, I did think your testimony -- and your written testimony in particular was enlightening in regard to the fact that if we do shut down the U.S. companies, then there may even be safe havens created by those companies that are not our friends, and are specifically our enemies.  And unfortunately, I wanted to ask a series of questions on that, but I see that my time has expired.  And so I am required to yield back, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  I welcome the -- looking at other panel members.  We have Ms. Brooks from Indiana, your five minutes.</p><p>BROOKS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I'd like to start out with a comment that was made in the first panel.  And I guess this is to Mr. Sewell, whether or not you can share with us.</p><p>Does Apple plan to use encryption in the cloud?</p><p>SEWELL:  We've made no such announcement.  I'm not sure where that statement came from.  But we've made no such announcement.</p><p>BROOKS:  OK.  I understand you've made no such announcement, but is that being explored?</p><p>SEWELL:  I think it would be irresponsible for me to come here and tell you that we are not even looking at that.  But we have made no announcement, no decision has been made.</p><p>BROOKS:  And are these discussions helping inform Apple's decisions?  And are -- is Apple communicating with any law enforcement about that possibility?</p><p>SEWELL:  These discussions are enormously -- enormously helpful. And I'd be glad to go further into that.  I've learned some things today that I didn't know before.  So they're extremely important.</p><p>We are considering -- we are talking to people.  We are being very mindful of the environment in which we're operating.</p><p>BROOKS:  And I have certainly seen, and I know that Apple and many companies have a whole set of policies and procedures on compliance with legal processes and so forth.  And so I assume that you have regular conversations with policy makers of law enforcement, whether it's FBI or other agencies on these policy issues.</p><p>Is that correct?      SEWELL:  That's very correct.  I interact with law enforcement at two very different levels.  One is a very operational level.  My team supports daily activities in response to lawful processes.  We work very closely on actual investigations.  I can mention at least two where we've recently found children who've been abducted.  We've been able to save lives, working directly with our colleagues in law enforcement.</p><p>So at that level, we have a very good relationship.  And I think that gets lost in the debate sometimes.</p><p>At the other side, I work at perhaps a different level.  I work directly with my counterpart at the FBI.  I work directly with the most senior people in the Department of Justice.  And I work with senior people in local law enforcement on exactly these policy issues.</p><p>BROOKS:  And I thank you and all the others for cooperating with law enforcement and working on these issues.  But it seems as if most recently, there have not been enough of -- enough of the discussions. Hence, that's why we're having these hearings and why we need to continue to have these hearings.  </p><p>But I think that -- that we have to continue to have the dialogue on the policy while continuing to work on the actual cases, and recognize that -- that obviously technology companies have been tremendously helpful and we need them to be tremendously helpful in solving crimes and in preventing future crimes. </p><p>I mean, it's not just about solving crimes already perpetrated, but it's always, particularly with respect to terrorism, how do we ensure that we're keeping the country safe.  </p><p>I'm curious with respect to a couple of questions with respect to legal hacking.  And what -- and the types of costs that are associated with legal hacking, as well as the personnel needed.  And since the newer designs of iPhones prevent the bypassing of the built-in encryption, does Apple actually believe that lawful hacking is an appropriate method for investigators to use to assess the evidence in investigations?</p><p>SEWELL:  So, I don't think we have a firm position on that.  I think there are questions that would have to be answered with respect to what the outcome of that lawful hacking is; what happens to the product of that lawful hacking.</p><p>So I don't have a formal corporate position on that.</p><p>BROOKS:  But so then because that has been promoted, so to speak, as far as a way around this difficult issue, are you having those policy discussions about Apple's view and the technology sector's view on lawful hacking?  Are those discussions happening with law enforcement?</p><p>SEWELL:  I think this is a very nascent area for us.  But particularly the question is what happens to the result.  Does it get disclosed?  Does it not get disclosed?  That I think is an issue that has not been well explored.</p><p>BROOKS:  Mr. Yoran, do you have an opinion on lawful hacking?</p><p>YORAN:  Not an opinion on lawful hacking in specific.  But I would just point out that doing encryption properly is very, very hard.  Trying to keep information secret in the incredibly interconnected world that we live in is very, very hard.  And I would suggest that it's getting harder, not easier.</p><p>So the -- the information, the data that law enforcement has access to I think is certainly much more than the metadata that they've had over the last several years.  But now as applications go into the cloud, those cloud application providers need to access the data.</p><p>So the sensitive information is not just on your iPhone or other device, it's sitting in the cloud, and law enforcement has access there because it cannot be encrypted.  It needs to be accessed by the cloud provider in order to do the sophisticated processing and provide the insight to the consumer that they're looking for.</p><p>BROOKS:  My time has expired.  I have to yield back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>And now seeing no other members of the subcommittee that are with us, we can then go to...</p><p>UNKNOWN:  Mr. Chairman?  I'm sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MURPHY:  You're on the subcommittee?  OK.  We're going now to the -- none on the subcommittee, so now we're going to members that have been given privileges to speak.  And I was advised I was to go to the other side, like a ping-pong game.  And Ms. Eshoo from California, your five minutes.</p><p>ESHOO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>First of all, to Mr. Yoran, I love your suit and tie.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ESHOO:  It brings a little of the flavor of my district into this big old hearing room.  And warm welcome to your mother.  I don't know where she is, but it's great to have your mother here.  Great. Wonderful.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I know that Associate Professor Blaze talked about the crisis of the vulnerability in our country relative to, you know, how our systems -- how vulnerable our systems are.  I would just like to add for the record that up to 90 percent of the breaches in our system in our country are due to two major factors.  One is systems that are less than hygiene -- unhygienic systems.  Number two, very poor security management.</p><p>So I think the Congress should come up with at least a floor relative to standards.  And so that we can move that word \"crisis\" away from this.  But we really can do something about that.  I know it costs money to keep systems up and there are some that don't invest in it.  But that can be addressed.</p><p>The word \"conversation\" has been used, and I think very appropriately.  And this is a very healthy hearing.  Unfortunately, the first thing the American people heard was a very powerful federal agency on the -- you know, within moments of the tragedy in San Bernardino, demand of a private company that they must do thus and so; otherwise, we will be forever pitted against one another, and there is no other resolution except what I call a swinging door that people can go in and out of.</p><p>When I say \"people,\" in this case, it's the government.  Now, the American people have a health suspicion of big brother.  But they also have a healthy suspicion of big corporations.  They just do.  It's in our DNA.  And I don't think that's an unhealthy thing.</p><p>But that first snapshot I think we need to move to the next set of pictures on this.  And I'm heartened that the panel seems to be unanimous that this weakening of our overall system by having a backdoor, by having a swinging door is not the way to go.</p><p>So, in going past that, I'd like to ask Mr. Sewell the following. Whether introducing the third-party access, and that's been talked about -- I think that would fundamentally weaken our security.  How does third-party access impact security?  How likely do you think it is that law enforcement could design a system to address encrypted data that would not carry with it the unanticipated weaknesses of its own?</p><p>I'm worried about law enforcement in this.  And I want to put this on the record as well.  I think that it says something that the FBI didn't know what it was doing when it got a hold of that phone. And that's not good for us.  It's not going to attract smart young people to come into a federal agency because what it says to them is they don't know what -- it doesn't seem to us they know what they're doing. </p><p>So can you address this third-party access and what kind of effect it would have on overall security?</p><p>SEWELL:  Thank  you very much for the question, Congressman.</p><p>If you allow third-party access, you have to give the third party a portal in which to exercise that access.  This is fundamentally the definition of a back door or a swinging door, as you've I think very aptly described it.  </p><p>There is no way that we know of to create that vulnerability; to create that access point and more particularly to maintain it.  This was the issue in San Bernardino, was not just give us an access point, but maintain that access point in perpetuity so that we can get in over and over and over again.</p><p>That, for us -- we have no way of doing that without undermining and endangering the entire encryption infrastructure.  We believe that strong ubiquitous encryption is the best way that we can maintain the safety, security and privacy of all of our users.  So that would be fundamentally a problem.  </p><p>ESHOO:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your legislative courtesy.  Again, thank you to the witnesses.  You have been, I think, most helpful.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I thank the witnesses, too.  I apologize.  I had to run out for a while, but I'd like to ask a few questions here and want to make sure -- follow-up.  </p><p>So Mr. Sewell, we can all understand the benefits of strong encryption, whether it's keeping someone's own bank statement, financial records encrypted, so we don't have to worry about hackers there.  We all saw some pretty compelling testimony in the first (inaudible) about law enforcement, criminal activity, child predators, homicide, et cetera.  Based on your experience, what we heard today, can you acknowledge that the spread of default encryption does present a challenge for law enforcement?  </p><p>SEWELL:  I think it absolutely does.  And I would not suggest for a moment that law enforcement is overstating this -- this -- the same claim that has been made by other panelists.  I think the problem is that there's a fundamental disconnect between the way we see the world and the way law enforcement sees the world, and that's where I think we ought to be focusing.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And what is that disconnect?  What is that two different world views?</p><p>SEWELL:  The disconnect has to do with the evolution of technology in society and the impact of that technology in society. What you have heard from our colleagues in law enforcement is that the context in which encryption occurs reduces the scope of useful data that they have access to.  This going dark problem.  But if you talk to technologists, we see the world in a very different way.  We see the impact of technology is actually a burgeoning of information.  We see that there's an abundance of information, and this will only increase exponentially as we move into a world where the internet of things becomes part of our reality.  </p><p>So you hear on one side, we're going dark, and you hear on the other side, there's an abundance of information.  That circle needs to be squared, and the only way that I think we can do that is by cooperating and talking and engaging in the kind of activity that the Madam Degette was suggesting.  We need to work together so...</p><p>MURPHY:  So let me bring this...      SEWELL:  ... that we understand their perspective and they understand ours.</p><p>MURPHY:  I appreciate that, but I'm not -- it's a very compelling argument you gave, but I have no idea what you just said.  So let me try and put this into terms that we can all talk about.  </p><p>SEWELL:  Sure.</p><p>MURPHY:  We hear testimony from the first panel of child predators who are able to hide behind this invisible cloak.  A murder scene where they could have perhaps caught who did this.  We know that when it comes to crimes, there are those who just won't commit crimes because they have a good moral compass.  We have those who will commit them anyway because they have none.  We also have those who can be deterred because they think they might get caught.  </p><p>And when it comes to other issues, such as terrorist acts, where you can get into a cell phone or something from someone who has committed an act, you know that you can find out if they're planning more and save other lives.  So what do you tell a family member who has had their child abused and assaulted in unspeakable forms?  What do you tell them about burgeoning technology?  I mean, tell me what comfort we can give someone about the future?  </p><p>SEWELL:  I think in situations like that, of course, they're tragic.  I'm not sure that there's anything which I or any one of us could say that would help to ease that pain.  On the other hand, we deal with this every day.  We deal with cases where children have been abducted.  We work directly with law enforcement to try to solve those crimes.  We had a 14-year-old girl from Pennsylvania just recently that was abducted by her captor.  We worked immediately with the FBI in order to use IP logs to identify the location where she had been stashed.  We were able to get feet on the ground within a matter of hours, find that woman, rescue her, and apprehend...</p><p>MURPHY:  And that's good and I appreciate that.  But what about -- I look at this case, it was presented, though, when someone may have a lot of information hidden, and if they could get in there, whether it is child predators or it is a terrorist where we could try and prevent more harm.  </p><p>SEWELL:  And we're -- we're missing the point of technology, here.  The problems that we're trying to solve don't have an easy fix...</p><p>MURPHY:  I know that, but tell me -- I need to know you're working in a direction that helps.  </p><p>SEWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MURPHY:  That's what I'm trying to help you...</p><p>SEWELL:  Photo DNA, hashing images so that when those images move across the internet, we can identify them.  We can track them.  The work that we do with Operation Railroad is exactly that.  It's an example of taking technology, taking feet on the ground, law enforcement techniques and marrying them together in a way that fundamentally changes...</p><p>MURPHY:  And for people who are using encrypted sources, whether it's by default or intention, to hide their data and their intention and their harmful activity that they're planning on hurting more, what do we -- what do we tell the public about that?  </p><p>SEWELL:  We tell the public that fundamentally, we're working on the problem and that we believe strong ubiquitous encryption provides the best and safest...</p><p>MURPHY:  So does that mean Apple is going to be working with the FBI and law enforcement on this problem?  I know that the response of Apple was we ought to have a commission.  You're looking at the commission, the Energy and Commerce Committee, Oversight Investigation Committee, and we want to find solutions.  We want to work with you. And I'm pleased you're here today.  </p><p>And you heard many of us say we don't think there's right or wrong absolutes.  This is not black and white.  We're all in this together and we want to work on that.  I need to know about your commitment, too, in working with law enforcement.  Could you make a statement on that?</p><p>SEWELL:  Could I tell you a story, Congressman?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Sure.</p><p>SEWELL:  Can I actually do that?  I sat opposite my counterpart at the FBI, a person that I know very well.  We don't talk frequently, but we talk regularly.  We're on a first-name basis.  I sat opposite him and said amidst all this clamor and rancor, why don't we set aside a day?  We'll send some smart people to Washington or you send some smart people to Cupertino (ph) and what we'll do for that day is that we'll talk to you about what the world looks like from our perspective.  What is this explosion of data that we can see?  Why do we think it's so important?  And you talk to us about the world that confront your investigators from the moment they wake up in the morning.  How do they think about technology?  How do they think about the problems that they're trying to solve?  </p><p>And we were going to sit down together for a day.  We were planning that at the time that the San Bernardino case was filed. That got put on hold.  But that offer still exists.  That's the way we're going to solve these problems.  </p><p>DEGETTE:  Mr. Chairman?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes?  </p><p>DEGETTE:  Will you yield for one second?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>DEGETTE:  You know, Mr. Sewell, if -- if -- if we can facilitate that meeting in any way, I'm sure the chairman and I would be more than happy to do that and we have some very lovely conference rooms that are painted this very same color, courtesy of Chairman Upton, and we'll have you there.  </p><p>SEWELL:  Madam, if we can get out of the lawsuit world...</p><p>DEGETTE:  You know what?  </p><p>SEWELL:  ... let's start cooperating.</p><p>DEGETTE:  You know what?  I'm -- that would be great.  Thank you. </p><p>MURPHY:  We want that to be facilitated.  We have too many lives at stake and the concerns of many families and Americans.  This is -- this is central, this is core.  </p><p>SEWELL:  I agree.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I know I'm out of time.  </p><p>Mr. Bilirakis is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it so very much.  I want to thank everyone here on the panel for your technology leadership that helps us keep -- keeps us safe, because that's what our top priority here is in the United States Congress, at least it's mine and I know many others on this panel.  We're here to try to find a balance between security and privacy and not continue to pit them against each other.  I think you'll agree with that.  </p><p>Mr. Yoran, how quickly does one life cycle of encryption last as a secure system until vulnerabilities are found and exploited?  Will this continually be a game of cat and mouse or are we at a level now where software and the processes are strong enough to make end-to-end encryption a stable system?  </p><p>YORAN:  Systems are attacked and vulnerabilities are exploited almost instantaneously once computer systems, mobile devices are put on the internet.  Once crypto methods are published, there's an entire research community that goes to work.  Depending on the strength of the encryption, vulnerabilities may be discovered immediately or they may be discovered decades down the road, in which case all of the information may have been at risk while that crypto system was in use. </p><p>And frequently, the exposure and the exploitation of crypto systems isn't necessarily based on the strength of the algorithms themselves, but on how they're implemented and how the systems are interconnected.  I might not have the key to get information off of a particular device, but because I can break into the operating system because I have physical access to it, because I can read the chips, because I can do all sorts of different things, I can still get information or I can get the key while it as resonant in memory.  It's just a very complex system.  It all has to work perfectly in order for the information to be protected.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.  All right.  Next question is for the entire panel.  We've known for the past few years that any significant threat to our homeland will likely include a cyberattack.  Will you agree on that?  </p><p>Can you elaborate on the role that encryption plays in this process of continuing national security?  Certainly, the military has used forms of encryption for decades.  But can we -- can you give us a contemporary snapshot of how encryption used by government or non- government users protect us against cyberattacks today?  We can start over here, please.  </p><p>SEWELL:  I will answer the question, but I'm not at all the expert in this space.  I think the other panelists are much more expert than I am in the notion of encryption and protecting our infrastructure.  The one point that I will say that I tried to emphasize in my opening statement was that we shouldn't forget about some of the changes that are happening in terms of the way that infrastructure can be accessed.  I think we sometimes lose sight of the fact that phones themselves now are being used as authentication devices.  </p><p>If you can break the encryption and get into the phone, that may be a very easy way to get into the power grid, to get into our transport systems, into our water systems.  So it's not just a question of the firewalls or the access.  It's how -- what is the instrumentality that you use to get into those things that we also have to be concerned about.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Yoran?</p><p>YORAN:   I believe fundamentally that security is actually on the same side as privacy and our economic interest.  It's fundamental -- it's fundamental in the national security community, but it's also mandated by law to protect all sorts of other data in other infrastructures and systems, such as financial services, health care records, so on and so forth, such that even folks who might not gain an advantage by having strong encryption available, like general -- I'm sorry -- Admiral Rogers, the director of the NSA, and James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, are on the record saying that they believe it's not in the U.S. best interests to weaken encryption.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Anyone else wish to comment?  </p><p>BLAZE:  I mean, encryption is used in protecting critical infrastructure the same way it's used in protecting other aspects of our -- of our society.  It protects sensitive data when it's being transmitted and stored, including on mobile devices and over the internet and so on.  </p><p>I just want to add that critical infrastructure systems are largely based and built upon the same components that we're using in consumer and business devices as well.  There aren't -- you know, critical infrastructure systems essentially depend on mobile phones and operating systems that you and I are using in our day-to-day life. So when we weaken them, we also weaken the critical infrastructure systems.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Sir?</p><p>WEITZNER:  Could I just add briefly that I actually thought Mr. Sewell's answer was pretty good.  But -- and what's critical about those systems that we rely on to protect our critical infrastructure is that when we find flaws in them, we have to patch them quickly, we have to fix them quickly.  </p><p>As Mr. Yoran said, these systems are constantly being looked at. I'm concerned if we end up imposing requirements on our security infrastructure on our encryption tools, if we impose (inaudible) requirements, the process of identifying flaws, fixing them, putting out new versions rapidly, is going to be slowed down to figure out whether those comply with whatever the surveillance requirements are and I think that's the wrong direction for us to go in.  </p><p>We want to make these tools as adaptive as possible.  We want them to be fixed as quickly as possible.  Not be caught in a whole set of rules about what they have to do and not do to accommodate surveillance needs.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate. Appreciate it, and I'll yield back.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from CTA be admitted to the record.  Without objection, that will be so.</p><p>And I believe -- Ms. Degette?</p><p>DEGETTE:  I would ask unanimous consent, Ms. Eshoo has a letter from TechNet that's dated April 19 that we'd like to have put on the record.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>I would also ask unanimous consent that the contents of the document binder be introduced in the record and authorize staff to make any appropriate redactions.  Without objection, the documents will be entered into the record with any redactions the staff determines are appropriate.  </p><p>And in conclusion, I want to thank all the witnesses and members that participated in today's hearing.  I remind members, they have 10 business days to submit questions for the record.  I ask that the witnesses all agree to respond promptly to the questions.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to hearing from you more and we'll get you together.  </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>UNKNOWN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>MURPHY:  This committee is adjourned.

Before I start with my statement, I want to let everyone know we have multiple hearings going on today and tomorrow we're having a hearing as well.  </p><p>       So you will see people coming and going, so especially for our witnesses, so you don't think that it's chaos, we have members trying to juggle a lot of things at the same time.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This is chaos.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  It is chaos, OK.  I stand corrected.  We're meeting today to consider the deceptively complex question -- should the government have the ability to lawfully access encrypted technology and communications?  This is the question at the center of a heated public debate catalyzed earlier this year, when the FBI obtained a court order to compel Apple to assist in unlocking an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists.  </p><p>       But this isn't a new question.  Strong encryption has existed for decades.  For years, motivated individuals have had access to the tools necessary to conceal their activities from law enforcement, and for years, the government has repeatedly tried to limit the use of or obtain access to encrypted data.  </p><p>      The most notable example occurred in the 1990s; the development of encrypted communications equipment sparked fears that the government would lose its ability to conduct lawful surveillance.  In response, the NSA developed a new encryption chip called the Clipper Chip.  </p><p>      That would enable encrypted communications but would also provide the government with key to access those communications if necessary. This so-called back door sparked intense debate between the government and the technology community about the benefits and risks of government access to encrypted technology.  </p><p>      One of the principal arguments of the technology community was such a back door would create a vulnerability that could be exploited by actors outside of the government.  This concern was validated when a critical flaw was discovered in the Chip's design.  I should note that one of our witnesses today, Dr. Matt Blaze, identified that vulnerability which made the government's back door more akin to a front door.  </p><p>      As a partial solution, Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act called CALEA.  CALEA addressed the government's concern that rapidly evolving technologies were curtailing their ability to conduct lawful surveillance by requiring telecommunication providers to provide assistance in executing authority or authorized surveillance.  </p><p>       However, the law included notable caveats, which limited the government's response to encrypted technologies.  After the government relaxed export controls on encryption in 2000, the crypto wars entered a period of relative quiet.  </p><p>      So what has changed in recent years to renew the debate?  Part of the concern is, once again, the rapid expansion of technology.  At its core, however, this debate is about the widespread availability of encryption by default.  </p><p>      Well, encryption has existed for decades.  Until recently, was complex, cumbersome and hard to use.  It took effort and sophistication to employ its benefits either for good or evil.  </p><p>       But because of this, law enforcement was still able to gain access to the majority of the digital evidence they discovered in their investigations.  But now, the encryption of electronic data is the norm, it's the default.  </p><p>      This is a natural response to escalating concerns both from government and consumers about the security of digital information. The decision by companies like Apple and the messaging (ph) application WhatsApp to provide default encryption, means more than a billion people -- including some living in countries with repressive governments -- have the benefit of easy, reliable encryption.  </p><p>      At the same time, however, criminals and terrorists have the same access to secure means of communication and they know it and they will use it as their own mission control center.  That is the crux of the recent debate.  </p><p>      Access to secure technologies beyond the reach of law enforcement no longer requires coordination or sophistication, is available to anyone and to everyone.  At the same time, however, as more of our lives become dependent on the internet and information technologies, the availability of widespread encryption is critical to our personal economic and national security.  </p><p>      Therefore, while many of the arguments in the current debate may echo those of decades past, the circumstances of change and so too must the discussion.  We can no longer be a battle between two sides, a choice between black and white. </p><p>      If we take that approach, the only outcome is that we all lose. This is a core issue of public safety and ethics and it requires a very thoughtful approach.  That is why we're here today to begin moving the conversation from Apple versus the FBI or right versus wrong, to construct a dialogue that recognizes this is a complex issue that affects everyone and therefore we are all in this together.  </p><p>      We have two very strong panels.  And I expect each will make strong arguments about the benefits of strong encryption and the challenges it presents for law enforcement.  I encourage my colleagues to embrace this opportunity to learn from the experts to better understand the multiple perspectives, layers and complexities of the issues.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  It is time to begin a new chapter in this battle, one of which I hope can ultimately bring some resolution to the war.  This process will not be easy, but if it does not happen now, we may reach a time when it is too late and success becomes impossible.    </p><p>      So, for everyone on calling on Congress to address this issue, here we are.  I can only hope moving forward, you will be willing to join us at the table.  </p><p>      I now recognize the ranking member from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this important hearing.  </p><p>      Issues surrounding encryption, and particularly the disagreements between law enforcement and the tech community, gained significant public attention in the San Bernardino case, but I'm not particularly interested in re-litigating that dispute today.  </p><p>      As you said, Mr. Chairman, the conversation needs to be broader than just that one case.  </p><p>      Let me state unequivocally that I, like you, and I think the rest of us here today, recognize and appreciate the benefits of strong encryptions in today's digital world.  It keeps our communications secure, our critical infrastructure safe and our bank accounts from being drained.  It also provides each one of us with significant privacy protections.  But also like you, I see the flip side of the coin.  </p><p>      While encryption does provide these invaluable protections, it can also be used to obscure the communications and plots of criminals and terrorists, an increasingly great risk.  It's our task to help find the proper balance between those competing interests.  We need to ask both the industry and law enforcement some hard questions today.    </p><p>      Last month, the president said, for example, quote, \"We want strong encryption, because part of us preventing terrorism or preventing people from disrupting the financial system is that hackers, state or non-state, can't get in there and mess around,\" end quote.  But if we make systems that are impenetrable or warrant proof, how do we stop criminals and terrorists?  </p><p>      If you can't crack these systems, President Obama said, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.  </p><p>      I've heard the tech community's concern that some of the policies being proposed, like creating a back door for law enforcement, will undermine the encryption that everybody needs to keep them safe.  And as they remind us, a back door for good guys ultimately becomes a front door for criminals.  The tech community has been particularly vocal about the negative consequences of proposals to address the encryption challenge.    </p><p>      I think many of these arguments are valid, but I've only heard what we should not do, not what we should do, collectively, to address this challenge.  </p><p>       I think the discussion needs to include a dialogue about how to move forward.  I can't believe that this problem is intractable.  Now, the same thing seems to be true from where I sit for law enforcement, which raises legitimate concerns, but doesn't seem to be focused on workable solutions.    </p><p>      I don't promote forcing industry to build back doors or other circumventions that experts will tell us will undermine security or privacy for all of us.  At the same time, I'm not comfortable with impenetrable warrant-proof spaces where criminals or terrorists can operate without any fear that law enforcement could discover their plots.  </p><p>      So, what I want to hear today is from both law enforcement and industry about possible solutions going forward.  For example, if we conclude that expansive warrant-proof spaces are not acceptable in society, then what are the policy options?    </p><p>      What happens if -- if encryption is the reason law enforcement can't solve or prevent a crime?  If the holder or transmitter of the data or device can't or won't help law enforcement, what then?  What are suitable options?    </p><p>      Last week, for the example, The Washington Post reported that the government relied on hat hackers to circumvent the San Bernardino iPhone.  Well, thank goodness?  I don't think so.  I don't think relying on a third party is a good model.  </p><p>      This recent San Bernardino case suggests that when the government needs to enhance its capabilities when it comes to exploring ways to work around the challenges posed by encryption.  I intend to ask both panels what additional resources and capabilities the government needs to keep pace with technology, while providing government with more tools or capability require additional discussions regarding due process, and the protection of civil liberties.  Enhancing the government's technical capability is one potential solution that does not mandate back doors.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Finally the public, the tech community, and the government are all in this together.  In that spirit, I really do want to thank our witnesses for coming today.  I hope -- I'm happy that we have people from law enforcement, academia and industry, and I'm really happy that Apple came to testify today.  </p><p>      Your voice is particularly important, because other players like Facebook and WhatsApp declined our invitation to be a part of this panel.  Now, the tech community has told Congress we need to solve this problem.  And we agree, but I've got to tell you, it's hard to solve a problem when the key players won't show up for the discussion.  </p><p>      And I'm here also to tell you as a longtime member of the subcommittee, relying on Congress to on its own, pass legislation in a very complex situation like this, is a blunt instrument at best.  I think it would be in everybody's best interest to come to the table and help us work on a solution.  </p><p>      Thanks again for holding this hearing.  I know we won't trivialize these concerns.  I look forward to work with everybody to come up with a reasonable solution.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Gentlewoman (ph) yields back.  </p><p>      I now recognize chairman of the full committee Mr. Upton for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UPTON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      For months now, we witnessed an intense and important debate between law enforcement and the technology community about encryption. While much of this recent debate is focused on the FBI and Apple, this issue is certainly much bigger than any one entity, device, application or piece of technology.  </p><p>      At its very core, this is a debate about what we as a society are willing to accept.  If you paid any attention to the debate, it might appear to be a black-and-white choice.  Either we side with law enforcement and grant them access to encrypted technologies, thus weakening the security and privacy of our digital infrastructure.  </p><p>      Or we can side with the technology community and prevent law enforcement from accessing encrypted technologies, thus creating a warrant less safe haven for terrorists, pedophiles and other evil and terrible actors. </p><p>      It's important that we move beyond the us versus them mentality that's encompassed this discussion for far too long.  This debate is not about picking sides, it is about evaluating options.  It begins by acknowledging the equities on both sides.  From the technology perspective, there's no doubt that strong encryption is a benefit to our society.  </p><p>       As more of our daily lives become integrated with the digital universe, encryption is critical to the security and privacy of our personal and corporate secrets.  As evidenced by the breaches over the past year, data theft can have a devastating effect on our personal privacy, economic strength and national security.  </p><p>      In addition, encryption doesn't just enable terrorists and wrongdoers to do terrible things, it also provides a safe haven for decedents, victims of domestic violence and others who wish to remain hidden for noble purposes.  And as we look to the future and see that more and more aspects of our lives will become connected to the internet, including such things as our cars, medical devices and the electric grid, encryption will play an important role in minimizing the risk of physical harm or loss of life should these technologies be compromised.  </p><p>      From the law enforcement perspective, while strong encryption helps protect information and lives, it also presents a serious risk to public safety.  As a strong inaccessible encryption becomes the norm, law enforcement loses access to valuable tools and evidence necessary to stop bad actors from doing terrible things.  </p><p>       And as we will hear today, this cannot always be offset by alternative means, such as Metadata or other investigative tools. There are certain situations, such as identifying the victims of child exploitation, not just the perpetrators, where access to content is critical.  </p><p>      These are about a few of the many valid reasons on both sides of this debate, which leads us to the question, what's the answer, sitting here today?  I don't have the answer, nor do I expect that we'll find it during this hearing.  </p><p>      This is a complex issue and it's going to require a lot of difficult conversations, but that is not an excuse to put our head in the sane or resort to default positions.  We need to confront these issues head-on because they're not going to go away and they're only going to get more difficult as time continuing to tick.  </p><p>      Identifying a solution to this problem may involve tradeoffs and compromise on both sides, but ultimately it comes down to what society accepts as the appropriate balance between government access to encryption and security of encrypted technologies.  </p><p>      For that reason and others, many have called on us -- us, this committee, to confront the issues here.  That's why we're holding this hearing and that's why Chairman Goodlatte and I, along with Ranking Members Pallone and Conyers established a bipartisan joint committee working group to examine this very issue. </p><p>      In order for Congress to successfully confront the issue, however, it will require patience, creativity, courage and more importantly, cooperation.  It's easy to call on Congress to take on an issue, but you better be prepared to answer the call when we do.  </p><p>      This issue is too important to have key players sitting on the sidelines and therefore I hope all of you are prepared to participate as we take to heart what we hear today and be part of the solution moving forward.  </p><p>       And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Gentleman yields back (ph).  </p><p>      I now recognize Mr. Pallone, for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I welcome the opportunity to hear today from both law enforcement and the tech community as we seek to understand and develop solutions to this encryption debate.  </p><p>      Encryption enables the privacy and security that we value but it also creates challenges for those seeking to protect us.  Law enforcement has a difficult job of keeping our nation safe and they're finding that some encrypted devices and programs are hampering their efforts to conduct thorough investigations.  </p><p>      Even when they obtain a warrant, they find themselves unable to access information protected by end-to-end encryption.  And this raises questions of how comfortable we are as a nation with these dark areas that cannot be reached by law enforcement.  </p><p>      At the same time, the tech community helps protect some of our most valuable information and the most secure way to do that is by using end-to-end encryption, meaning the divide or app manufacturer does not hold the key to that information.  </p><p>      When the tech community tells us that providing back doors will make their job of protecting our information that much more difficult, we should heed that warning and work towards a solution that will not solve one problem by creating many others.  </p><p>      It's clear that both sides in this discussion have compelling arguments, but simply repeating those arguments is not a sufficient response.  We need to work together to move forward and I hope today's hearing is just the beginning of that conversation.  </p><p>      In the last several months and years we have seen major players in this debate look to Congress for solutions.  In 2014, FBI Director Comey said, and I quote, \"I'm happy to work with Congress, with our partners in the private sector and with my law enforcement and national security counterparts and with the people we serve to find the right answer, to find the balance we need.\"  </p><p>      In an e-mail to Apple employees earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote about his support for Congress to bring together and I quote, \"experts on intelligence technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms,\" and he wrote that, \"Apple would gladly participate in such an effort.\"  </p><p>      So if we have any hope of moving this debate forward, we need all the parties to come to the table, the participation of our witnesses today should serve as a model to those who have been reluctant to participate in this discussion.  We can't move forward if each party remains in its corner, unwilling to compromise or propose solutions.  </p><p>      Both sides need to recognize that this is an effort to strike a balance between the security and privacy of personal data and public safety.  The public needs to feel confident that their information is secure, but at the same time we need to assure them that law enforcement has all the tools it needs to do their jobs effectively.  </p><p>      So Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield the remaining time to the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Clarke.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding.  </p><p>      First, let me welcome Chief Thomas Galati, who is the Chief of Intelligence for my home town of New York City.  And many refer to the New York City Police Department as New York's finest, but I like to think of them as the world's finest.  </p><p>      Welcome, Chief Galati.  </p><p>      At its core, our Constitution is about the balance of power. It's about balancing power among the Federal Government, State Government and the rights of individuals.  Through the years, getting that balance just right has been challenging and at times tension- filled.  But we have done it.  We have prevailed.  </p><p>      The encryption versus privacy rights issue is simply another opportunity for us to, again, recalibrate and fine tune the balance in our democracy.  And as the old cliche states, democracy is not a spectator sport, so it's time for all of us to participate.  </p><p>      It's time to roll up our sleeves and work together to resolve this issue as an imperative, because it's not going away.  So I'm glad that we are having this hearing today, because I do believe that working together, we can find a way to balance our concerns and to address this issue of physical security with our right to private security.  </p><p>      So I look forward to hearing the perspective of our witnesses, the perspectives of our witnesses today and I yield back the remainder of my time.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you, (inaudible) yields back and thank you.  </p><p>      I would -- just to ask unanimous consent that the member's written opening statements be introduced into the record, without objection, the documents will be entered into the record. </p><p>      Now I'd like to introduce the witnesses of our first panel for today's hearing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Our first witness on the panel is Ms. Amy Hess.  Ms. Hess is the Executive Assistant Director for Science and Technology, the Federal Bureau of Investigations in this role.  She's responsible for the Executive Oversight of the Criminal Justice Information Services Laboratory and Operational Technology divisions.  Ms. Hess has logged time in the field as an FBI special agent, as well as the bureau's headquarters here in Washington, D.C.  And we thank Ms. Hess for preparing her testimony and look forward to hearing your insights in these matters.  </p><p>      We also want to welcome Chief Thomas Galati, from the New York City Police Department.  Chief Galati is a 32-year veteran of the New York City Police Department, and currently serves as the chief of intelligence.  </p><p>      As chief of intelligence, he is responsible for the activities of the intelligence bureau, the western hemisphere's largest municipal law enforcement intelligence operation.  </p><p>      Thank you, Chief Galati, for your testimony today and we look forward to hear your comments.  </p><p>      And finally for the first panel, we welcome Captain Charles Cohen, of the Indiana State Police.  Currently he is the commander of the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Technologies, where he is responsible for the cyber crime, electronic surveillance and internet crimes against children.  </p><p>      We appreciate his time today and once again thank all the witnesses for being here.  Also want to note, Sheriff Ron Hickman of the Harris County Sheriff's Office will not be joining us today due to the tragic flooding yesterday in the Houston area.  Our prayers and thoughts are with the people of Houston.  We know there have been several tragedies there.  We all wish Sheriff Hickman could be with us but we understand travel logistics can sometimes make these things impossible.  </p><p>      I would ask unanimous consent, however, that Sheriff Hickman's testimony be entered into the record.  And without objection that his testimony will be entered into the record.  </p><p>      Now to our panelists.  As you are aware, the committee is holding investigative hearing and when doing so, has the practice of taking testimony under oath.  Do any of you have any objections to taking testimony under oath? </p><p>      All say no.  The chairman advises you under the rules of the House and rules of the committee you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do any of you desire to be advised by counsel during the hearing today?  All say no as well.  In that case, would you raise your right hand, I'll swear you in.  </p><p>      Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?  </p><p>      Thank you.  You may be seated.  </p><p>      All the witnesses answered in the affirmative.  You are under oath and subject to the penalties of Title 18 Section 1001 of the United States Code.  You may now give a five-minute summary of your opening statement.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess you're recognized for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Just make sure your microphone is pulled as close to you as possible.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir -- and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and engage in this important discussion.  In recent years, we've seen new technologies transform our society most notably by enabling digital communications and facilitating e-commerce.  It's essential that we protect these communication, to promote free expression, secure commerce and trade, and safeguard sensitive information.  We support strong encryption.  </p><p>      But we have seen how criminals, including terrorists are using advances in technology to their advantage.  Encryption is not the only challenge we face in today's technological landscape, however.  We face significant obstacles in lawfully tracking suspects, because they can seamlessly communicate while changing from a known WiFi service, to a cellular connection to a WiFi hotspot.  They can move from one communication application to another and carry the same conversation or multiple conversations simultaneously.  </p><p>      Communication companies do not have standard data rate policies or guidelines, and without historical data, it's very difficult to put pieces of the investigative puzzle together.  Some foreign communication providers have millions of users in the United States, but no point of presence here, making it difficult, if not impossible to execute a lawful court order.  We encounter platforms that render suspects virtually anonymous on the internet and if we can not attribute communications and actions to a specific individual, critical leads and evidence may be lost.  The problem is exponentially increased when we face one or more of these challenges on top of one another.  </p><p>      Since our nation's inception we've had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  This means that only with probable cause and a court order can law enforcement listen to an individual's private conversation or enter their private spaces.  </p><p>      But when changes in technology hinder or prohibit our ability to use authorized investigative tools, and follow critical leads we may not be able to root out child predators hiding in the shadows or violent criminals targeting our neighborhoods.  We may not be able to identify and stop terrorists who are using today's communication platforms to plan and execute attacks in our country.  </p><p>      So we're in this quandary, trying to maximize security as we move into a world where increasingly information is beyond the reach of judicial authority and trying to maximize privacy, in the era of rapid technological advancement.  </p><p>      Finding the right balance is a complex endeavor and should not be left solely to corporations or to the FBI to solve.  It must be publicly debated and deliberated.  The American people should decide how we want to govern ourselves in today's world.  </p><p>      It's law enforcement's responsibility to inform the American people that the investigative tools we've successfully used in the past are increasingly becoming less effective.  The discussion so far has been highly charged at times because people are passionate about privacy and security but this is an essentially discussion which must include a productive, meaningful and rational dialogue, on how encryption as currently implemented poses significant barriers for law enforcement's ability to do its job.  </p><p>      As this the discussion continues, we're fully committed to working with industry, academia and other parties to develop the right solution.  We have an obligation to ensure everyone understands the public safety and national security risks that is result from the use of new technologies and encrypted platforms by malicious actors.  </p><p>      To be clear we're not asking to expand the government's surveillance authority, but rather to ensure we can continue to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that the Congress that is provided us to keep America safe.  </p><p>      There is not and will not be a one-size-fits-all solution to address the variety of challenges we face.  The FBI is pursuing multiple avenues to over come these challenges  but we realize we cannot overcome them on our own.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, we believe the issues posed by this growing problem are grave and extremely complex.  We must therefore continue the public discourse on how best to ensure that privacy and security can coexist and reinforce each other, and this hearing today is a vital part of that process.  </p><p>      Thank you again for your time and attention to this important matter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Hess.  Now I recognize Chief Galati for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Thank you. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Make sure your microphone is on, and pull it as close to you as you can.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      On behalf of Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton and myself, thanks to the committee for the opportunity to speak with you this morning.  Years ago criminals and their accomplices stored their information in closets, drawers, safes and glove boxes.  There was and continues to be an expectation of privacy in these areas, but the high burden imposed by the Fourth Amendment, which requires lawful search be warranted and authorized by a neutral judge has been deemed sufficient protection against unreasonable government search and seizure for the past 224 years.  </p><p>      But now it seems that that legal authority is struggling to catch up with the times.  Because today, nearly everyone lives their life on a smart phone, including criminals so evidence that once would be stored in a file cabinet or a notebook is now archived in an e-mail or a text message.  The same exact information that would solved a murder, catch a rapist, or prevent a mass shooting is now stored in that device.  </p><p>      But where law enforcement has legal access to the file cabinet, it is shut out of the phone, not because of the constraints built into the law, about you rather limits imposed by technology.  When law enforcement is unable to access evidence necessary to the investigation, prosecution and prevention of a crime despite the lawful right to do so, we call this going dark.  </p><p>      Every day we deal with this evidentiary dilemma on two fronts. First, is what is known as data at rest.  This is when the actual device, the computer, the tablet or the phone is in law enforcement's possession, but the information stored within it is inaccessible.  </p><p>      In just a six-month period from October 2015 through March of this year, New York City has been locked out of 67 Apple devices lawfully seized pursuant to the investigation of 44 violent crimes, in addition there are 35 non-Apple devices.  Of the Apple devices these incidents include 23 felonies, 10 homicides, two rapes and two police officers shot in the line of duty.  </p><p>      They include robberies, criminal weapons possession, criminal sex acts and felony assaults. In every case, we have the file cabinet, so to speak, and the legal authority to open it, but we lack the technical ability to do so because of the encryption protects its contents. But in every case these crimes deserve our protection, too.  </p><p>      The second type of going dark is an incident known as data in motion.  In these cases, law enforcement is legally permitted through a warrant or other judicial process to intercept and access a suspect's communication.  But the encryptions built into the applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Wickr and others thwart this type of lawful surveillance. So, we may know a criminal group is communicating, but we are unable to understand why.  In the past, a phone or a wiretap, again legally obtained from a judge, would alert the police officer to drop off locations, hideouts and target locations.  Now we are literally in the dark, and criminals know it, too.  </p><p>      We recently heard a defendant in a serious felony case make a call from Rikers Island where he extolled the Apple IOS 8 and the encryption software as a gift from God. This leaves the police, prosecutors and people were sworn to protect in a precarious position. What is even more alarming, is that the position is not dictated by our elected officials or our judiciary system or our laws.  </p><p>      Instead it has created and controlled by corporations like Apple and Google who have taken it upon themselves to decide who can access critical information in criminal investigations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  As a bureau chief in our nation's largest municipal police department, an agency that's charged with protecting 8.5 million residents and millions of (inaudible) computers and tourists everyday, I'm confident that corporate CEOs do not hold themselves to the same safety standards as our elected officials and law enforcement professionals.  </p><p>      So, how do we keep people safe?  The answer cannot be warrant- proof encryption, which creates a landscape of criminal information outside the reach of search warrants or a subpoena, and outside legal authority to establish over centuries of jurisprudence.  But this has not always been Apple's answer.  </p><p>      Until 19 months ago, they held the key that could override protections and open phones.  Apple used this master key to comply with court orders in kidnappings, murders and terrorism cases.  There was no documented incident or a code getting out to hackers or government.  If they were able to comply constitutionally, legally -- court orders, then why not now?  </p><p>      Ramifications to this fight extends far beyond San Bernardino, California, and the 14 people murdered there.  It is important to recognize that more than 90 percent of all criminal prosecutions in our country are handled at the state or local level.  These cases involve real people.  Families, your friends, your loved ones.  They deserve police departments that are able to do everything within the law to bring them to justice, and they deserve corporations to appreciate their ethical responsibilities.  </p><p>      I applaud you for holding this hearing today.  It is critical that we work together and across silos to fight crime and disorder, because criminals are not bound by jurisdictional boundaries or industry standards, but increasingly, they are aware of the safety net that the warrant-proof encryption provides them.  And we must all take responsibility for what that means.  </p><p>      For the New York City Police Department, it means investing more in people's lives than in quarterly earnings reports, and putting public safety back into the hands of the brave men and women who have sworn to defend it.  </p><p>      Thank you, and I will take any questions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Chief.  Now, Captain Cohen, you are recognized for five minutes.  Again, pull the microphone close to you. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, thank you for allowing me to testify.  My name is Chuck Cohen, and I'm a captain with the Indiana State Police.  I also serve as Indiana internet crimes against children task force commander.  </p><p>      I would not be here for today if were not for encountering serious problems associated with encryption that do not have easy technological fixes.  We need your help, and it's increasingly apparent that that help must be legislative.  As far as I know, the FBI is not exaggerating or trying to mislead anyone when they say there's currently no way to recover data from newer iPhones.  </p><p>      Apple has intentionally designed an operating system and device combination that functionally acts as a locked container without a key.  The sensitivity of the personal information people keep stored in their phones should be compared with the sensitivity of information that people keep in bank deposit boxes and bedrooms.  </p><p>      Criminal investigators with proper legal authorization have the technical means to access both deposit boxes and bedrooms, but we lack the technical means to access newer cellular phones running default, hard encryption.  </p><p>      We are often asked, for example, of how encryption hinders law enforcement's ability to conduct criminal investigations.  There are numerous encrypted phones sitting in the Indiana State Police's evidence rooms waiting for a solution, legal or technical, to the problem.  </p><p>      Some of those phones belong to murder victims and child sex crimes victims.  Earlier this year, a mother and son were shot to death inside the home in Indiana.  Both victims had newer iPhones. I'm confident that if they were able, both would give consent for us to forensically examine their phones to help us find their killer or killers.  </p><p>      But unfortunately being deceased, they're unable to give consent and unfortunately for investigators working to solve their murders, they chose to buy phones running encrypted operating systems by default.  </p><p>      I need to emphasize that we are talking about not just suspects' phones, but also victims' phones, and not just about incriminating evidence, but also exculpatory evidence that cannot be recovered.  It is always difficult to know what evidence and contraband is not being recovered.  </p><p>      The child victims that are not being rescued, and the child sex offenders that are not being arrested as a result of encryption.  But the investigation, prosecution and federal conviction of Randall R. Fletcher (ph) helps to shed light on the type of evidence that is being concealed by encryption.  </p><p>      Fletcher lived in Northern Indiana.  During the course of an investigation for production and possession of child pornography, computer hard drives with encrypted partitions and encrypted thumb drive were seized.  The encryption was robust, such that it was not possible to forensically examine the encrypted data despite numerous attempts by several law enforcement agencies.  </p><p>      A federal judge compelled Fletcher to disclose the encryption key.  He then provided law enforcement with a passcode that opened the encrypted partitions, but not the encrypted thumb drive.  </p><p>      In the newly opened data, law enforcement found thousands of images and videos depicting minors being caused to engage in sexually explicit conduct.  To this day, investigators believe the thumb drive contains home-made pornography produced by Fletcher, but have no way of confirming or disproving that belief.  </p><p>      Fletcher had continuing and ongoing access to children, including a child he had previously photographed in lascivious poses.  Fletcher has previous convictions for conspiracy to commit murder and child sex offenses that are detailed in my written testimony.  There's good reason to believe  that because of hard encryption on the USB storage device, additional crimes committed by Fletcher cannot be investigated and prosecuted.  </p><p>      That means additional child victims cannot be provided victim services or access to the justice they so richly deserve.  </p><p>      I hope that Congress takes time to truly understand what is at stake with the going dark phenomenon, and what problems have been created.  There's a cost associated with an encryption scheme that allows unlawful access with some theoretically higher chance of lost data.  But there is a much greater and very real human cost that we already see across the country, because investigations that fail due to default hard encryption.  </p><p>      In my daily work, I feel the impact of law enforcement going dark.  For me, it is a strong feeling of frustration, because it makes the detectives and forensics examiners, for whom I am responsible, less effective.  But for crime victims and the families, it is altogether different.  </p><p>      It is infuriating, unfair, and incomprehensible why such critical information for solving crimes should be allowed to be completely out of reach.  </p><p>      I have heard some say that law enforcement can solve crimes using metadata alone.  That is simply not true.  That's like asking a detective to process a crime scene by only looking at the street address on the outside of the house where a crime was committed.  </p><p>      I strongly encourage committee members to contact your state investigative agency or local police department and ask about this challenge.  I greatly appreciate your invitation to share my perspective, and I am happy to answer questions today or at any point in the future.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I thank the panel.  I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess, I think sometimes the FBI's concerns about encryption are broadly characterized as being against encryption.  Considering the FBI's work on investigations like the Sony data breach, or recent (inaudible) attacks on hospitals, I have a tough time believing that your organization is against the technology that is so instrumental in protecting digital information.  </p><p>      So to clarify, does the FBI agree that strong encryption is important to the security and privacy of our citizens, or economic strength and our national security?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And also benefits law enforcement.  Yes, can you elaborate on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  Yes, and you are correct.  Is that, as I stated in my opening statement, we do support strong encryption, because it does all of the things you just said.  </p><p>      We also recognize that we have a continuing struggle and an increasing struggle to access readable information, to access content of communications caused by that encryption that is now in place by default.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And so, it brings this question up then, are you witnessing an increase in individuals intentionally or even unintentionally evading the law through availability of default encryption?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I think it's difficult to discern whether or not they're intentionally doing it.  However, we -- we are significantly seeing increases in the use and deployment of decryption, because it is a default setting now on most devices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  So, related to that, then, Chief Galati, would you say that  default of encryption can create significant hurdles for law enforcement, is that the issue, as Ms. Hess was just saying, is it the default one?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  The encryption, a lot of the apps that are being used today, even with legal process or, you know, coverage on the phone, you cannot intercept those conversations.  </p><p>      Often, we hear criminals, both criminals and also in the terrorism cases that we do, people encouraging participants to go to apps like Telegram, Whatsapp, Wickr and so on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  You know, Captain Cohen, your testimony was very moving about those cases you described, people involved with murder and with victimizing children.  </p><p>      You know, this debate has oftentimes been about picking sides, the most notable being Apple v. the FBI.  So either you support law enforcement or you support the tech community. </p><p>      That feels like a loser's proposition.  Look, I understand people want to be able to have encrypted technology, but based upon the responses, Chief that you -- Captain, that you heard from Ms. Hess and from the chief, do you think this is an us versus them debate?  </p><p>      Are there answers that we could be going for here?  What do you think?  Because you are on the front lines dealing with these terrible cases, that -- is this an us/them?  Is there an answer?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I definitely do not think it's an us/them. What we do see, though, is a challenge with default encryption that functionally cannot be turned off.  </p><p>      I mean, I don't have the option to even disable that encryption. The difference is Mr. Fletcher, the example I gave you, was that after two prior convictions, he then learned that he needed to do something to protect himself better from criminal investigation, and then went out in search of, we assume, encryption and ways to do that.  </p><p>      The difference is now, what we are seeing increasingly -- to talk to your question to Ms. Hess as well, what we are seeing now is discussion among wide variety of criminals, and I see it daily, discussion among those that sexually solicit children online, sexually extort children, trade in child pornography, discussing the best possible systems to buy, the best combination of cell phone and operating system to buy, to prevent encryption.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Please make no mistake that criminals are listening to this testimony and learning from it.  They're learning which messaging app to use to protect themselves against encryption.  They're also learning which messaging app is located outside the United States and has no bricks and mortar location here in the United States, which ones are located in countries with which we have a mutual, legal system (ph) and which ones we don't.  </p><p>      Criminals are using this as an education to make themselves more effective at the criminal trade craft.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  So given that, Ms. Hess, what answer will we have here, for those cases whether it's a terrorist planning a plot or they have already killed some people and we're trying to find out what the next move is?  Or it is a child predator?  Will there be an answer for this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  And to clarify my earlier statement, too, we do see individuals, criminals, terrorists encouraging others to move to encrypted platforms, and we've seen that for some time.  And the solution to that, for us, is no investigator, no agent will take that as an answer to say that they should stop investigating.  </p><p>      They will try to find whatever workaround they possibly can, but those solutions may be time intensive.  They may not eventually be effective.  They may require an additional amount of resources or an additional amount of skill in order to get to those solutions.  </p><p>      But primarily, we are in -- usually -- a race against the clock, and that's the key component of how we're finding additional solutions around this problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I know this is a frightening aspect for Americans, we understand privacy, but if there is some child predator hiding in the bushes by the playground, watching to snatch a victim, you can find them.  But now that this has given this cloak of invisibility, it's pretty frightening.  We better find an answer.  My time is up.  </p><p>      I now recognize Ms. DeGette, for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Well, just a follow-up on the Chairman's questioning, the problem really isn't default encryption, because -- because -- if -- if you eliminated default encryption, criminals could still get encryption and they do.  Isn't that correct, Ms. Hess? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, that's correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Right, so the problem is that criminals can have easy access to encryption, so -- and I think we can stipulate that encryption is really great for people like me who have bank accounts who don't want them to be hacked, but it's just really a horrible challenge for all of us as a society not just law enforcement, when you have a child sex predator who's trying to encrypt or just as bad really, a terrorist.  </p><p>      So what I want to know is, what are we going to do about it?  And the industry says that if -- if Congress forces them to develop tools so that law enforcement with probable cause and a warrant can get access to that data, that then will just open the door.  Do you believe that's true, Ms. Hess?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I believe that, there certainly will be always, no such thing as a hundred percent security.  However, industry leaders today have built systems that enable us to be able to get or receive readable content.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And Chief Galati, what's your view on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I believe that in order to provide -- and I don't want to call it a back door, but rather a front door, I think if the companies can provide law enforcement, I don't believe that it would be abused...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Why not?  Why not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  We have the CALEA Law from '94 and that was not abused, so I don't see how by making a law...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  What they're saying is the technology, once they developed that technology then, anybody could get access to it and they could break the encryption.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I believe that if we look at Apple, they had the technology going back to about 18, 19 months ago, where they were doing it for law enforcement, and I am not aware of any cases of abuse that came out when Apple did actually did have the key, so I can see if that they still have the key today, they hold it/  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  I'll ask them that,, because they're coming up.  </p><p>      Captain Cohen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I think it might be helpful to look for real-world analogies.  If you think of an iPhone or an Android OS phone as a safety-deposit box, the key the bank holds, that's the private key encryption, the key the customer holds, that's the public key encryption.  </p><p>      But what the bank does is it builds fire walls around that. There's a difference between encryption and fire walls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And you think that technology exists?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  The technology does exist. So when we're...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of time but I'm going to ask them the same question.  Now, there's something else that can be done; forcing the industry to comply or like in the San Bernardino case, the FBI hired a third-party to help them break the code in that phone, and that was what we call gray hats.  People who are sort of in this murky market.  What do you think about that suggestion, Ms. Hess?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  That certainly is one potential solution, but that takes me back to the prior answer, which is that these solutions are case-by-case specific, they may not work in all instances. They're very dependent upon the fragility of the systems or as we might find.  </p><p>       And also, they're very time intensive and resource intensive, which may not be scalable to enable us to be successful in our investigation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Do you think there's any ethical issue with using these third-party hackers to do this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I think that certainly there are vulnerabilities that we should review to make sure that we identify the risks and benefits of being able to exploit those vulnerabilities in a greater setting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  I understand you're doing it because you have to in certain cases.  Do you think it's a good policy to follow?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I do not think that that should be the solution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And one more question is, if third-party individuals can develop these techniques to get into these encrypted devices or programs, why can't we bring more capabilities in-house to the government to be able to do that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Certainly these types of solutions, and as I said this should not be the only solution, but these types of solutions that we do employ and can employ, they require a lot of highly skilled specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Can we develop those with the right resources?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  No, ma'am, I don't see that possible.  I think that we really need the cooperation of industry, we need the cooperation of academia, we need the cooperation of the private sector in order to come up with solutions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Gentlewoman's time's now expired (ph).  </p><p>      I now recognize the gentlelady from Indiana, Ms. Brooks, for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      In 2001, after I was appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern district of Indiana, I began work with the Indiana Crimes Against Children Task Force, which was led primarily by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve DeBrota, working hand-in-hand with you, Captain Cohen.  </p><p>       I want to thank you so much for being here.  Because prior to that time, I would say that I was certainly not aware about what really went into and what horrific crimes really were being perpetrated against children back at that time in 2001, 2002.  </p><p>      And when we talk about child exploitation against children, we need to realize this involves babies up to teenagers.  This is not all about just willing teenagers doing these times of -- being involved in these types of acts.  These are people preying on children of all ages.  </p><p>      And I want to walk you through, Captain Cohen, what some of the impediments are, a bit more about how this on works, how you are being thwarted in your investigations and also want to wrap up and make sure we have time for you to explain your thoughts about the fire walls.  </p><p>      First of all, if you could just please walk through with us, offenders -- and I'm talking about older children, now -- older kids who have access to social media.  Offenders, perpetrators are making connections through social media platforms, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And are those are typically unencrypted or encrypted?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Two years ago, I would've said typically unencrypted, now typically encrypted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  OK and I left my service as U.S. attorney in '07, so things, I think, have changed pretty  dramatically.  Then, in the second step, the conversation moves to encrypted discussions, would that be correct?  They encourage particularly young people to go to apps like WhatsApp, Kik and others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Correct, they'll generally go trolling for a potential victim in an unencrypted app.  Once they think they have a victim they think that they can perpetrate against, then they'll move to an encrypted communication app.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And then, would it be fair to say that through the relationship that's been developed, they typically encourage them to send an image?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Correct, they want that victim to do one compromising act that they can then exploit.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And that image is sent typically from one smart phone to another or from one smart phone to a computer? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Generally, from one smart phone to another, in the United Stated involving an Android phone or an iPhone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And then those -- but this doesn't just happen in our country, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Correct, it's possible like never before for someone even in another country to victimize a child in the U.S.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And in fact, so we have out-of-country perpetrators, as well as in-country perpetrators focusing on even out-of-country victims, as well.  Is that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Correct, ma'am, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And then are those typically encrypted?  The transmission of those photos are typically encrypted?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes, that's one of our challenges. The transmission is encrypted, as well as when the data sits at rest on the phones it's encrypted there as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And you presenting that image to a jury if an individual is caught and needs -- and is prosecuted, it is imperative, is it not, for you to present the actual image to a jury?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am. The metadata alone, who was talking with whom, doesn't matter. It's the content of the communication.  It's the images that were sent and received.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  So if you can't get these encrypted images and the encrypted discussions, what do you have in court?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  We have nothing in court.  We can't complete the investigation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  How do you find the victims?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Oftentimes we don't have way of identifying the victims. They go unserved.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And can you please talk to us a bit more about why -- what it is that you actually do to find the victims.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  We do everything we can.  We try to look for legal solutions, meaning trying to get records from (inaudible) service providers from the technology companies, trying to identify them through that.  The challenge we encounter there many times, as Ms. Hess mentioned, is because of retention periods, the records no longer exist, the metadata no longer exists. And then we try to get the content and the communication to show who was talking with whom and oftentimes we're unable to do that because of encryption.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And isn't it pretty common that when you find one of these phones or a computer or a perpetrator, there are usually thousands of images involving multiple victims?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Thousands or hundreds of thousands. An increase (ph) (inaudible) find those also in encrypted cloud storage sites like Dropbox and Google Drive and One Drive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And could you please just expand a little bit on what was -- you previously started to answer -- potential solution with respect to fire walls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  A potential solution is to provide a better fire wall. Think of it as a vault door where the safety deposit box is. Think of that as the doors to the bank.  So while you think of the actual locks on the bank deposit boxes as the encryption, you build fire walls around that.  </p><p>      Those fire walls can, with legal process, be opened up. You can go inside it.  But just like a safety deposit box, if we go to the bank with a search warrant, the bank uses their key, we get a drill and we drill the customer's lock and we see what's inside the safety deposit box. I've done that dozens of times in the course of my career. The difference is with encryption, my drill doesn't break the lock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  Thank you, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  (inaudible) yields back.  </p><p>      Now I'll recognize Ms. Clarke for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our ranking member.   </p><p>      In October of 2014, FBI Director Comey gave these remarks on encryption before the Brookings Institute. \"We in the FBI will continue to throw every lawful tool we have at this problem. But it's costly.  It's inefficient and it takes time.  We need to fix this problem.  It is long past time.  We need assistance and cooperation from companies to comply with lawful court orders so that criminals around the world cannot seek safe haven for lawless conduct. We need to find common ground and we care about the same things.\"  </p><p>      So, Ms. Hess, I'd like to ask this question of you. Other than tech companies creating back doors for law enforcement, what do you believe are some possible solutions to address the impasse between law enforcement's need to lawfully gain access to critical information and the cybersecurity benefits of strong encryption?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  And as previously stated, I really believe that certain industry leaders have created secure systems that they are still yet able to comply with lawful orders.  They're still able to access the contents to either -- of those communications -- to either provide some protection for their customers against malicious software or some other types of articles. In addition to that, they're able to do it, perhaps, for business purposes or for banking regulations, for example.  </p><p>      In addition to those solutions, we certainly don't stop there. We look at any possible tools we might have in our tool box.  And that might include the things we previously discussed here today.  Whether that be individual solutions, metadata , whether it could be an increase in physical surveillance. But each of those things comes at a cost and all of those things are not as responsive as being able to get the information directly from the provider.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  So do you believe that there is some common ground?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  To the other panelists, are there solutions that you can see that might solve this impasse?  </p><p>      The solution that we had in place previously in which Apple, as an example, did hold a key.  And as Chief Galati mentioned, that was never compromised.  So they could comply with the proper service of legal process. Essentially what happened in this instance is Apple solved a problem that does not exist.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I would say by Apple or other industries holding the key, it reduces at least the law enforcement having to go outside of those companies to find people that can get a solution.  So as mentioned earlier about the gray hat hackers, you know, they're going to be out there.  But if the companies are doing it, it reduces the risk, I believe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  Very well.  In the San Bernardino case, press accounts indicate that the FBI has used the services of private sector third parties to work around the encryption of the iPhone in question.  This case raises important questions about whether we want law enforcement using non-governmental third party entities to circumvent security features developed by private companies.  </p><p>      So I have questions about whether this is a good model or whether a better model exists.  Mr. Hess, assuming press accounts are true and you procured the help of a third party to gain access to that iPhone, why were you apparently not able to solve this problem on your own?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  For one thing, as previously discussed, technology is changing very rapidly.  We live in such an advanced age of technology development.  And to keep up with that, we do require the services of specialized skills that we can only get through private industry.  And that partnership is critical to our success.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  So this is to the entire panel.  Do you believe that the U.S. government needs enhanced technological capabilities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I think it does.  Private industry provides a lot of opportunities.  So I think the best people that are out there are working for private companies and not working for the government.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  Okay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I agree with the chief.  Essentially we need the help of private industry, both the industry that makes the technology and others.  We need industry to act as good corporate citizens and help us because we can't do it alone.  </p><p>      There are over 18,000 police agencies in the United States.  And while the FBI may have some technical ability internally, those other agencies do not.  And as the chief mentioned, over 90 percent of all the investigations are handled at the state and local level.  We need industry's help.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARKE</emphasis>:  Very well.  I'll yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  (inaudible) yields back and now, recognize Mr. Griffith for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  Thank you all for being here for this important discussion that we're having today.  I will tell you, we have to figure out what the balance is both from a security standpoint, but also to make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations under our Constitution, which was written with real-life circumstances in mind. Where they said we don't want the government being able to come in and get everything.  They were aware of the situation with general warrants, both in London, used against John Wilkes and the Wilkes (inaudible) rebellion and the Founding Fathers were also aware of James Otis and his fight in Massachusetts, which John Adams said sewed the seeds of the Revolution when the British government wanted to go from warehouse to warehouse looking for smuggled goods. So it's not an easy situation.  </p><p>      I do have this question, though.  Apparently some researchers recently published the results of a survey of over 600 encrypted products that are available online.  And basically they found that about two-thirds of them are foreign products.  So the question would be, given that so many of the encrypted products could, in fact, be from companies not located or headquartered within the United States of America.  </p><p>      If we force the companies that we do have jurisdiction over to weaken the security of their products, are we doing little more than hurting American industry and then sending the really bad actors like Mr. Fletcher, who is the child pornographer, just to a different format that we don't have control over?  That's one question that I would ask all three of you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Right now, Google and Apple act as the gatekeepers for most of those encrypted apps.  Meaning if the app is not available on the app store for an iOS device, if the app was not available in Google Play for an Android OS device, a customer in the United States cannot install it.  So while some of the encrypted apps like Telegram are based outside the United States,  U.S. companies act as the gatekeepers as to whether those apps are accessible here in the United States to be used.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p>      Chief?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I would agree exactly what the captain said.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  And, you know, certain apps are not available on all devices.  So if the companies that are outside the United States can't comply with the same rules and regulations of the -- the ones that are in the United States then they shouldn't be available on the app stores.  </p><p>      For example, you can't get every app on a BlackBerry you can on an Android or Google.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir, what you stated is correct.  </p><p>      I think that certainly we need to examine how other countries are viewing the same problem.  They have the same challenges as we speak and are having similar deliberations as to how their law enforcement might gain access to these communications as well.  As we move toward that, the question is what makes consumers want to buy American products? Is it because they're more secure or because they actually cover the types of services that the consumers desire?  Is it just because of personal preference?  At the same time, we need to make sure that we balance that security as well as the privacy that the consumers have come to expect.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>      Captain Cohen, I am curious, you talked about the Fletcher case and indicated that the judge ordered he give the password to the computer but then you didn't get access to the thumb drive.  Was the judge asked to force him to do that as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  The judge -- in that instance the judge compelled him to provide it.  He said, \"it was not encrypted,\" the thumb drive was not encrypted.  His defense expert disagreed and said, \"it was encrypted.\" He then provided a password and failed a stipulated polygraph as to whether he knew the password and failed to disclose it.  So every indication is he intentionally chose to not give the second password for that device.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  And was he held in contempt for that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Not that -- I do not believe he was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p>      I mean, look, obviously, if you can get the images you have better chance of finding the victim.  It's true though before encryption there was great difficulty in finding victims even if you found a store of photographs in a filing cabinet.  It was sometimes hard to track down the victims, isn't that correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  It's always very difficult to find child victims.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  It is.  It's a shame.  </p><p>      I like the concept -- the visual of you're able to drill into the safety deposit box but you can't get into an encrypted telephone or computer.  Is there a product out there that would be that limited because one of the things I know Apple has had they don't want a back door to every single phone that other folks can get a hold of, or that the government could use at will, particularly governments maybe not as conscious of civil liberties as the United States.  Do you know of any such a product that would give you that specificity?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Again, the specificity would be similar to what we had prior to Apple changing where the encryption key is kept.  </p><p>      The legal process served on Apple as an example, and Apple is the one to use the drill, not law enforcement.  That helps provide another layer of protection against abuses by governments other than ours, meaning, while they have that capability because they're inside the fire wall, those outside the fire wall -- outside the vault would have no ability to get access.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  I appreciate it.  I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  The gentleman yields back.  I now recognize Mr. WELCH for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WELCH</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      First of all, I want to thank each of you for the work you and your departments do.  It's astonishing times when the kind of crimes that all America is exposed to are happening and the expectation on the part of the public is somehow some way you're going to make it right, you're going to make us safe.  So I think all of us really appreciate your work.  </p><p>      This issue as you've acknowledged is very difficult.  I think if any of us were in your position what we would want is access to any information that the Fourth Amendment allowed us to get in order for us to do our job.  But there's three issues that are really difficult. One is law enforcement issue that you've very clearly enunciated.  You have probable cause, you go through the process of getting a warrant. You're entitled to information that's on the phone or in the house, because of the technology we have impediments to you getting what you're legally authorized to get.  I think we want you to be able to get the information you rightfully can obtain.  </p><p>      The second issue that makes it unique almost is that in order for you to get the information, you have to get the active participation of an innocent third party who had nothing to do with the events but who potentially can get the information for you.  That's the whole Apple case.  But it's not -- very complicated situation because it's not as though if you came with a warrant to my house for me to turn over information I had. </p><p>      It's one thing if I go in my drawer and give it to you, it's another thing if it's buried deep in the back yard and the order is I've got to buy a back hoe or rent a back hoe and go out there and start digging around until I find it.  Normally that would be the burden on the law enforcement agency.  So that's the second issue, how much can the government require a third party, a company or an individual to actually use their own resources to assist in getting access to the information?  </p><p>      And then the third issue that's really tough, as Mr. Griffith was just acknowledging.  we get a back door key, we trust you, but we have other governments our businesses are doing business with and they get pressured to provide the back door key, the key is lost and then things happen with respect to privacy and security that you don't want to happen and that we don't want to happen.  This is a genuinely tough situation where frankly I'm not sure there's a quote, \"easy balance\" on this.  </p><p>      So just a couple of questions.  Ms.  Hess, what do you see as the answer here if -- I know you want the information but if the getting of the information requires me to hire a few people to work in the yard with a back hoe or apple to really deploy high cost engineers to come up with a entry key?  Are you saying that's what should be required now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir I think the best solution is for us to work cooperatively  with technology with industry, and with academia to try to come up with the best possible solution.  However, no investigative agency should forego that for all other solutions, they should continue to drive forward with all solutions available.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WELCH</emphasis>:  Chief, I'll ask you.  </p><p>      I mean, you are on the front line in New York all the time.  And is it your view that the right policy now would be for you when you have probable cause to protect us and, you know, we're all on the same page there, to force a technology company at significant effort and expense to assist in getting access to the information?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Sir, I would say up until a couple years ago, most of the technology companies, and they still do, have law enforcement liaisons we work closely with.  For example, if it's Facebook or Google or even Apple, where you know, we have the ability to go to them with legal process and they're providing us with the search warrant.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WELCH</emphasis>:  Right.  My understanding from talking to those folks is that if it's information like that's stored in the cloud -- this is a situation in San Bernardino.  There was a lot of stuff that was relatively easy to retrieve and they do provide that.  They do cooperate as long as you have the warrant, they do everything they can to accommodate those lawful requests from law enforcement.  Has that been your experience?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Yes, the cloud does have some issues because things can be deleted from the cloud and never recovered.  If the phone is not uploaded to the cloud, things are lost.  There's a very...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WELCH</emphasis>:  Would you just acknowledge there's a significant distinction between a company turning over information that's easily retrievable in the cloud comparable to me going to my house and opening a drawer and giving you the information you requested, versus a company that has to have engineers try to somehow crack the code so that they're very energetically involved in the process of decryption? That's the difference, you would agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Yes, it's a difference.  </p><p>      I believe when they create the operating system, that's where they have to make that key available.  So that they don't have to spend the resources to crack a code but rather have a new operating system that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WELCH</emphasis>:  Thanks.  Just one last thing  -by the way, thank you -- I'm over?  </p><p>      All right, I just want to say I thought what Representative Clark said, \"about resources for you to let you do some of this work on your own,\" makes an awful lot of sense.  Some of these conflicts are going to be frankly as much as we want to say they're resolvable, they're hard to resolve.  </p><p>      I'm sorry, thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I now recognize Mr. Mullin for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  As you can see, I think both sides on this -- up here on this -- in this Committee you can see we want to get to the real problem.  We want to be helpful not a hindrance.  Obviously, all of us want to be safe but we want to make sure we operate within a constitution.  </p><p>      The technology is changing at such a pace that know law enforcement has to do their job and staying with it because criminals are doing their job, too.  Like it or not, and if it changes, crimes change, we have to change the way we operate.  The concern is privacy, obviously, and getting into that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Ms. Hess, some have argued that the expansion of connected devices through the internet of things provides law enforcement with new surveillance tools and capabilities.  </p><p>      Recently, the Berkman Center at Harvard University argues that the internet of things could potentially offset the government's inability to access encrypted technology for providing new paths for surveillance and monitoring.  </p><p>      My question is, what's your reaction to the idea that internet of things presents a potential alternative to access encrypted devices?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Certainly, sir, I do think that the internet of things and associated metadata presents us with an additional opportunity to collect information and evidence that will be helpful to us in investigations.  </p><p>      However, those merely provide us with leads or clues, whereas the real contents of the communications is what we really seek in order to prove beyond all reasonable doubt in court in order to get a conviction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Could you expand a little bit on the content to what's in the device?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  The actual content of communication?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Or the conversation that happens between the devices?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  What the people are saying to each other.  As opposed to just who is communicating or at what location they were communicating. It's critically important to law enforcement to know what they said in order to prove intent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Is there something that we on this panel need to be -- I say this panel, this committee, should be looking at to help you be able to gain access to that?  Or since it's connected, does it even take any extra steps for you to build to access that information?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, and exactly to the point of discussion here today, is that we need to work with industry and with academia in order to come up with solutions so that we can access that content or so they can access it and provide it to us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  So is the FBI is exploring options I'm assuming?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  We are, yes, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Are there challenges or concerns using the growth of connected devices that you can see coming down the road, obviously, with the technology changing rapidly today?  What are some of the challenges that you're facing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Certainly as more and more things in today's world become connected.  There's also an increasing demand for encrypting those particular services, those particular devices and capabilities.  And that's well-warranted and well-merited.  </p><p>      But again, it presents a challenge for us as metadata is increasingly encrypted, that presents a challenge for us as well.  We need to be able to access the information, but more importantly, the content.  In other words, if a suspect's toaster is connected to their car so that they know it's going to come on at a certain time, that's helpful.  But it doesn't help us to know the content of the communication when it comes to developing plots.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  So is there a difference between say, the FBI the way you have to operate Captain Cohen and the way that you have to operate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  There's not much of a difference, because quite candidly, we work very well together.  But you ask the initial challenges.  In February Apple announces that it plans to tie the same encryption key to the iCloud account.  So, as an example, the content that's curling (ph) that cloud system iCloud, Apple's announced publicly, they plan to make that encrypted and inaccessible with the service of legal process.  So that's one of the challenges that you asked about, that we're looking at is, we're going to lose that area of content as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  So, I just assume that everything I do online for some intended purpose is out there.  And people are just going to go to retrieve it.  I don't assume any privacy when it's on the internet. Is that analogy -- could that analogy hold up true?  Or should we be expecting a sense of privacy when it's on the internet?  I mean, we put it out there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Sir, I believe we should all expect a sense of privacy on the internet, a sense of privacy when we talk in a restaurant, when we talk on the telephone, landline or cellular.  But that privacy cannot be completely absolute.  We need to have, when we serve proper legal process, a search warrant.  </p><p>      As an example, to have the ability, the constitution protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures, not all search and seizures. So we have our private companies, without checks and balances protecting everyone against all searches.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Chief, do you have an opinion on this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Yes.  I agree also.  You know, on the internet, you have a right to privacy.  And most of these apps and programs give you privacy settings so nobody can get at it.  I think when you get into the criminal world or the malicious, criminal intent, that's when law enforcement has to have the ability to go in and see what you have on there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MULLIN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Mr. Pallone is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I never seem to be amazed at how complex an issue this is.  And it requires balancing various competing values and societal goals.  Yet, much of the debate is focused on simplified versions of the situation that paint it in black and white.  </p><p>      And there seems to be some misunderstanding that we have to either have cybersecurity or no protection online at all.  We've heard that the limitations that encryption places on law enforcement access to information puts us in danger of going dark.  </p><p>      By contrast, we hear the -- heard that the law enforcement now has access to more information than ever.  So-called golden age of surveillance.  At Harvard at the Burkman Center, there was a report titled, \"Don't Panic:  Making Progress on the Going Dark Debate\" that concludes, and I quote, \"The communications of the future will neither be eclipsed into darkness or illuminated without shadow.\"  </p><p>      And I think that's the useful framework to view the issue, not as a binary choice between total darkness or complete illumination, but rather a spectrum.  I think it's fair to say there have been -- there have been and always will be areas of darkness where criminals are able to conceal information.  And no matter what, law enforcement has a tough job.  </p><p>      But the question is how much darkness is too much.  So, I wanted to ask you all -- you know, this is for any of you, about some key questions on the spectrum if you will.  Where are we on this spectrum? Currently, where should we be on the spectrum?  If we're not in the right place, how do we get there.  Let me start with Ms. Hess.  And then, whoever else wants to say something.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  As far as the amount of information we can receive today, I think I -- yes, it is true we do receive more information today than we received in the past.  But I would draw the analogy to the fact that the haystack has gotten bigger but we're still looking for the same needle.  </p><p>      And the challenge for us is to figure out what's important and relevant to the investigation.  We're now we're presented with these volumes -- this volume of information.  And the problem, additionally with that, is that what we are collecting, what we are able to see is, for example, who is communicating with who.  </p><p>      Or potentially, what IP addresses are communicating with each other:  the location, the time, perhaps the duration.  But not the content of what they were actually saying.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  Chief, did you want to add to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I do agree that, you know, the internet has provided a lot more information to police.  That we can go out and we can find public records.  We can find, you know, records within police departments throughout the country.  </p><p>      So to police, the internet has made things a little bit easier. However, the encryption is taking all of those gains away.  And I think the more and more we go towards encryption, the harder it's going to be to really investigate and conduct long term cases.  </p><p>      We do a lot of cases in New York about gangs, drug gangs.  We call them crews.  And it's very vital, all the information that we get from people on the internet, that sometimes are very public out there. But now, they're switching to encrypted and it's making those long term cases -- or I guess call them similar to Rico cases, very, very difficult to put together because we're in the blind.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  All right.  Captain, did you want to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I see that we have a lack of information that I've not seen before in my 20 years of investigations, to being able to do criminal investigations.  Not solely by encryption, but also it relates retention of information and the lack of legislation related to data retention within the internet service providers, similar to what there is to the banking industry, as well as our inability to service legal process on companies that are either located out of the United States or send and store data outside the United States.  </p><p>      I see it as all interrelated issues which together conspire to make it more difficult than ever before for me to gather the information I need to functionally conduct a criminal investigation. So on the spectrum you asked about.  I see it far to the extent of we're losing the ability to access information that we need to rescue victims and solve crimes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I think my second question, I think to some extent you already answered.  But if anybody wants to add to it.  The second question is, where do you see the trend moving?  </p><p>      Are we comfortable with where we're headed, or are the technology trends, such as increasing extraordinary encryption, leaving us with too much darkness?  But, you kind of answered that unless anyone wants to add to what they said.  </p><p>      Yes, Ms.  Hess?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes sir.  I do see that with increasing -- increasingly, technology platforms continue to change and they continue to present challenges for us that I provided in my opening statement.  In addition to that, we try to figure out how we might be able to use what is available to us.  And we are constantly challenged by that as well.  </p><p>      For example, some companies may not know what exactly or how to provide the information we're seeking.  And it's not just a matter of needing that information to enable us to see the content, or enable us to see what people are saying to each other. </p><p>      It's also a matter of being able to figure out who we should be focusing on more quickly so that if we can get that information, we're able to target our investigations more appropriately and be able to exonerate the innocent as well as identifying the guilty.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALLONE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I think I'm going to end with that.  </p><p>      But I just wanted to, you know, ask obviously, that you continue to engage with us to help us answer these questions.  I mean, not just, you know, with what you're saying today.  But, you know, a constant dialogue is what we need.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      I now recognize Dr. Burgess for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURGESS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  And thank you all for being here.  I acknowledge there's another hearing going on upstairs, so if some of us seem to be toggling back and forth, that's exactly what's happening.  </p><p>      Let me just ask you a couple of questions, if could.  There is another subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee called the Commerce Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee, and we're working very closely with the Federal Trade Commission, which is under our jurisdiction of (ph) that subcommittee on the issue of data breach notification and data security.  </p><p>      A component of that effort has been the push for companies to strengthen data security.  One of those ways, perhaps, could be through encryption, and the FTC will look at a company's security protocols for handling data when it reviews whether or not the company is fulfilling its obligations, protecting its customers.  So has the FBI had any discussions with the Federal Trade Commission over whether the back doors or access points might compromise the secured data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  We have engaged in a number -- a number of conversations among the interagency with other agencies, with industry, with academia.  I can get back to you as far as whether we specifically met with the Federal Trade Commission.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURGESS</emphasis>:  That would be helpful, because again, we are actually trying to work through the concept of more in the retail space, but of data security.  Data security is data security, regardless of who is harmed in the process.  Data security is national security writ large. So that would be enormously helpful.  </p><p>      Let me just ask you a question that's probably a little bit off topic, but I can't help myself.  One of the dark sides from encryption is if someone comes in and encrypts your stuff you didn't want it encrypted, and then they won't give it back to you unless you fork over several thousand dollars in bitcoins to them in some dark market. So what is it that the committee needs to understand about that ransomware concept that's going on currently?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  Ransomware is an increasing problem that we're seeing and investigating on a regular basis now.  And I think that certainly, to exercise good cyber-security hygiene is important to be able to back up systems, to have the capability to access that information is important, to be able to talk to each other about what solutions might be available, to be able to fall back to some other type of backup solutions so that you aren't beholden to any particular ransom demands.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURGESS</emphasis>:  And of course, that's critically important.  I'm a physician by background, some of the ransomware has of course occurred in hospitals, medical facilities, and I'll just offer an editorial comment, for what it's worth.  I just cannot imagine going into an ICU some morning and asking to see the data on my patient and being told it's been encrypted by an outside source and you can't have it, doctor.  When you catch those people, I think the appropriate punishment is shot at sunrise and I wouldn't put a lot of appeals between the action and the reaction.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I recognize Mr. Yarmuth for five minutes.  </p><p>      Yazidi:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thanks to the witnesses for your testimony.  I find it hard to come up with any question that is going to elicit any new answers from you.  And I think that the -- your testimony and the discussion that we've had today is an indication of how difficult this situation is.  </p><p>      It sounds to me like there's a great business opportunity here somewhere, but probably you don't have the budgets to pay a business what they would need to be paid to get the information that you're after.  So that may be not such a good business opportunity after all.  </p><p>      I do want to ask one question of you, Ms. Hess.  In your budget request for fiscal year '17, you request more than $38 million to deal with the going dark issue.  And your request also says that it's non- personnel.  So it seems to me that personnel has to be a huge part of this -- this effort, so could you elaborate on what your request -- budget request involves and what you plan to do with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  At a higher level, essentially we're looking for any possible solutions, any possible tools we might be able to throw at the problem, all the different challenges that we encounter, and whether that's giving us the ability to be better password guessers or whether that's the ability to try to develop solutions where we might be able to perhaps exploit some type of vulnerability or maybe that's perhaps a tool where we might be able to make better use of metadata.  All of those things go into that request so that we can try to come up solutions to get around the problem we're currently discussing. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YARMUTH</emphasis>:  OK.  Well, I don't know enough to ask anything else. So unless anyone else is interested in my time, I will yield it back.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>      I now recognize Mr. McKinley for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I've been here in Congress for five years, five and a half years now, and we've been talking about this for all five and a half years and I don't see much progress being made with it.  And I hear the frustration in some of your voices, but I was hoping we were going to hear today more specifics. If you could pass the magic wand, what would it be?  What's the solution?  I think you started to hinted towards it, but we didn't get close enough.  </p><p>      So one of the things I'd like to try and understand is how we differentiate between privacy and national security.  I don't feel that we've -- we've really come to grips with that.  I don't know how many people are on both sides of that aisle.  I really don't care. I'm very concerned about national security as it relates to encryption.  We've had -- just this past weekend, there was a very provocative TV show with \"60 Minutes\" came out about the hacking into cell phones.  We had -- about a year ago, we all were briefed, it wasn't classified.  It was the -- where Russia hacked in and shut down the electric grid in Ukraine.  The impact that could have that a foreign government could have access to it.  </p><p>      In just this past week at town hall meetings back in the district, twice people raised the issue about hacking and to shutting down the electric grid.  And I -- it reminded me of testimony that had been given to us about a year ago on the very subject when some -- one of the presenters like yourself said that it would -- within four days, a group of engineers in America or kids could shut down the grid from Boston down through -- where was it?  From Boston to New York could shut down in just four days.  I'm very concerned about that, that where we're going with this whole issue of encryption and protection.  </p><p>      So Mr. Galati, if I could ask you a question, just -- how confident are you that the adequacy of the encryption is protecting our infrastructure in your jurisdiction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Well, Sir, cyber-security and infrastructure is very complicated and we have another whole section in the police department and in the city that monitors, works very closely with all the agencies, such as ConEd, DEP and so on.  We also work very closely with the FBI and that joint cyber task force to monitor...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  But my question really is how do you feel?  Because everyone comes in here, they're -- and when I've gone to the power companies, whether -- I don't need to list their names.  But all of them have said we think we've got it.  But yet, hearing that discussion on \"60 Minutes,\" this hacker that was there is a professional hacker, he said, \"I can break into any system.\"  Any system.  So my question again, back to you, is how confident are you that the system is going to work, that it's going to be protected?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Well, I think with all the agencies that are involved in trying to protect critical infrastructure, and I think that there is a big emphasize in New York, I'll speak about New York, working with multiple, multiple agencies, we're looking at vulnerabilities to the system.  I do think that is an encryption issue.  But again, I think what I was speaking about more when it came to encryption is more about communications and investigating crimes or terrorism-related offenses.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  Beyond your jurisdiction, then, on that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  That is not an area that I would comment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  OK.  How about you in Indiana?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  When you're talking about control systems being compromised, again we're talking about firewalls, not encryption. We're talking about the ability for someone to get inside the system, to have the password, to have the pass phrase, something like that to get the firewall.  So encryption of data in motion, as an example, would not protect us from the types of things you're talking about and being able to shut down a power grid.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  It's noteworthy that I saw that \"60 Minutes\" piece, and what that particular hacker was able to exploit would not have been fixed by encryption.  That is a separate system related to how the cellular -- how our cell system works, essentially, completely separate, unrelated from the issue of encryption.  So what I can say is having more robust encryption would not fix either of those problems.  And I lack the background to be able to tell you specifically do I feel confident or not, confident about how the firewalls are right now in the systems you asked about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  Ms. Hess?  Boiler up by the way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  And so, my question back to you -- same to you.  How would you respond to this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  I think that first off, I don't think there's any such thing as 100 percent secure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Anything as a purely secure solution.  With that said, I think it is incumbent on all of us to build the most secure system as possible, but at the same time, representing to you today the challenge that law enforcement has to be able to get, or access or be provided with the information we seek, pursuant to a lawful order.  </p><p>      A warrant that has been signed by a judge to be able to get the information we seek in order to prove or to have evidence that a crime has occurred.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I yield back my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I now recognize Mr. Tonko for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  And thank you to our witnesses. I'm encouraged that here today, we're developing dialogue, which I think is critical for us to best understand the issue from a policy perspective.  </p><p>      And there's no denying that we're at risk with more and more threats to our national security, including cyber threats.  But there's also a strong desire to maintain individual rights and opportunity to store information, and understand and believe that it's protected.  And sometimes those two are very difficult.  There's a tender balance that needs to be struck.  </p><p>      And so I think, you know, first question to any of the three of you is, is there a better outcome in terms of training?  Do you believe that there's better dialogue, better communication, formalized training that would help the law enforcement community, if they network with these companies that develop the technology?  </p><p>      I'm concerned that we don't always have all of the information we require to do our end of the responsibility thing here.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess?  I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  I do think that, certainly, in today's world, we need people who have those specialized skills, who have the training, who have the tools and the resources available to them to be able to better address this challenge.  </p><p>      But with that said, there is still no one-size-fits-all solution to this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  Anything, Chief or Captain, that you'd like to add?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I would just say that we do work very closely with a lot of these companies like Google and we do, you know, share information. And also, you know, at times, work on training amongst the two -- the agency and the company.  </p><p>      So, there is cooperation there.  And I think that it could always get better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  And Ms. Hess in this encryption debate, what specifically would you suggest the FBI is asking for?  Asking of the tech community?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  That when we present an order signed by an independent, neutral judge, that they're able to comply with that order and provide us with the information we're seeking in readable form.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  OK.  And Ms. Hess, is the FBI asking Apple and possibly other companies to create a back door that would then potentially weaken encryption?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I don't believe the FBI or law enforcement in general should be in the position of dictating to companies what the solution is.  They have built those systems, they know their devices and their systems better, certainly, than we do, and how they might be able to build some type of the most secure systems available or the most secure devices available, yet still be able to comply with orders.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  And do you believe that that type of assistance that you're requesting from tech companies would lead to any unintended consequences, such as a weakened order of encryption?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I believe it's best for the tech companies to answer that question, because as they build these solutions to be able to answer these orders, they would know what those vulnerabilities are or potentially could be.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Another potential unintended consequence of U.S. law enforcement gaining special access may be the message that is sent to -- that they're sending to other nations.  </p><p>      Other countries that seek to stifle dissent or oppose their citizens may ask for tools as well.  Right now, even if other countries start to demand such a work around, Apple and other technology companies can legitimately argue they do not have it.  </p><p>      So, Ms. Hess, how would you respond to this argument that requiring tech companies to help subvert their own encryption establishes precedents that could endanger people around the world who rely on protected communications to shield them from despotic regimes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  I would say, first, that in the international community -- and we've had a number of conversations with our partners nationally -- that this is a common problem among law enforcement throughout the world.  </p><p>      And so, as we continue to see this problem, obviously, there are international implications to any solutions that might be developed. But in addition to that, what we seek is through a lawful order with the system that we've set up in this country for the American judicial system to be able to go to a magistrate or a judge to get a warrant, to say that we believe -- we have probable cause to believe that someone or some entity is committing a crime.  </p><p>      I believe that if other countries had such a way of doing business, that that would probably be a good thing for all of us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  And Chief Galati or Captain Cohen, do you have anything to add by what was shared here by Ms. Hess?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  In preparing for the testimony, I saw several news stories that said that Apple provided the source code for IOS China, as an example.  I don't know whether those stories are true or not.  I also tried to find an example of Apple answering the question under oath, and I did not find that.  </p><p>      I noted that Apple said they did not provide a back door to China, but did not talk about the source code.  The source code for the operating system would be the first thing that would be needed to hack into an iPhone, as an example.  And I know that they have not provided a source code to U.S. law enforcement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONKO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Thank you.  My time is exhausted, so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) yield back.  Thank you.  Mr. Hudson, you're recognized for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman.  I'd like to thank the panel for being here today.  Thank you for what you do to keep us safe.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess, as more and more of our lives become part of the digital universe, everything from communications, to medical records, home security systems, the need for strong security becomes all that more important.  </p><p>      At the same time, however, it naturally suggests a massive increase in our digital footprint and the amount of information about the individuals that becomes available on the internet.  </p><p>      Does this present an opportunity for law enforcement to explore new, creative ways to conduct investigations?  I know we've talked a little bit about metadata, and why that may not be a good solution, but new forms of surveillance or other options that maybe we haven't discussed yet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  I do believe that we should make every use of the tools that we've been authorized by Congress and the American people to use.  And if that pertains to metadata or other types of information we might be able to get from new technologies, then certainly, we should take advantage of that in order to accomplish our mission.  </p><p>      But at the same time, clearly, these things have presented challenges to us as well as previously articulated.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  Well, have you and others in law enforcement community engaged with the technology community or others to explore these other types of opportunities, or look at potential ways to do this going forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  We're in daily contact with the industry and with academia in order to try to come up with solutions -- in order to try to come up with ways that we might be able to get evidence in our investigations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  And what have you learned from those conversations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Clearly, technology changes on a very, very rapid pace. And sometimes the providers or the people who build those technologies may not have built in or thought to build in a law enforcement solution, a solution so they can readily provide us with that information, even if they want to.  </p><p>      And in other cases, perhaps it's the way they do business, but they might not want to be able to readily provide that information, or they just may not be set up to do that, either because of resources or just because of the proprietary way that their systems are created.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  I see.  The other members of the panel, do you have any opinion on this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I would just say that as technology advances, it does create a lot of new tools for law enforcement to complete investigations.  </p><p>      However, as those advances, as we start using them, we see them shrinking away.  You know, for -- with encryption especially blocking things that we recently were able to obtain.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  Got you.  You don't have to -- OK.  To all of you, I recently read about the CEO of MSAB, a technology company in the Detroit News article.  It said, \"There's a way for government to access data stored on our phones without building a back door to encryption.\"  His solution is to build a two-part decryption system where both the government and the manufacturer possess a unique decryption key, and that only with both keys, as well as the device in hand could you access the encrypted data on the device.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  I'm not an expert on decryption.  So, I must ask, is such a solution achievable?  And secondly, have there been any discussions between you all and the law enforcement community with the tech community -- or tech industry regarding a proposal like this or something similar that would allow safe access to the data without giving a key, so to speak, to -- to one entity?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  To answer your question, that paradigm would work. That's very similar to the paradigm of the safety deposit box in a bank where you have two different keys.  And that would work, but it would require the cooperation of industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  Anything to add?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS (?)</emphasis>:  That's (ph) what I was going to say.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUDSON</emphasis>:  OK we'll get a chance to hear from industry on our next panel.  I was trying to explain this to my staffers and I said did you see the new Star Wars movie?  Well, you know the map to find Luke, BB- 2 had part of it -- or BB-8 and R2-D2 had the other half so you got to put them together.  Oh, I get it now.  </p><p>      Anyway, I think it is important that law enforcement and technology work together and continue to have these discussions.  </p><p>      I want to thank the Chairman for giving us this opportunity to do that.  </p><p>      I thank you all for being here and with that I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Gentleman yields back.  </p><p>      Recognize Vice Chair of the full committee, Ms.  Blackburn, for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And thank you to the witnesses, I am so appreciative of your time.  And I'm appreciative of the work product that our committee has put into this.  </p><p>      Mr. Welch and I with some of the members that are on the (inaudible) have served on a Privacy and Data Security Task Force for the committee.  Looking at how we construct legislation and looking at what we ought to do, when it comes to the issues of privacy and data security and going back to the law and the intent of the law. </p><p>      I mean, Congress authorized wire taps in 1934.  And then in '67, you come along and there is the language; you've got Katz versus the U.S. that citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  And we know that for you in law enforcement, you come up upon that with this new technology, that sometimes it seems there is the fight between technology and law enforcement.  </p><p>      And the balance that is necessary between that reasonable expectation and looking at the ability of your ability to do your job. Which is to keep citizens safe.  So I thank you for the work that you are doing in this realm.  And considering all of that, I'd like to hear from each of you.  </p><p>      And Ms.  Hess, we'll start with you and just work down the panel. Do you think that at this point there's an adversarial relationship between the private sector and law enforcement?  And if you advise us, what should be our framework, and what should be the penalties that are put in place that will help you to get these criminals out of the virtual space?  </p><p>      And help our citizens know that their virtual you, their presence online, is going to be protected but that you are going to have the ability to help keep them safe?  Kind of a load of questions; we've got two minutes and 36 seconds so it's all yours and we will move down the line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  As far as whether there's an adversarial relationship, my response is I hope not.  Certainly, from our perspective and the FBI, we want to work with industry.  We want to work with academia.  We do believe that we have the same values.  </p><p>      We share the same values in this country that we want our citizens to be protected.  We also very much value our privacy.  And we all do.  I think as you noted, for over 200 years, this country has balanced privacy and security.  These are not binary things.  It shouldn't be one or the other.  </p><p>      It should be both working cooperatively together and how do we do that?  I don't think that's for the FBI to decide nor do I think it's for tech companies to decide unilaterally.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  No, it will be for Congress to decide, we need your advice.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I think that it's not an adversarial relationship either.  I mean there are so many things that we have to work with. All the big tech companies, Twitter, Google, Facebook on threats that are coming in on a regular business.  </p><p>      They are very cooperative and we do work with them in certain areas.  This is a new area that we're going into but right now I would say it's not adversarial.  They're actually very cooperative.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I agree with the other two, that is not an adversarial relationship.  But ]as you mentioned, some of the statutes that authorize wire tap lawful interception, authorized a collection of evidence, they have not been updated recently.  </p><p>      And as technology at an exponential pace evolves, some of the statutes have not evolved to keep up with them and we just lack the technical ability at this point to properly execute the laws that Congress has passed because the technology has by-passed the law.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  OK and we would appreciate hearing from you, as we look at these updates.  The physical space statutes are there.  But we need that application to the virtual space.  And this is where it would be helpful to hear from you.  </p><p>      What is that framework?  What are those penalties?  What enables you to best enforce?  And so if you could just submit to us -- I'm running out of time but submit to us your thoughts on that.  It would be helpful and we would appreciate it.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Gentlelady (ph) yields back.  </p><p>      Now recognize Mr. Cramer, for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAMER</emphasis>:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I thank all of you.  It's refreshing to participate in a hearing where the people asking the questions don't know the answer until you give it to us.  That's really cool.  </p><p>      I want to hone real specifically on the issue of breaking modern encryption by brute force, as we call it.  And that is the ability to apply multiple pass codes and perhaps an unlimited number of pass codes until you break it.  That's sort of the trick, here.  </p><p>      With the iPhone specifically, there's the issue of the data destruction feature.  Would removing the data destruction feature sort of be at least a partial solution to the -- to your side of the formula?  </p><p>      In other words, you know, we're not creating the back door, but we are removing one of the tools.  And I'm just open minded to it and looking for your out-loud thoughts on that issue.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir, if I may.  Certainly, that is one potential solution that we do use and we should continue to use.  To be able to guess the right password is something that we employ in a wide variety and number of investigations.  The problem and the challenge is that sometimes those pass code links may get longer and longer.  </p><p>      They may involve alphanumeric characters, they may present to us special challenges that it would take years, if ever, to actually solve that problem, regardless of what type of computing resources we might apply.  </p><p>      And so to that point, we ask our investigators to help us be better guessers in order to come up with information or intelligence to help us make a better guess.  But that's not always possible. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAMER</emphasis>:  But -- if I might, with -- you get ten tries and you're out data destruction feature that iPhone utilized.  That makes your job all the more difficult.  Would be expanding that from 10 to 20 or unlimited, is there some -- I'm not looking for magic formula.  It seems to me there could be some way to at least increase your chances.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir, and that's one of the things that does quite clearly present to us a challenge.  Is that usually it takes us more than ten guesses before we get the right answer, if at all.  In addition to that, many companies have implemented services or types of procedures so that there is a time delay between guesses.  So after five guesses, for example, you have to wait a minute or 15 minutes or a day in order to guess between those pass codes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAMER</emphasis>:  Others?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I don't think, personally, that the brute force solution would provide a substantive solution to the problem.  As Ms.  Hess mentioned, oftentimes, that delay is built in.  </p><p>       IOS, as an example, went from a four digit pin to a six digit pin.  So what you're is increasing the number of guesses to guess it right.  So if you were to legislate that, it would not wipe the data and overwrite the data after a specific period of time.  </p><p>       You would have to write in that pass codes could only be of a certain complexity, a certain length and that would degrade security. What's important to understand is we want security, we want hard encryption but also need a way to quickly be able to access that data because of the investigations I work, oftentimes I'm running against the clock to try to identify a child victim.  </p><p>       And being able to brute force that, even a matter of days, yet alone weeks or months, that's not fast enough.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAMER</emphasis>:  Yes, well, thanks for your testimony and all that you do.  I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Our tradition is to allow someone else outside the committee if you want to ask questions.  </p><p>      Mr. (inaudible), you're recognized for five minutes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  I thank the chairman.  </p><p>      I thank witness for your service to our country.  I heard at least one of you state in your opening testimony that Congress is the correct forum to make decisions on data security.  And I agree with that.  </p><p>      However, encryption-related issues are technical.  They're complicated.  Most members of Congress aren't really experts in these areas.  Therefore, it's appropriate that Congress authorize a panel of experts from relevant fields to review the issues then advise the Congress.  </p><p>      The McCaul legislation does exactly that.  Do each of you agree with that approach -- the McCaul legislation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I believe we do need to work with industry and academia and all the relevant parties in order to come up with the right solution.  Yes, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  So you do agree that that's the right approach, to convene a panel of experts on cybersecurity and privacy and so on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I believe that construct, we -- I -- there are varying aspects of that construct.  But yes, that premise I would agree with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  OK.  Captain -- Chief?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Sir, I really couldn't comment because I haven't seen that bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  It basically...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I do agree with Ms. Hess that, you know, we need to work together.  I think we need to have, you know, a panel of experts that can advise and work with Congress.  I do believe that the answer is in Congress.  So I do agree with the principle of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  OK.  Thank you.  </p><p>      Captain?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Whatever paradigm helps members of Congress feel comfortable that they are properly balancing civil liberties and security, versus the ability for law enforcement to conduct investigations, whatever paradigm serves that purpose, I fully support.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Chief Galati and Captain Cohen, you've eliminated some of the information that has been available before in cell phones, but no longer is available because of encryption.  I thank you for doing that.  I was a little in the dark about that.  </p><p>      What haven't we heard, though, about information that is now available that wasn't available in the past because of technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Sir, I'm having problems thinking of an example of information that's available now that was not before.  From my perspective, thinking through investigations that we previously had information for, when you combine the encryption issue along with shorter -- shorter retention periods for service providers, keeping the records both metadata and data for shorter periods of time available to the legal process.  I'm having difficulty finding an example of an avenue that's available that was not before.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  So, I would only say I've been in the police department for 32 years, so technology really has opened up a lot of avenues for law enforcement.  So I do think there's a lot of things that we are able to obtain today that we couldn't obtain 10 or 20 years ago.  </p><p>      So, technology has helped law enforcement.  However, the encryption issue, and I think the issue that we're speaking on today, is definitely eliminating a lot of those gains we've made.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess, requiring backdoor or exceptional access would drive customers to overseas suppliers.  And if so, we would gain nothing by requiring backdoor or exceptional access.  Do you agree or disagree with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I disagree in the sense that I think many countries are having this same conversation and the same discussion currently because law enforcement in those countries has the same countries that we do.  And so I think this will just continue to be a larger and larger issue.   </p><p>      So while it may temporarily drive certain people who may decide that it's too much of a risk to be able to do business here in this country, I don't think that that's the majority.  I think the majority of consumers actually want good products and those products are made here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  Well, thank you for calling out the quality of American products.  I appreciate that, especially since my neighbor here and I represent the part of California where those products are developed.  </p><p>      But I think there's always going to be countries where products are available that would supersede whatever requirements we make. Also, requiring backdoor access would alert potential bad actors that there are weaknesses designed into our system and motivate them to try and find those weaknesses.  Do you agree with that or not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I don't believe there's anything such as a 100 percent secure system.  So I think there will always be people who are trying to find and exploit those vulnerabilities.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCNERNEY</emphasis>:  But if we design weaknesses into the system and everybody knows about it, they're going to be looking for those -- and those are design weaknesses.  I mean, I don't see how that could further security of critical infrastructure and so on.  So that's -- well, I guess my time is expired, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      The chair recognizes Congressman Bilirakis for five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate so very much.  </p><p>      Ms. Hess, thanks for participating in today's much-needed hearing.  Appreciate all -- the entire panel.  We are certainly at a crossroads of technology and the law, and having you and the FBI perspective is imperative, in my opinion.  </p><p>      I have a question about timing.  The recent debate has been revived as technology companies are using strong end-to-end encryption.  And you described the problem as growing.    </p><p>      What will a hearing like this look like a year from now or two years from now?  What do you foresee is the next evolutionary step in the encryption debate so we can attempt to get ahead of it?  And as processors become faster, will the ability to encrypt keep increasing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  My reaction to that is that if things don't change, then this hearing a year from now we would be sitting here giving you examples of how we are unable to solve cases or find predators or rescue victims in increasing numbers.  And that would be the challenge for us, is how can we keep that from happening and how might we be able to come up with solutions, working cooperatively together.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Again, the next question is for the entire panel, please.  What have been some successful collaboration lessons between law enforcement and software or hardware manufacturers dealing with encryption?  And are there any building blocks or success stories we can build upon?  Or have the recent advancements in strong encryption made any previous success obsolete?  </p><p>      For the entire panel.  Who would like to go first?  Ms. Hess?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  I apologize, but could I ask you to -- I'm not 100 percent clear on that question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  OK.  Let me repeat it, for the entire panel again.  </p><p>      What have been some successful collaboration lessons between law enforcement and software or hardware manufacturers dealing with encryption?  That's the first question.  </p><p>      Are there any building blocks or success stories we can build upon?  Or have the recent advancements in strong encryption made any previous success obsolete?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  Certainly, we deal with industry on a daily basis to try to come up with the most secure ways of being able to provide us with that information, and still be responsive to our requests and our orders.  </p><p>      I think that building on our successes from the past, clearly there are certain companies -- for example, as has already been stated here today, that fell under CALEA.  And those CALEA-covered providers have built ways to be able to respond to appropriate orders.  And that's provided us with a path so that they know when they build those systems what exactly we're looking for and how we need to receive that information.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Sir?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, sir, I really couldn't comment on that. That's not really an area of expertise of mine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  I concur with what Ms. Hess said.  There are a few technology companies that have worked with law enforcement to provide a legal solution, and they've done it voluntarily.  So we know the technological solution.  They provide a legal solution such that we can access data.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  And building on those collaborations, and having other industry members follow in that path would be of great help.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Next question for the panel.  What percentage of all cases are jeopardized due to the suspect having an encrypted device, whether it is a cell phone, laptop, desktop or something else?  I recognize there are some cases, such as pornography, it may be 100 percent impossible to charge someone without decrypting their storage device.  But what about the other cases where physical evidence or other evidence might be available?  Does metadata fill in the gaps?   </p><p>      And for the entire panel; let's start with Ms. Hess, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, sir.  We are increasingly seeing the issue. Currently in just the first six months of this fiscal year, starting from last October, we're seeing in the FBI the number of cell phones that we have seized as evidence.  We're encountering passwords about 30 percent of the time.  And we have no capability around 13 percent of that time.    </p><p>      So we've seen those numbers continue to increase and clearly that presents us with a challenge.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GALATI</emphasis>:  Sir, just -- I'll give you some numbers.  We have approximately 102 devices that we couldn't get in, and these are 67 of them being Apple devices.  And if I just look at the 67 Apple devices, 10 of them are related to homicide, two to rapes, one to a criminal sex act, and two are related to two members of the police department that were shot.  </p><p>      So we are seeing an increase as we go forward of phones, not getting information on the phones.  </p><p>      One thing I will say, it doesn't always prevent us from making an arrest.  However, it doesn't present all the evidence available for the prosecution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  And to expand on what the Chief said, that can be exculpatory evidence we don't have access to.  The sad part is when our forensic examiners get called, we ask a series of questions of investigator, \"is there an iPhone, which model?\"  If we're told a it's a model for example,  5s or newer, 164 operating system, and it's encrypted, we don't even take that into evidence anymore because we know there's no technical solution.  </p><p>      So the problem is we never know what we don't know.  We don't know what evidence we're missing whether that is, again, on a suspect's phone or victim's phone where the victim is not capable of giving us that pass code.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back the time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I think we have one last question for the first panel. That's from the gentlelady from California, Ms. Eshoo.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Thank you for extending that legislative courtesy to be here and join in on this hearing because I'm not a member of the subcommittee.  The rules of the committee allow us to, and I appreciate your courtesy.  </p><p>      I first want to go to Captain Cohen.  I first heard you say Apple disclosed its source code to the Chinese government.  I believe that you said that.  That's a huge allegation for NYPD to base on some news stories.  Can you confirm this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  I'm with Indiana State Police, not NYPD.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  I'm sorry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COHEN</emphasis>:  What I said in my testimony, I have found several news stories but I was unable to find anything to either confirm or deny...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Did you say that?  I didn't hear all of your presentation around that allegation.  But I think it's very important for the record that we set this straight.  That takes my breath away.  That's a huge allegation.  So thank you.  </p><p>      To Ms. Hess,  the San Bernardino case is really illustrative for many reasons.  One of the more striking aspects to me is the way in which FBI approached the issue to gaining access to that now infamous iPhone.  We know the FBI went to court to force a private company to create a system solely for the purpose for the government.  I think that's breathtaking.  It takes my breath away to try and digest that. And then, to use that information whenever and however it wishes.  </p><p>      Some disagree, some agree, but I think that this is a worthy and very, very important discussion.  Now, this came about after the government missed a key opportunity to back up and potentially recover information from the device by resetting the iCloud password in the days following the shooting.  The Congress has appropriated just shy of $9 billion, with a \"b,\" dollars for the FBI.  Now out of that $9 billion and how those dollars are spread across the agency, how is it that the FBI didn't know what to do?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  How can that be?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  If I may, in the aftermath of San Bernardino, we were looking for any way to identify whether or not...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Did you ask Apple -- did you call Apple right away and say, we have this in our possession.  This is what we need to get. How do we do it, because we don't know how?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  We did have discussions with Apple.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  When?  After it was essentially destroyed because more than 10 attempts were made relative to the pass code?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  I'm not sure.  I'll have to take that as a question for the record.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  I'd like to know, Ms. Hess, your response to this.  </p><p>      I served for almost a decade on the House Intelligence Committee. During my tenure, Michael Hayden was the CIA director.  Now he's the former director of CIA, he has said, \"America is safer with unbreakable end to end encryption.\"  Tell me what your response is to that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  My response... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  I think cyber crime, I might add, excuse me, is embedded in this whole issue but I'd like to hear your response to the former director of the CIA.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  From what I have read and heard from what he has said, he certainly, I believe, emphasizes and captures what was occurring at the time that he was in charge of those agencies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Has his thinking stopped from the time he was CIA director to being former, and he doesn't understand encryption any longer?  What are you suggesting?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  No ma'am, technology proceeds at such a rapid pace, one must be constantly in that business in order to keep up with the iterations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Let me ask you about this.  Once criminals know that American encryption products are open to government surveillance, what's going to stop them from using encrypted products and applications that fall outside of the jurisdiction of American law enforcement?  I've heard you repeat over and over again, \"we're talking to people in Europe, we're talking.\"  I don't know, is there a body that you're working through?  Has this been formalized?  Because if this stops at our border but doesn't include others, this is a big problem for the United States of America, law enforcement, and American products.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  The gentlelady's time has expired.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Can she respond?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  Yes ma'am, we are working with international committee, our international partners on that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  How?  Is there some kind of international body you're working through?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Can she answer that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Do you want to finish your remark?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HESS</emphasis>:  There's no one specific organization that we work through. There are a number of organizations we work through to that extent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, I'd ask unanimous consent all of the members of the Committee, as well as the members of the full Committee who have been asked to sit in be allowed to supplement their verbal answers with written answers of the witnesses.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Approved.  </p><p>      Without any members seeking to be recognized for questions I'd like to thank the witnesses for their testimony today.  Now I'd like to call the witnesses for our second panel to the table.  Thank you again.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  OK.  Start the second panel, I'd like to introduce the witnesses of our second panel for today's hearing, starting with Mr. Bruce Sewell will lead off the second panel.  Mr. Sewell is Apple's General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Legal and Global Security.  He serves on the company's executive board and overseas all legal matters including corporate governance, global security and privacy.  </p><p>      We thank Mr. Sewell for being with us today and look forward to his comments.  </p><p>      We'd also like to welcome Amit Yoran -- is that close enough? Thank you -- Mr. Yoran, the president of RSA security.  RSA is an American computer and network security company, and as president, Mr. Yoran is responsible for developing RSA's strategic vision and operational execution across the business.  </p><p>      Thanks to Mr. Yoran for appearing before us today, and we appreciate his testimony.  </p><p>      Next, we welcome Dr. Matthew Blaze, associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Blaze is a researcher in the area of secure systems, cryptology and trust management.  He has been at the forefront of these issues for over a decade and we appreciate his being here today and offering his testimony on this very important issue.  </p><p>      Finally, I'd like to introduce Dr. Daniel Weitzner, who is director and principle research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Decentralized Information Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </p><p>      Mr. Weitzner previously served as the United States deputy chief technological officer for internet policy in the White House.  We thank him for being with us today, and look forward to learning from his expertise.  </p><p>      I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here and look forward to the discussion.  </p><p>      Now, as we begin, you are aware this committee is holding an investigative hearing, and when doing so, has had the practice of taking testimony under oath.  </p><p>      Do any of you have objection to testifying under oath? </p><p>      OK, seeing none, the chair then advises you that under the rules of the House and rules of the committee, you're entitled to be advised by counsel.  </p><p>      Do any of you desire to be represented or advised by counsel during your testimony today?  </p><p>      Seeing none.  In that case, if you would please rise and raise your right-hand, I will swear you in.  </p><p>      Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?  Thank you.  You're now under oath and subject to the penalties set forth in Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code.  </p><p>      You now have a five-minute summary -- each of you may be able to give a five-minute summary of your written statement, starting with Mr. Sewell.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  (Inaudible).  Better?  Great.  </p><p>      Thank you Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette and members of the subcommittee.  It's my pleasure to appear before you today on behalf of Apple.  We appreciate your invitation and the opportunity to be part of this important discussion on encryption.  </p><p>      Hundreds of millions of people trust Apple products with the most intimate details of their daily lives.  Some of you may have a smart phone in your pocket right now.  And if you think about it, there's probably more information stored on that phone than a thief could get by breaking into your home.  </p><p>      And it's not a phone -- it's a photo album, it's a wallet, it's how you communicate with your doctor, your partner and your kids. It's also the command central for your car and your home.  </p><p>      Many people also use their smart phone to authenticate and to gain access into other networks, businesses, financial systems and critical infrastructure.  And we feel a great sense of responsibility to protect that information and that access.  </p><p>      For all of these reasons, our digital devices, indeed, our entire digital lives are increasingly and persistently under siege from attackers, and their attacks grow more sophisticated every day.  This quest for access fuels a multi-billion dollar covert world of thieves, hackers and crooks.  </p><p>      We're all aware of some of the recent large scale attacks. Hundreds of thousands of social security numbers were stolen from the IRS.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has said as many as 21 million records were compromised and as many as 78 million people were affected by an attack on Anthem's health insurance records.  </p><p>      The best way that we and the technology industry know how to protect your information is through the use of strong encryption. Strong encryption is a good thing.  It is a necessary thing.  </p><p>      And the government agrees.  Encryption today is the backbone of our cyber security infrastructure, and provides the very best defense we have against increasingly hostile attacks.  The United States has spent tens of millions of dollars through the Open Technology Fund and other programs to fund strong encryption.  </p><p>      And the administration's review group on intelligence and communications technology urged the U.S. Government to fully support, and not in any way to subvert, undermine or weaken generally available commercial encryption software.  </p><p>      At Apple, with every release of hardware and software, we advance the safety, security and data protection features in our products.  We work hard also to assist law enforcement, because we share their goal of creating a safer world.  </p><p>      I manage a team of dedicated professionals that are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Not a day goes by where someone on my team is not working with law enforcement.  </p><p>      We know from our interaction with law enforcement officials that the information we're providing is extremely useful in helping to prevent and solve crimes.  Keep in mind, that the people subject to law enforcement inquiries represent far less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our hundreds of millions of users.  </p><p>      But all of those users, 100 percent of them, would be made more vulnerable if we were forced to build a back door.  </p><p>      As you've heard from our colleagues in law enforcement, they have the perception that encryption walls off information from them.  But technologists and national security experts don't see the world that way.  We see a data-rich world that seems to be full of information, information that law enforcement can use to solve and prevent crimes. This difference in perspective, this is where we should be focused.  </p><p>      To suggest that the American people must choose between privacy and security is to present a false choice.  The issue is not about privacy at the expense of security, it's about maximizing safety and security.  </p><p>      We feel strongly Americans will be better off if we can offer the very best protections for their digital lives.  </p><p>      Mr. Chairman, that's where I was going to conclude my comments, but I think I owe it to this committee to add one additional thought. And I want to be very clear on this.  </p><p>      We have not provided source code to the Chinese government.  We did not have a key 19 months ago that we threw away.  We have not announced that we're going to apply pass code encryption to the next generation iCloud.  </p><p>      I just want to be very clear on that, because we heard three allegations.  Those allegations have no merit. </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  And we turn now to the second panelist, Mr. Yoran.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:   Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on encryption.  </p><p>      This is a very complex and nuanced issue, and I applaud the committee's efforts to better understand all aspects of this debate. My name is Amit Yoran, and I am the president of RSA, the security division of EMC.  </p><p>      I'd like to thank my mom for coming to hear my testimony today. In case things go sideways, I assure you she's much tougher than she looks.  </p><p>      I've spent over 20 years in the cyber security field.  In my current role, I strive to ensure that RSA provides industry leading cyber security solutions.  </p><p>RSA has been a cyber security industry leader for more than 30 years.  The more than 30,000 global customers we serve represent every sector of our economy.  Fundamental to RSA's understanding of the issues at hand, is our rich heritage in encryption; it is a basis for cyber security technology.  </p><p>      Our cyber security products are found in government agencies, banks, utilities, retailers, as well as hospitals and schools.  At our core, we at RSA believe in the power of digital technology to fundamentally transform business and society for the better, and that the pervasiveness of our technology helps to protect everyone.  </p><p>      Let me take a moment to say that we deeply appreciate the work of law enforcement and the national security community to protect our nation.  I commend the men and women of law enforcement who have dedicated their lives to serving justice.  Private industry has long partnered with law enforcement agencies to advance and protect our nation and the rule of law.  </p><p>      Where lawful court orders mandate it, or where moral alignment encourages it, many tech companies have a regular, ongoing and cooperative relationship with law enforcement in the U.S. and abroad.  </p><p>      Simply put, it is in all of our best interests for the laws to be enforced.  </p><p>      I have four points I'd like to present today, all of which I've extrapolated on in my written testimony.  </p><p>      First, this is no place for extreme positions or rush decisions. The line connecting privacy and security is as delicate to national security as it is to our prosperity as a nation.  </p><p>      I encourage you to continue to evaluate the issue and not rush to a solution.  </p><p>      Second, law enforcement has access to a lot of valuable information they need to do their job.  I would encourage you to ensure that the FBI and law enforcement agencies have the resources and are prioritizing the tools and technical expertise required to keep up with the evolution of technology, and meet their important mission.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Third, strong encryption is foundational to good cyber security.  If we lower the bar there, we expose ourselves further to those that would do us harm.  </p><p>      As you know, recent and heinous terrorist attacks have reinvigorated calls for exceptional access mechanisms.  This is a call to create back door to allow law enforcement access to all encrypted information.  Exceptional access increases complexity and introduces new vulnerabilities.  It undermines integrity of internet infrastructure and introduces more risk, not less, to our national interests.  </p><p>      Creating a back door to encryption means creating opportunity for more people with nefarious intentions to harm us.  Sophisticated adversaries and criminals would not knowingly use methods they know law enforcement could access, particularly when foreign encryption is readily available.  Therefore, any perceived gains to our security from exceptional access are greatly overestimated.    </p><p>      Fourth, this is a basic principle of economics with very serious consequences.  Our standard of living depends on the goods and services we can produce.  If we require exceptional access from U.S. based companies that would make our information economy less secure, the market will go else where.  But worse than that, it would weaken our power, and utilities, our infrastructures, manufacturing, health care, defense, and financial systems.  </p><p>      Weakening encryption would significantly weaken our nation. Simply put, exceptional access does more harm than good.  This is the seemingly unanimous opinion of the entire tech industry, academia, the national security community as well as all industries that rely on encryption and secure products.  In closing, I'd like to thank all the members of the Committee for the dedication in understanding this very complex issue.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Dr. Blaze.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee for the opportunity to testify before you today.  The encryption issue, which as you know I've been involved with for over two decades now, has been characterized as a question of whether we can build systems that keep the good guys -- a of the good guys in but keep the bad guys out.  And much of the debate has focused on questions of whether we can trust the government with the keys for data.   </p><p>      But before we can ask that question, and that's a legitimate political question that the political process is well equipped to answer, there's an underlying technical question of whether we can trust the technology to actually give us a system that does that.  And unfortunately, we simply don't know how to do that safely and securely at any scale and in general across the wide range of systems that exist today and that we depend on.  </p><p>      It would be wonderful if we could.  It would solve -- if we could build systems with that kind of assurance, it would solve so many of the problems in computer security and in general computer systems that have been with us since really the very beginning of software-based systems.  But unfortunately many of the problems are deeply fundamental.    </p><p>      The state of computer and network security today can really only be characterized as a national crisis.  We hear about large scale data breaches, compromises of personal information, financial information, and national security information literally on a daily basis today. And as systems become more interconnected and become more relied upon for the function of the fabric of our society and for our critical infrastructure, the frequency of these breaches and their consequences have been increasing.  </p><p>      If computer science had a good solution for making large scale robust software, we would be deploying it with enormous enthusiasm today.  It is really at the core of fundamental problems that we have. But we are fighting a battle against complexity and scale that we are barely able to keep up with.  I wish my field had simpler and better solutions to offer but it simply does not.    </p><p>      We have only two good tools, tried and true tools, that work for building reliable robust systems.  One of those is to build the systems to be as simple as possible, to have them include as few functions as possible, to decrease what we call the attack surface of these systems.  Unfortunately we want systems that are more complex and more integrated with other things and that becomes harder and harder to do.  </p><p>      The second tool we have is photography, which allows us to trust fewer components of the system, rely on fewer component of the system, and manage the inevitable insecurity that we have.  Unfortunately proposals for exceptional access methods that have been advocated by law enforcement, and we heard advocated for by some of the members of the previous panel, work against really the only two tools that we have for building more robust systems, and we need all the help we can get to secure our national infrastructure across the board.    </p><p>      There's overwhelming consensus in the technical community that these requirements are incompatible with good security engineering practice.  I can refer you to a paper I collaborated on called Keys Under Door Mats that I referenced in my written testimony that I think describes the consensus of the technical community pretty well here.  </p><p>      It's unfortunate that this debate has been so focused on this narrow and very potentially dangerous solution of mandates for back doors and exceptional access, because it leaves unexplored potentially viable alternatives that may be quite fruitful for law enforcement going forward.   </p><p>      One of -- there's no single magic bullet that will solve all of law enforcement problems here, or really anywhere in law enforcement. But a sustained and committed understanding of things like exploitation of data in the cloud, data available in the hands of third parties, targeted exploitation of end devices such as Ms. Hess described in her testimony will require significant resources but have the potential to address many of the problems law enforcement described.  And we owe it to them, and to all of us, to explore them as fully as we can.  Thank you very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  Thank you Vice Chairman McKinley, Chairman Murphy and Ranking Member DeGette.  Thank you for having me.  I think this hearing comes at a very important time in the debate about how to best accommodate the very real needs of law enforcement in the digital age. I want to say I don't think there's any sense in which law enforcement is exaggerating or overstating the challenges they face and I don't think they should be surprised they have big challenges.    </p><p>      We think about introduction of computers in our society, in our workplace and in our homes, to be colloquial, it throws every one for a loop for a little while and our institutions take a while to adjust. We shouldn't expect this problem to be solved overnight.  </p><p>      I do think that's happening at this point in the debate however is that as some of the previous witnesses said, we are, I think, seeing a growing consensus that introducing mandatory infrastructure- wide back doors is not the right approach.  I'm going to talk about some ways we can move forward but I want so say why I think it is and it comes back to safe-deposit box analogy we heard.    </p><p>      We all do think it's reasonable banks should have a second key to our safe-deposit boxes and maybe even you should have drills that can drill through those locks in the event you can't find one of the keys. But the problem here is we're all using the same safe, every single one of us.  So if we make those safe-deposit boxes so that they're a little too easy to drill into or someone gets a hold of the key, then everyone is at risk, not just the couple thousand customers who happen to be at one bank.  </p><p>      That's why we see political leaders really from all around the world now rejecting the idea of mandatory back doors.  Recently Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said, I'm not a believer in back doors or single technical approach.  I don't think it's realistic, he said. Robert Hanigan, who's the Director of the UK Surveillance Agency GCHQ, said in a talk he delivered at MIT last month that mandatory back doors are not the solution.  He said encryption should not be weakened, let alone banned.  But neither is it true nothing can  be done without weakening encryption.  He said I'm not in favor of weakening encryption or mandatory back doors.   </p><p>      And very tellingly, the Vice President of the European Commission, who was the former Prime Minister of Estonia and famous for digitizing almost the entire country and the government, said if people know there are back doors, how could people who, for example, vote online trust the results of the election if they know their government has a key to break into the system?    </p><p>      Two very quick steps that I think we should avoid going forward, and then a few suggestions about how to approach this challenge that you face.  Number one, I think you've heard us all say we have to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities into an already quite vulnerable information infrastructure. It would nice if we could choose that only the bad guys got weak encryption and the rest of us got all strong encryption but I think we understand that's simply not possible.    </p><p>      You've also heard reference to CALEA, a piece of legislation in this committee's jurisdiction.  There have been calls to address the difficult or this very difficult question by simply extending CALEA to apply to internet companies.  But if you look closely at CALEA, it shows just how hard it will be to solve the problem in one size fits all solution.    </p><p>      CALEA was targeted to a very small group of telecommunications companies that provided basically all the same product, and were regulated in then a pretty stable way by Federal Communications Commission.  The internet and platform industry and the mobile apps, and device industry is incredibly diverse, global industry.  </p><p>      And there's no single regulatory agency that governs those services and products.  That's very much by design, and so I think trying to impose a top down regulatory solution on this whole complex of industries in order to solve this problem simply won't work.    </p><p>      What can we do going forward?    </p><p>      Number one, I think that in the efforts of the encryption working group that this committee and the judiciary committee have set up, I think it's very important to look closely at the specific situations law enforcement faces, at the specific court orders that have been issued which have been successfully satisfied, which haven't, which introduce system wide vulnerabilities if they were followed through and which actually could be pursued without system wide risk.  I think there's a lot to be learned about the best practices both of law enforcement and technology companies.  </p><p>      And there are probably some law enforcement agencies and technology companies that could up their game a little bit if they had a better sense of how to approach this issue.  I also think it's awfully important that we make sure to preserve public trust in this environment, in this internet environment.    </p><p>      I think we understand in the last five years that there's been significant concern from the public about the powers both of government and private sector organizations.  I think it's a great step that the house judiciary committee is moving forward and amendments Electronic Communications Privacy Act that will protect data in the cloud.   </p><p>      And I think we can do more of that and ensure public that their data is protected both in the context of government surveillance and private sector use that we'll be able to move forward with this issue more constructively.  Thanks very much and I'm looking forward to the discussion.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And thank you very much for your testimony and for the whole panel, if I might recognize myself for the first five minutes with some questions.  Mr. Sewell, you made quite a point that you have not provided the source codes to China. That was interesting.  And it had come up in the earlier panel on that.  Were you ever asked to provide by anyone?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  By the Chinese government or anyone?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  We have been asked by the Chinese government, we refused.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  How recent were you asked?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:   Within the past two years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  OK.  Mr. Yoran, I've got a couple questions for you. First I was a little taken back, you said don't rush on this solution, or whatever that might be.  As I said earlier, this has been 5 1/2 years I've been hearing everyone talk about it and they are not getting anything done.  I think we're waiting.  I don't know what we're waiting for.  There's got to be a solution.  I'm one of three licensed engineers in Congress. And by now we would have the solution if there were more engineers and less attorneys here, perhaps.  </p><p>      But if I might, your question, I understand your company was founded by original creators of critical algorithm and public key cryptography.  Needless to say encryption is your company's DNA.  If anyone understands the importance of protecting encryption keys, it's your company.    </p><p>      Yet, apparently several years ago, someone stole your seed keys. And as I understand, these are the keys that generate keys, that are used for remote access, much like those used by members and their staff.  If a company like yours, as sophisticated as it is with all the securities that you have, it can lose control of encryption keys, how can we have confidence in others -- and especially smaller companies -- the ability to do the same.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:   Mr. Chairman, I think you bring up two great points. The first statement I would make is that I'd like to highlight the fact a tremendous amount of cooperation happens currently between law enforcement and the tech community.  So the characterization we've made no progress over the last five years I think understates the level of effort put forth by the tech community to reply to and support the efforts of law enforcement.    </p><p>      I think what's occurring is -- and I won't call it a line in the sand, but I think the current requests of law enforcement have now gotten to the point where they are requesting a mandate that our product be less secure and will have a tremendous and profound negative impact on our society and public safety as has already been made the point earlier.    </p><p>      The second point regarding RSA's own breach I think that highlights the very critical role encryption plays in the entire cyber security puzzle.  The fact that sophisticated threat actors, nation, state or cyber criminals are going to target the supply chain and where strong encryption and strong cyber security capabilities come from.  </p><p>      We're dealing with incredibly sophisticated adversary and one that would put forth a tremendous effort to find back doors any if they were embedded in our security systems.  It highlights the value of encryption to society in general.  And I think it also highlights the importance of transparency around cyber breaches and cyber security issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:   Thank you.  In the first testimony, first panel, stay with you, Mr. Yoran, talked a little bit about security of our infrastructure.  And I think the response was along the line that that's not -- it's not an encryption problem, it's a firewall problem.   </p><p>      I'm not sure that the American public understands the difference between that.  And so I'm going to go back.  How comfortable should we be, can we be, that we have proper protection on our security from firms like yours that our energy, our transportation system, particularly our grid, as I said, we've been -- we're subject to it. We know we've already been attacked once.  So what more should we be doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:   Mr. Chairman, I think the point made by the response provided by earlier panelist was wrong.  I think encryption plays an incredibly important role in protecting critical infrastructure.  It is not -- this is a firewall solution or encryption solution, most organizations that truly understand cyber security have a diverse set of products, applications, and many layers of defenses, knowing that adversaries are going to get in through fire walls.    </p><p>      Not only adversaries but important openings are created in fire walls so that the appropriate parties can communicate through them as well. And those paths are frequently leveraged by adversaries to do nefarious things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  So are you acknowledging then we still are very vulnerable to  someone shutting down our electric grid?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  I believe we're extremely vulnerable in any infrastructure that leverages technology.  How much of it is the entire grid, how much is localized, I certainly believe utilities are exposed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Let me just say in closing to all four of you, if you've got some suggestions how we might address this, I'm hearing time and time in the district with our grid system, I'd sure like to hear back from you about what we might be able to do.  With that yield the next question from the ranking member from Colorado, Mrs. DeGette.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:   Thank you so much.  Well following up on the last question, I'd like to stipulate that I believe, as most members of the panel believe that strong encryption is really critical to national security and everything else.    </p><p>      But as I said in my opening statement, I also recognize that we need to try to give law enforcement the ability to apprehend criminals when criminals are utilizing this technology to be able to commit their crimes and cover up after the crimes.  So, first of all, Mr. Sewell, I believe you testified that your company works with law enforcement now is that correct?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  That is correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thanks.   </p><p>      And -- and I think that you would also acknowledge that while encryption really does provide benefit both for consumers and for society for security and privacy, we also need to address this thorny issue about how we deal with criminals and terrorists who are using encrypted devices and technologies.  Is that correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I think this is a very real problem.  And let me start by saying that the conversation we're engaged in now I think has become something of a conflict -- Apple versus the FBI...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Right.  And I don't...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  ... and that's just the wrong approach.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  ... and you don't agree with that, I would hope.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I absolutely do not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And Mr. Yoran, you don't agree with that, that it's -- that it's technology versus law enforcement, do you?  Yes or no will work.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  No, I don't agree it's technology...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  OK.  And I'm assuming that you, Dr. Blaze?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And how about you, Mr. Weitzner?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  No.  Well, that's good.  </p><p>      So, I just -- here's another question, then.  And I asked the last panel that.  Do you think it's a good idea for the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to have to go to third-party hackers to get -- to get access to data for which they have court orders to get?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I don't think that's a good idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Do you think so, Mr. Yoran?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  No, ma'am.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Dr. Blaze?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  No, I think that -- if I could just clarify.  The fact that the FBI had to go to a third party indicates that the FBI either had or devoted insufficient resources to finding a solution...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Right.  And they couldn't do it on their own.   </p><p>      Right.  I'm going to get to that in a second.  </p><p>      So -- so it's just really not a good model.  So -- so, here's my question.   </p><p>      Mr. Yoran, do you think that the government should enhance it's own capabilities to penetrate encrypted systems and pursue work- arounds when legally entitled to information they cannot obtain either from the user directly or service providers?  Do you think that they should develop that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Do you think they have the ability to develop that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Professor, do you think that they have the ability to develop that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  It requires enormous resources and they probably, with the resources they currently have, I think it's likely that they don't have the ability...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  One thing Congress has.  We may not be Internet experts, but we have resources.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  Right.  And I think this is a soluble problem.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Weitzner?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  I think that they certainly should have the resources. I think really the key question is whether they have the personnel. And I think it will take some time to build up a set of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Well, I understand it will take time, but do you think they can develop those resources?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  I think so, absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      OK.  So, Mr. Yoran, I want to ask you another question.  Do you think that all of us supporting the development of increased capability within the government can be a reasonable path forward, as opposing -- as opposed to either relying on third parties or making companies write new software or redesign systems?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Do you think that's a better approach?  OK.  </p><p>      And I assume, Mr. Sewell, you probably agree with that, too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I'd agree that we ought to spend more money, time, resources on the FBI and on local law enforcement...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And would Apple be willing to help them develop those capabilities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  We actively do participate in helping them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  So your answer would be yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  That we would -- we would participate in training.  We would...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And helping them develop those new capabilities.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  We -- what we can do is to help them understand our ecosystem.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  That's what we do on a daily basis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Right.  I'm not trying to trick you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  No, I'm not -- I'm not responding...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Yeah, OK.  </p><p>      So -- so, I guess -- I guess, then, your answer would be yes, you're willing to help us in conjunction with law enforcement and Congress to solve this problem.  </p><p>      Is that correct, Mr. Sewell?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I want to solve the problem just like everyone else.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And are you willing to work with law enforcement and Congress to do it?  Yes or no?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Congressman, we work with them every day.  Yes, of course...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Yes or no will work.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  ... of course, we are.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Yoran?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Professor Blaze?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  And Mr. Weitzner?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And now recognize Mr. Griffith from Virginia.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I greatly appreciate that.  </p><p>      My background -- I'm just a small college history major who then went into law.  And as a part of that, Mr. Sewell, I would have to ask, would you agree with me that it took in the history of mankind, it took us thousands of years to come up with the concept of civil liberties and that perhaps five-and-a-half years isn't such a long time to try to find a solution to this current issue.  </p><p>      And likewise, that it would be -- it was -- the answer was in the affirmative, for those who may not have heard that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  It was.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  And that it was lawyers who actually created the concept of individual liberty, and one that our country has been proud to be the leader in the world in promoting.  Would that also be true?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  That's very true, sir.  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  That being said, I was very pleased to hear in the answers to Ms. DeGette that all of you were willing to help us solve this problem, because there is no easy answer.  I liked the safety deposit box analogy.  </p><p>      Mr. Weitzner, thanks for (inaudible) that for me in your analysis.  </p><p>      But I would ask Mr. Sewell if there isn't some way, and again I can't do what you all do.  So I have to simplify it to my terms.  Is there some way that we can create the vault that the banks have with the safety deposit box in it, and then once you're inside of there, if you want that security -- because not everybody has a safety deposit box -- but if you want that security, that then there's a system of a dual, but separate keys with companies like yours or others holding one of the two keys, and then the individual holding the other key. And then having the ability to, with a proper search warrant, have law enforcement be able to get in.  </p><p>      Is there some -- I mean, I'm trying to break it down in to a concept I can understand, where I can then apply what we have determined over the course of the last several hundred years is the appropriate way to get at information.  And it's difficult in this electronic age.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  It is very difficult, Congressman, I agree.  We haven't figured out a way that we can create an access point.  And then create a set of locks that are reliable to protect access through that access point.    </p><p>      That's what we struggle with.  We can create an access point and we can create locks.  But the problem is that the keys to that lock will ultimately be available somewhere.  And if they're available anywhere, they can be accessed by both good guys and bad guys.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  So you would agree with Mr. Weitzner's position or his analysis, which I thought was accurate, is that the problem is we're not giving a key and a drill to one safety deposit box.  It's everybody in the bank who suddenly would have that information then open.    </p><p>      And I saw that you wanted to make a comment, Mr. Weitzner.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  I just want to, since this analogy seems to be working, you know, we don't put much stuff in our safe deposit boxes, right?  I mean, I actually don't have one, to be honest.  And I think that there's this core concern, back to your -- your civil liberties framework, that somehow we have a warrant-free zone that's going to take over the world.  </p><p>      I think that if you follow the safety deposit box analogy, what we know is that the information that's important to law enforcement exists in many places.  And I don't question that there will be sometimes when law enforcement can't get some piece of information it wants.  But I think what you're hearing from a number of us and from the technical community is that this information is very widely distributed, and much of it is accessible in one way or the other or inferable from information that's produced by other third parties.  </p><p>      And I think that part of the path forward is to really understand how to exploit that to the best extent possible in investigations so that we're not all focused on the hardest part of the problem.  Where the hardest part of the problem is what do you do if you have very strongly encrypted data -- can you ever get it?  It may not be the best place to look all the time because it may not always be available.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  And of course, historically, you were never able to get a hold of everything.    </p><p>      Dr. Blaze, you wanted to weigh in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  So, I just want to caution that the split-T (ph) design, as attractive as it sounds, was also at the core of the NSA-designed clipper chip, which was where we started over two decades ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRIFFITH</emphasis>:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>      Mr. Yoran, I've got to tell you, I did think your testimony -- and your written testimony in particular was enlightening in regard to the fact that if we do shut down the U.S. companies, then there may even be safe havens created by those companies that are not our friends, and are specifically our enemies.  And unfortunately, I wanted to ask a series of questions on that, but I see that my time has expired.  And so I am required to yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I welcome the -- looking at other panel members.  We have Ms. Brooks from Indiana, your five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I'd like to start out with a comment that was made in the first panel.  And I guess this is to Mr. Sewell, whether or not you can share with us.  </p><p>      Does Apple plan to use encryption in the cloud?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  We've made no such announcement.  I'm not sure where that statement came from.  But we've made no such announcement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  OK.  I understand you've made no such announcement, but is that being explored?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I think it would be irresponsible for me to come here and tell you that we are not even looking at that.  But we have made no announcement, no decision has been made.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And are these discussions helping inform Apple's decisions?  And are -- is Apple communicating with any law enforcement about that possibility?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  These discussions are enormously -- enormously helpful. And I'd be glad to go further into that.  I've learned some things today that I didn't know before.  So they're extremely important.  </p><p>      We are considering -- we are talking to people.  We are being very mindful of the environment in which we're operating.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And I have certainly seen, and I know that Apple and many companies have a whole set of policies and procedures on compliance with legal processes and so forth.  And so I assume that you have regular conversations with policy makers of law enforcement, whether it's FBI or other agencies on these policy issues.  </p><p>      Is that correct? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  That's very correct.  I interact with law enforcement at two very different levels.  One is a very operational level.  My team supports daily activities in response to lawful processes.  We work very closely on actual investigations.  I can mention at least two where we've recently found children who've been abducted.  We've been able to save lives, working directly with our colleagues in law enforcement.  </p><p>      So at that level, we have a very good relationship.  And I think that gets lost in the debate sometimes.  </p><p>      At the other side, I work at perhaps a different level.  I work directly with my counterpart at the FBI.  I work directly with the most senior people in the Department of Justice.  And I work with senior people in local law enforcement on exactly these policy issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  And I thank you and all the others for cooperating with law enforcement and working on these issues.  But it seems as if most recently, there have not been enough of -- enough of the discussions. Hence, that's why we're having these hearings and why we need to continue to have these hearings.    </p><p>      But I think that -- that we have to continue to have the dialogue on the policy while continuing to work on the actual cases, and recognize that -- that obviously technology companies have been tremendously helpful and we need them to be tremendously helpful in solving crimes and in preventing future crimes.   </p><p>      I mean, it's not just about solving crimes already perpetrated, but it's always, particularly with respect to terrorism, how do we ensure that we're keeping the country safe.    </p><p>      I'm curious with respect to a couple of questions with respect to legal hacking.  And what -- and the types of costs that are associated with legal hacking, as well as the personnel needed.  And since the newer designs of iPhones prevent the bypassing of the built-in encryption, does Apple actually believe that lawful hacking is an appropriate method for investigators to use to assess the evidence in investigations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  So, I don't think we have a firm position on that.  I think there are questions that would have to be answered with respect to what the outcome of that lawful hacking is; what happens to the product of that lawful hacking.  </p><p>      So I don't have a formal corporate position on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  But so then because that has been promoted, so to speak, as far as a way around this difficult issue, are you having those policy discussions about Apple's view and the technology sector's view on lawful hacking?  Are those discussions happening with law enforcement?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I think this is a very nascent area for us.  But particularly the question is what happens to the result.  Does it get disclosed?  Does it not get disclosed?  That I think is an issue that has not been well explored.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  Mr. Yoran, do you have an opinion on lawful hacking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Not an opinion on lawful hacking in specific.  But I would just point out that doing encryption properly is very, very hard.  Trying to keep information secret in the incredibly interconnected world that we live in is very, very hard.  And I would suggest that it's getting harder, not easier.  </p><p>      So the -- the information, the data that law enforcement has access to I think is certainly much more than the metadata that they've had over the last several years.  But now as applications go into the cloud, those cloud application providers need to access the data.  </p><p>      So the sensitive information is not just on your iPhone or other device, it's sitting in the cloud, and law enforcement has access there because it cannot be encrypted.  It needs to be accessed by the cloud provider in order to do the sophisticated processing and provide the insight to the consumer that they're looking for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROOKS</emphasis>:  My time has expired.  I have to yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And now seeing no other members of the subcommittee that are with us, we can then go to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNKNOWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman?  I'm sorry.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  You're on the subcommittee?  OK.  We're going now to the -- none on the subcommittee, so now we're going to members that have been given privileges to speak.  And I was advised I was to go to the other side, like a ping-pong game.  And Ms. Eshoo from California, your five minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      First of all, to Mr. Yoran, I love your suit and tie.    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  It brings a little of the flavor of my district into this big old hearing room.  And warm welcome to your mother.  I don't know where she is, but it's great to have your mother here.  Great. Wonderful.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I know that Associate Professor Blaze talked about the crisis of the vulnerability in our country relative to, you know, how our systems -- how vulnerable our systems are.  I would just like to add for the record that up to 90 percent of the breaches in our system in our country are due to two major factors.  One is systems that are less than hygiene -- unhygienic systems.  Number two, very poor security management.  </p><p>      So I think the Congress should come up with at least a floor relative to standards.  And so that we can move that word \"crisis\" away from this.  But we really can do something about that.  I know it costs money to keep systems up and there are some that don't invest in it.  But that can be addressed.  </p><p>      The word \"conversation\" has been used, and I think very appropriately.  And this is a very healthy hearing.  Unfortunately, the first thing the American people heard was a very powerful federal agency on the -- you know, within moments of the tragedy in San Bernardino, demand of a private company that they must do thus and so; otherwise, we will be forever pitted against one another, and there is no other resolution except what I call a swinging door that people can go in and out of.  </p><p>      When I say \"people,\" in this case, it's the government.  Now, the American people have a health suspicion of big brother.  But they also have a healthy suspicion of big corporations.  They just do.  It's in our DNA.  And I don't think that's an unhealthy thing.  </p><p>      But that first snapshot I think we need to move to the next set of pictures on this.  And I'm heartened that the panel seems to be unanimous that this weakening of our overall system by having a backdoor, by having a swinging door is not the way to go.  </p><p>      So, in going past that, I'd like to ask Mr. Sewell the following. Whether introducing the third-party access, and that's been talked about -- I think that would fundamentally weaken our security.  How does third-party access impact security?  How likely do you think it is that law enforcement could design a system to address encrypted data that would not carry with it the unanticipated weaknesses of its own?  </p><p>      I'm worried about law enforcement in this.  And I want to put this on the record as well.  I think that it says something that the FBI didn't know what it was doing when it got a hold of that phone. And that's not good for us.  It's not going to attract smart young people to come into a federal agency because what it says to them is they don't know what -- it doesn't seem to us they know what they're doing.   </p><p>      So can you address this third-party access and what kind of effect it would have on overall security?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Thank  you very much for the question, Congressman.  </p><p>      If you allow third-party access, you have to give the third party a portal in which to exercise that access.  This is fundamentally the definition of a back door or a swinging door, as you've I think very aptly described it.    </p><p>      There is no way that we know of to create that vulnerability; to create that access point and more particularly to maintain it.  This was the issue in San Bernardino, was not just give us an access point, but maintain that access point in perpetuity so that we can get in over and over and over again.  </p><p>      That, for us -- we have no way of doing that without undermining and endangering the entire encryption infrastructure.  We believe that strong ubiquitous encryption is the best way that we can maintain the safety, security and privacy of all of our users.  So that would be fundamentally a problem.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESHOO</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your legislative courtesy.  Again, thank you to the witnesses.  You have been, I think, most helpful.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I thank the witnesses, too.  I apologize.  I had to run out for a while, but I'd like to ask a few questions here and want to make sure -- follow-up.    </p><p>      So Mr. Sewell, we can all understand the benefits of strong encryption, whether it's keeping someone's own bank statement, financial records encrypted, so we don't have to worry about hackers there.  We all saw some pretty compelling testimony in the first (inaudible) about law enforcement, criminal activity, child predators, homicide, et cetera.  Based on your experience, what we heard today, can you acknowledge that the spread of default encryption does present a challenge for law enforcement?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I think it absolutely does.  And I would not suggest for a moment that law enforcement is overstating this -- this -- the same claim that has been made by other panelists.  I think the problem is that there's a fundamental disconnect between the way we see the world and the way law enforcement sees the world, and that's where I think we ought to be focusing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And what is that disconnect?  What is that two different world views?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  The disconnect has to do with the evolution of technology in society and the impact of that technology in society. What you have heard from our colleagues in law enforcement is that the context in which encryption occurs reduces the scope of useful data that they have access to.  This going dark problem.  But if you talk to technologists, we see the world in a very different way.  We see the impact of technology is actually a burgeoning of information.  We see that there's an abundance of information, and this will only increase exponentially as we move into a world where the internet of things becomes part of our reality.    </p><p>      So you hear on one side, we're going dark, and you hear on the other side, there's an abundance of information.  That circle needs to be squared, and the only way that I think we can do that is by cooperating and talking and engaging in the kind of activity that the Madam Degette was suggesting.  We need to work together so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  So let me bring this... </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  ... that we understand their perspective and they understand ours.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I appreciate that, but I'm not -- it's a very compelling argument you gave, but I have no idea what you just said.  So let me try and put this into terms that we can all talk about.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  We hear testimony from the first panel of child predators who are able to hide behind this invisible cloak.  A murder scene where they could have perhaps caught who did this.  We know that when it comes to crimes, there are those who just won't commit crimes because they have a good moral compass.  We have those who will commit them anyway because they have none.  We also have those who can be deterred because they think they might get caught.    </p><p>      And when it comes to other issues, such as terrorist acts, where you can get into a cell phone or something from someone who has committed an act, you know that you can find out if they're planning more and save other lives.  So what do you tell a family member who has had their child abused and assaulted in unspeakable forms?  What do you tell them about burgeoning technology?  I mean, tell me what comfort we can give someone about the future?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I think in situations like that, of course, they're tragic.  I'm not sure that there's anything which I or any one of us could say that would help to ease that pain.  On the other hand, we deal with this every day.  We deal with cases where children have been abducted.  We work directly with law enforcement to try to solve those crimes.  We had a 14-year-old girl from Pennsylvania just recently that was abducted by her captor.  We worked immediately with the FBI in order to use IP logs to identify the location where she had been stashed.  We were able to get feet on the ground within a matter of hours, find that woman, rescue her, and apprehend...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And that's good and I appreciate that.  But what about -- I look at this case, it was presented, though, when someone may have a lot of information hidden, and if they could get in there, whether it is child predators or it is a terrorist where we could try and prevent more harm.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  And we're -- we're missing the point of technology, here.  The problems that we're trying to solve don't have an easy fix...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I know that, but tell me -- I need to know you're working in a direction that helps.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  That's what I'm trying to help you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Photo DNA, hashing images so that when those images move across the internet, we can identify them.  We can track them.  The work that we do with Operation Railroad is exactly that.  It's an example of taking technology, taking feet on the ground, law enforcement techniques and marrying them together in a way that fundamentally changes...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  And for people who are using encrypted sources, whether it's by default or intention, to hide their data and their intention and their harmful activity that they're planning on hurting more, what do we -- what do we tell the public about that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  We tell the public that fundamentally, we're working on the problem and that we believe strong ubiquitous encryption provides the best and safest...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  So does that mean Apple is going to be working with the FBI and law enforcement on this problem?  I know that the response of Apple was we ought to have a commission.  You're looking at the commission, the Energy and Commerce Committee, Oversight Investigation Committee, and we want to find solutions.  We want to work with you. And I'm pleased you're here today.    </p><p>      And you heard many of us say we don't think there's right or wrong absolutes.  This is not black and white.  We're all in this together and we want to work on that.  I need to know about your commitment, too, in working with law enforcement.  Could you make a statement on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Could I tell you a story, Congressman?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Can I actually do that?  I sat opposite my counterpart at the FBI, a person that I know very well.  We don't talk frequently, but we talk regularly.  We're on a first-name basis.  I sat opposite him and said amidst all this clamor and rancor, why don't we set aside a day?  We'll send some smart people to Washington or you send some smart people to Cupertino (ph) and what we'll do for that day is that we'll talk to you about what the world looks like from our perspective.  What is this explosion of data that we can see?  Why do we think it's so important?  And you talk to us about the world that confront your investigators from the moment they wake up in the morning.  How do they think about technology?  How do they think about the problems that they're trying to solve?    </p><p>      And we were going to sit down together for a day.  We were planning that at the time that the San Bernardino case was filed. That got put on hold.  But that offer still exists.  That's the way we're going to solve these problems.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Yes?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  Will you yield for one second?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  You know, Mr. Sewell, if -- if -- if we can facilitate that meeting in any way, I'm sure the chairman and I would be more than happy to do that and we have some very lovely conference rooms that are painted this very same color, courtesy of Chairman Upton, and we'll have you there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  Madam, if we can get out of the lawsuit world...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  You know what?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  ... let's start cooperating.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  You know what?  I'm -- that would be great.  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  We want that to be facilitated.  We have too many lives at stake and the concerns of many families and Americans.  This is -- this is central, this is core.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I agree.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  I know I'm out of time.    </p><p>      Mr. Bilirakis is recognized for five minutes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it so very much.  I want to thank everyone here on the panel for your technology leadership that helps us keep -- keeps us safe, because that's what our top priority here is in the United States Congress, at least it's mine and I know many others on this panel.  We're here to try to find a balance between security and privacy and not continue to pit them against each other.  I think you'll agree with that.    </p><p>      Mr. Yoran, how quickly does one life cycle of encryption last as a secure system until vulnerabilities are found and exploited?  Will this continually be a game of cat and mouse or are we at a level now where software and the processes are strong enough to make end-to-end encryption a stable system?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:  Systems are attacked and vulnerabilities are exploited almost instantaneously once computer systems, mobile devices are put on the internet.  Once crypto methods are published, there's an entire research community that goes to work.  Depending on the strength of the encryption, vulnerabilities may be discovered immediately or they may be discovered decades down the road, in which case all of the information may have been at risk while that crypto system was in use.   </p><p>      And frequently, the exposure and the exploitation of crypto systems isn't necessarily based on the strength of the algorithms themselves, but on how they're implemented and how the systems are interconnected.  I might not have the key to get information off of a particular device, but because I can break into the operating system because I have physical access to it, because I can read the chips, because I can do all sorts of different things, I can still get information or I can get the key while it as resonant in memory.  It's just a very complex system.  It all has to work perfectly in order for the information to be protected.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  All right.  Next question is for the entire panel.  We've known for the past few years that any significant threat to our homeland will likely include a cyberattack.  Will you agree on that?    </p><p>      Can you elaborate on the role that encryption plays in this process of continuing national security?  Certainly, the military has used forms of encryption for decades.  But can we -- can you give us a contemporary snapshot of how encryption used by government or non- government users protect us against cyberattacks today?  We can start over here, please.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEWELL</emphasis>:  I will answer the question, but I'm not at all the expert in this space.  I think the other panelists are much more expert than I am in the notion of encryption and protecting our infrastructure.  The one point that I will say that I tried to emphasize in my opening statement was that we shouldn't forget about some of the changes that are happening in terms of the way that infrastructure can be accessed.  I think we sometimes lose sight of the fact that phones themselves now are being used as authentication devices.    </p><p>      If you can break the encryption and get into the phone, that may be a very easy way to get into the power grid, to get into our transport systems, into our water systems.  So it's not just a question of the firewalls or the access.  It's how -- what is the instrumentality that you use to get into those things that we also have to be concerned about.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Yoran?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YORAN</emphasis>:   I believe fundamentally that security is actually on the same side as privacy and our economic interest.  It's fundamental -- it's fundamental in the national security community, but it's also mandated by law to protect all sorts of other data in other infrastructures and systems, such as financial services, health care records, so on and so forth, such that even folks who might not gain an advantage by having strong encryption available, like general -- I'm sorry -- Admiral Rogers, the director of the NSA, and James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, are on the record saying that they believe it's not in the U.S. best interests to weaken encryption.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Anyone else wish to comment?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLAZE</emphasis>:  I mean, encryption is used in protecting critical infrastructure the same way it's used in protecting other aspects of our -- of our society.  It protects sensitive data when it's being transmitted and stored, including on mobile devices and over the internet and so on.    </p><p>      I just want to add that critical infrastructure systems are largely based and built upon the same components that we're using in consumer and business devices as well.  There aren't -- you know, critical infrastructure systems essentially depend on mobile phones and operating systems that you and I are using in our day-to-day life. So when we weaken them, we also weaken the critical infrastructure systems.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Sir?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEITZNER</emphasis>:  Could I just add briefly that I actually thought Mr. Sewell's answer was pretty good.  But -- and what's critical about those systems that we rely on to protect our critical infrastructure is that when we find flaws in them, we have to patch them quickly, we have to fix them quickly.    </p><p>      As Mr. Yoran said, these systems are constantly being looked at. I'm concerned if we end up imposing requirements on our security infrastructure on our encryption tools, if we impose (inaudible) requirements, the process of identifying flaws, fixing them, putting out new versions rapidly, is going to be slowed down to figure out whether those comply with whatever the surveillance requirements are and I think that's the wrong direction for us to go in.    </p><p>      We want to make these tools as adaptive as possible.  We want them to be fixed as quickly as possible.  Not be caught in a whole set of rules about what they have to do and not do to accommodate surveillance needs.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BILIRAKIS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.    </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate. Appreciate it, and I'll yield back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from CTA be admitted to the record.  Without objection, that will be so.  </p><p>      And I believe -- Ms. Degette?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEGETTE</emphasis>:  I would ask unanimous consent, Ms. Eshoo has a letter from TechNet that's dated April 19 that we'd like to have put on the record.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      I would also ask unanimous consent that the contents of the document binder be introduced in the record and authorize staff to make any appropriate redactions.  Without objection, the documents will be entered into the record with any redactions the staff determines are appropriate.    </p><p>      And in conclusion, I want to thank all the witnesses and members that participated in today's hearing.  I remind members, they have 10 business days to submit questions for the record.  I ask that the witnesses all agree to respond promptly to the questions.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to hearing from you more and we'll get you together.    </p><p>      Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNKNOWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURPHY</emphasis>:  This committee is adjourned. </p><p>      END    </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JK4-SBB1-JDPT-T4MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  It's great to be here. Thank you so much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congratulations to you on all of your success. You are suing Google right now for $50 million.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Tell me what happened.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  During the first debate, and the hours that came after it, we were prepared with all of our Google ads. We were the most searched candidate and campaign of the night, when all of a sudden our Google ad account was shut down without any clear kind of explanation or how to get it back up. And it was later reinstated after that critical window had closed, again without any real explanation.  </p><p>      So we're suing Google really because of the power that these big tech monopolies have over influencing our public discourse, our freedom of speech, and really, ultimately, our fair elections, because if they can do this to me as a sitting member of Congress, running for the highest office of the land, this means they can do it to anyone running for office at any level in this country or any person if they don't like what you're saying.   </p><p>      And this is -- this is really not about me, it's really about the American people and about standing up for and protecting our freedom of speech. Whether we agree or disagree with that speech, this goes to the core and founding principles of our country. And they shouldn't have the power to be able to do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So what's the answer here? Because this is an issue I think that brings together both sides.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  It should.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz wanting a breakup of some of these companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And you see the president, obviously, he's also saying that he's watching Google closely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  These companies have more power today than they ever had. What do you want to see?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  How is this going to change?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Eighty-eight percent of all Internet searches in the United States take place in Google.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Ninety-two percent in the world. So when you look at -- at a monopoly like Google, having total control of what pops up when you -- when you search for something, this is what we're talking about. So I think there's two approaches that we need to take. One is to break up these big tech monopolies because that's exactly what they are, and also look legislatively at what kind of transparency oversight and accountability is put in place to make sure that there is not an infringement on our freedom of speech and to make sure things are fair and transparent.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  There's also a movement -- an upset about Google not working with the Pentagon because of the immigration policies and instead choosing to work with China and inadvertently helping the Chinese military. This is what Peter Thiel has been saying as well. Your thoughts on that, because it's more than just censoring people's opinions on things, it's also privatization breaches and this China situation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes, look, I think it's important for us, from our government and from our regulatory standpoint is to look at what's in the best interests of the American people, making sure that we're protecting those freedoms and our civil liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution and looking and making sure that our decisions are being made with our national security in the forefront.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Would you like to see legislation around this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I would.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK. A new Quinnipiac poll is out, it shows Joe Biden leading nationally among 2020 Democrats. You've got Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders following. You're polling at 1 percent, with Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar. Ten percent of voters are still undecided.  </p><p>      What are you going to do about this? How are you going to continue to resonate? You met your fundraising goals, right? I mean in order to get on that stage the next time --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Where are you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Well, we can see how -- how impactful these debates can be. And this is why it's important and we're continuing to build our support. We've gone way past the donor requirement, which is 130,000 individual donors to qualify for the next round of debates. And we're looking forward to the next round of polls that we hope to be able to meet that polling threshold as well.   </p><p>      But really what this comes down to is the work we are doing every day to reach out to voters, directly to voters across this country, let them know who I am, why I'm running for president, and why I'm the best qualified to serve them as president and commander in chief.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And why are you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Because of the experience that I bring. You know, as soldier, I've served now for over 16 years in the Army National Guard. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. And for nearly seven years in Congress have been very focused on national security. In serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and Homeland Security Committees, understanding the cost of war, the toll that it takes on our service members and their families, and the toll that it takes on every single American in this country when we look at the over $6 trillion, taxpayer dollars, that we've spent on these wasteful regime change wars since 9/11 alone, dollars that should have been and should be used in meeting the needs of the American people here at home.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So you want to take the troops, obviously, back from Afghanistan?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I want to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. It should have happened long ago. Right now, in Afghanistan, we are spending $4 billion every month. Four billion dollars. And when you look at folks in communities across the country who don't even have clean water to drink, when you look at the infrastructure needs in our country, when you look at the lack of affordable housing, there are so many things that we need to address. We've got to get our priorities straight and make sure that we are using our military for the function that they intend, which is to keep the American people safe, and investing our limited resources into empowering and serving the needs of our people.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You talk about all of the things that Americans need and yet when the Dems, including yourself, were on that stage and asked a question, \"Are you willing to give health care to illegals,\" you raised your hand?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I did not.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You do not --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I did not. I think it's important that we make -- that we fix our immigration system. I do support making sure that we've got quality health care for everyone who needs it, regardless of whether they're rich or whether they're poor. We should also make sure that we have a private insurance option for those who choose to pursue that.  </p><p>      But rather than putting a band aid on all of these different immigration challenges we are facing, we need to fix our immigration system, past comprehensive immigration reform so that we don't have 10 -- over 10 million undocumented people who are living in the shadows in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  These are the kinds of things that differentiate you from others on that stage, the fact that you understand that Americans should come first in terms of health care, as opposed to illegals. What do you want to do about immigration --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I -- I think that we should --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  These are the issues you think that are going to get you to that 2 percent threshold.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I think the -- I think it's a matter of looking at what's in the best interests of the people in this country. And reforming the broken laws that we have, including immigration laws, that are a disservice across the board, it's a disservice to people who are trying to seek asylum in this country, and it's a disservice to the American people and those who are trying to come into our country legally.   </p><p>      It's impacting our economy. There's a huge impact on our borders with inhumane conditions there. So we have to make sure that we are living up to the values that we represent, which is having a safe and secure border while having humane immigration policies that best serve our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So why is it that you and your colleagues in Congress have been unable to fix the loopholes? I mean this is the issue that is bringing all of these people from Central America --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  To the border, which shows (ph) the border --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  It's partisanship.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  It was incredible, the -- the children that I witnessed coming over the border alone, couldn't find their mother. So many stories, I can go on. What do you want to do about those loophole, the Flores agreement, the asylum standards? How come Congress has not been able to change these?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  It comes down to partisanship. That's the bottom line. People who are putting their own political interests ahead of the interests of the people and ahead of the interests of really bringing about solutions to these challenges that we've faced for a long time and that are only getting worse because of that inaction.   </p><p>      I've worked in a bipartisan way on many different issues in Congress. There's great opportunity there. We need strong leaderships willing to put people ahead of party so we can get the job done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  For a long time, Nancy Pelosi and many of your colleagues on the left were saying it's not a crisis. It was a manufactured crisis. Now they're, obviously, seeing that that's a different story. In fact I think after our border trip and what we witnessed, while we were live on air, there was a pivot. I think the -- I think that the tone changed because it was so obvious. But why -- I mean you see it as a crisis, correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I do. I have. Again, I think this is important for us to move past the partisan politics and for us to come together as a country to say, we need to solve this problem, both for what's happening at the border, but also, what is driving these people to walk thousands of miles --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  -- to leave their homes, put their lives and their children's lives at risk and reform our entire immigration system.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You've got a great grip on the issues at hand and what's important to the American people, but you've got to be here. You are hosting a town hall in New Hampshire today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Then you're set to take two weeks off to serve in the National Guard. Are you worried that you're going to be out of the loop? You've got to be in the faces and, you know, in people's faces to resonate, to make sure they understand where you stand on these issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I'm grateful to have the privilege of being able to serve our country. So I'm not putting anything aside to be able to go and serve my country. I will continue that service as I am on this campaign. This time it's going to be in uniform for a couple of weeks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, thank you for your service to our country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  We all appreciate it, I know in this building and our viewers as well. You tweeted about Kamala Harris yesterday. I want to ask you about that, you know, takedown, if you will, on the debate stage. Kamala's entire campaign is based on a lie, you wrote, \"That as the AG of California, she was a fighter for the oppressed and for criminal justice reform, but her criminal justice record shows that her policies exemplified the worst aspects of our criminal justice system.\"  </p><p>      The two of you had that heated back-and-forth during the last debate. Tell me what you want people to understand about Kamala Harris.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  This comes down to leadership. You know, what kind of leadership is -- would she bring and what kind of leader was she as attorney general in California. And it's pointing to the truth and the facts. She claims to be very proud of the record that she had, as the attorney general in California.   </p><p>      I pointed out some of the huge problems with the kind of leadership that she brought where she claims to be a champion for the people, but instead made decisions that caused more harm, hardship and suffering for people in California. And I gave some of those examples in the debate.   </p><p>      She needs to answer to the American people on these facts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congresswoman, it's great to have you this morning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thanks so much. Tulsi Gabbard joining us there. We'll be watching you, Congresswoman. Thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS3-MPC1-F15W-H163-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS      INTERVIEWED ON FOX BUSINESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUGUST 7, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Hawaii Congresswoman, 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate, Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congresswoman, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's great to be here. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO:  Congratulations to you on all of your success. You are suing Google right now for $50 million.</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me what happened.</p><p>GABBARD:  During the first debate, and the hours that came after it, we were prepared with all of our Google ads. We were the most searched candidate and campaign of the night, when all of a sudden our Google ad account was shut down without any clear kind of explanation or how to get it back up. And it was later reinstated after that critical window had closed, again without any real explanation.</p><p>So we're suing Google really because of the power that these big tech monopolies have over influencing our public discourse, our freedom of speech, and really, ultimately, our fair elections, because if they can do this to me as a sitting member of Congress, running for the highest office of the land, this means they can do it to anyone running for office at any level in this country or any person if they don't like what you're saying.</p><p>And this is -- this is really not about me, it's really about the American people and about standing up for and protecting our freedom of speech. Whether we agree or disagree with that speech, this goes to the core and founding principles of our country. And they shouldn't have the power to be able to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's the answer here? Because this is an issue I think that brings together both sides.</p><p>GABBARD:  It should.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz wanting a breakup of some of these companies.</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you see the president, obviously, he's also saying that he's watching Google closely.</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These companies have more power today than they ever had. What do you want to see?</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is this going to change?</p><p>GABBARD:  Eighty-eight percent of all Internet searches in the United States take place in Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>GABBARD:  Ninety-two percent in the world. So when you look at -- at a monopoly like Google, having total control of what pops up when you -- when you search for something, this is what we're talking about. So I think there's two approaches that we need to take. One is to break up these big tech monopolies because that's exactly what they are, and also look legislatively at what kind of transparency oversight and accountability is put in place to make sure that there is not an infringement on our freedom of speech and to make sure things are fair and transparent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's also a movement -- an upset about Google not working with the Pentagon because of the immigration policies and instead choosing to work with China and inadvertently helping the Chinese military. This is what Peter Thiel has been saying as well. Your thoughts on that, because it's more than just censoring people's opinions on things, it's also privatization breaches and this China situation.</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes. Yes, look, I think it's important for us, from our government and from our regulatory standpoint is to look at what's in the best interests of the American people, making sure that we're protecting those freedoms and our civil liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution and looking and making sure that our decisions are being made with our national security in the forefront.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you like to see legislation around this?</p><p>GABBARD:  I would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK. A new Quinnipiac poll is out, it shows Joe Biden leading nationally among 2020 Democrats. You've got Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders following. You're polling at 1 percent, with Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar. Ten percent of voters are still undecided.</p><p>What are you going to do about this? How are you going to continue to resonate? You met your fundraising goals, right? I mean in order to get on that stage the next time --</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are you?</p><p>GABBARD:  Well, we can see how -- how impactful these debates can be. And this is why it's important and we're continuing to build our support. We've gone way past the donor requirement, which is 130,000 individual donors to qualify for the next round of debates. And we're looking forward to the next round of polls that we hope to be able to meet that polling threshold as well.</p><p>But really what this comes down to is the work we are doing every day to reach out to voters, directly to voters across this country, let them know who I am, why I'm running for president, and why I'm the best qualified to serve them as president and commander in chief.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why are you?</p><p>GABBARD:  Because of the experience that I bring. You know, as soldier, I've served now for over 16 years in the Army National Guard. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. And for nearly seven years in Congress have been very focused on national security. In serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and Homeland Security Committees, understanding the cost of war, the toll that it takes on our service members and their families, and the toll that it takes on every single American in this country when we look at the over $6 trillion, taxpayer dollars, that we've spent on these wasteful regime change wars since 9/11 alone, dollars that should have been and should be used in meeting the needs of the American people here at home.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to take the troops, obviously, back from Afghanistan?</p><p>GABBARD:  I want to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. It should have happened long ago. Right now, in Afghanistan, we are spending $4 billion every month. Four billion dollars. And when you look at folks in communities across the country who don't even have clean water to drink, when you look at the infrastructure needs in our country, when you look at the lack of affordable housing, there are so many things that we need to address. We've got to get our priorities straight and make sure that we are using our military for the function that they intend, which is to keep the American people safe, and investing our limited resources into empowering and serving the needs of our people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You talk about all of the things that Americans need and yet when the Dems, including yourself, were on that stage and asked a question, \"Are you willing to give health care to illegals,\" you raised your hand?</p><p>GABBARD:  I did not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do not --</p><p>GABBARD:  I did not. I think it's important that we make -- that we fix our immigration system. I do support making sure that we've got quality health care for everyone who needs it, regardless of whether they're rich or whether they're poor. We should also make sure that we have a private insurance option for those who choose to pursue that.</p><p>But rather than putting a band aid on all of these different immigration challenges we are facing, we need to fix our immigration system, past comprehensive immigration reform so that we don't have 10 -- over 10 million undocumented people who are living in the shadows in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are the kinds of things that differentiate you from others on that stage, the fact that you understand that Americans should come first in terms of health care, as opposed to illegals. What do you want to do about immigration --</p><p>GABBARD:  I -- I think that we should --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are the issues you think that are going to get you to that 2 percent threshold.</p><p>GABBARD:  I think the -- I think it's a matter of looking at what's in the best interests of the people in this country. And reforming the broken laws that we have, including immigration laws, that are a disservice across the board, it's a disservice to people who are trying to seek asylum in this country, and it's a disservice to the American people and those who are trying to come into our country legally.</p><p>It's impacting our economy. There's a huge impact on our borders with inhumane conditions there. So we have to make sure that we are living up to the values that we represent, which is having a safe and secure border while having humane immigration policies that best serve our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why is it that you and your colleagues in Congress have been unable to fix the loopholes? I mean this is the issue that is bringing all of these people from Central America --</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To the border, which shows (ph) the border --</p><p>GABBARD:  It's partisanship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was incredible, the -- the children that I witnessed coming over the border alone, couldn't find their mother. So many stories, I can go on. What do you want to do about those loophole, the Flores agreement, the asylum standards? How come Congress has not been able to change these?</p><p>GABBARD:  It comes down to partisanship. That's the bottom line. People who are putting their own political interests ahead of the interests of the people and ahead of the interests of really bringing about solutions to these challenges that we've faced for a long time and that are only getting worse because of that inaction.</p><p>I've worked in a bipartisan way on many different issues in Congress. There's great opportunity there. We need strong leaderships willing to put people ahead of party so we can get the job done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a long time, Nancy Pelosi and many of your colleagues on the left were saying it's not a crisis. It was a manufactured crisis. Now they're, obviously, seeing that that's a different story. In fact I think after our border trip and what we witnessed, while we were live on air, there was a pivot. I think the -- I think that the tone changed because it was so obvious. But why -- I mean you see it as a crisis, correct?</p><p>GABBARD:  I do. I have. Again, I think this is important for us to move past the partisan politics and for us to come together as a country to say, we need to solve this problem, both for what's happening at the border, but also, what is driving these people to walk thousands of miles --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>GABBARD:  -- to leave their homes, put their lives and their children's lives at risk and reform our entire immigration system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got a great grip on the issues at hand and what's important to the American people, but you've got to be here. You are hosting a town hall in New Hampshire today.</p><p>GABBARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then you're set to take two weeks off to serve in the National Guard. Are you worried that you're going to be out of the loop? You've got to be in the faces and, you know, in people's faces to resonate, to make sure they understand where you stand on these issues.</p><p>GABBARD:  I'm grateful to have the privilege of being able to serve our country. So I'm not putting anything aside to be able to go and serve my country. I will continue that service as I am on this campaign. This time it's going to be in uniform for a couple of weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you for your service to our country.</p><p>GABBARD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We all appreciate it, I know in this building and our viewers as well. You tweeted about Kamala Harris yesterday. I want to ask you about that, you know, takedown, if you will, on the debate stage. Kamala's entire campaign is based on a lie, you wrote, \"That as the AG of California, she was a fighter for the oppressed and for criminal justice reform, but her criminal justice record shows that her policies exemplified the worst aspects of our criminal justice system.\"</p><p>The two of you had that heated back-and-forth during the last debate. Tell me what you want people to understand about Kamala Harris.</p><p>GABBARD:  This comes down to leadership. You know, what kind of leadership is -- would she bring and what kind of leader was she as attorney general in California. And it's pointing to the truth and the facts. She claims to be very proud of the record that she had, as the attorney general in California.</p><p>I pointed out some of the huge problems with the kind of leadership that she brought where she claims to be a champion for the people, but instead made decisions that caused more harm, hardship and suffering for people in California. And I gave some of those examples in the debate.</p><p>She needs to answer to the American people on these facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, it's great to have you this morning.</p><p>GABBARD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much. Tulsi Gabbard joining us there. We'll be watching you, Congresswoman. Thank you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2268993033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-XGD1-JBHT-D4R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2132\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Aug 7, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told CNBC in an interview. Blackburn introduced the bill along with Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Section 230 was enacted in the 1990s to protect tech platforms from being held liable for their users' content and allow them to engage in good faith content moderation. But in recent years, it's come under bipartisan scrutiny.  Three top Republicans are seeking to limit a liability shield for tech platforms while maintaining some key protections through a new bill that would reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .   The Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Ac t aims to maintain the key provisions of Section 230 that would allow platforms to keep operating openly while limiting the types of content they could moderate if they wish to maintain their liability exemption. The bill was introduced by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Judiciary Committee Tech Task Force leader Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn.   \"We do think that it is important that there be a revisit and not a repeal of Section 230,\" said Blackburn, who sits on both the Commerce and Judiciary Committees, in a phone interview with CNBC on Wednesday. Blackburn said the modern internet is not the same as that which existed at the time of Section 230's creation, saying tech companies are no longer in their \"infancy.\"   Section 230 was enacted in the 1990s to protect tech platforms from being held liable for their users' content. It also allowed platforms in the burgeoning tech industry to engage in good faith content moderation without taking on responsibility for their users' posts.   It is considered to be one of the key pillars of the modern internet. The tech industry has long held that Section 230 is what enables players like Facebook and Google  to continue running their businesses without fearing a deluge of costly, petty lawsuits. The law is even more important to smaller tech start-ups, larger platforms argue, that can't bear the cost of such legal expenses.   But in recent years, Section 230 has garnered criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike who believe its protections are now outdated as tech platforms have grown to become some of the most valuable companies in the world. The law has also become a target for President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order this summer directing the Federal Communications Commission to create new rules on Section 230 protections and the Federal Trade Commission to take action against companies engaging in \"deceptive\" acts of communication. The order, however, has little power without action from Congress.   The new Republican bill would primarily revise three aspects of Section 230:  It would narrow the scope of the types of content that tech platforms could not be prosecuted for removing. Currently under Section 230, platforms have a long leash to limit the reach and availability of any \"material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\" But under the new bill, \"otherwise objectionable\" would be replaced with specific categories of content that is \"promoting self-harm, promoting terrorism, or unlawful.\" It would seek to remove subjective judgement by tech platforms on what types of content falls into these buckets by replacing the standard of what the platform \"considers to be\" objectionable to what it \"has an objectively reasonable belief is.\" It clarifies the definition of an \"information content provider\" as any person or entity that \"editorializes or affirmatively and substantively modifies the content of another person or entity\" besides cosmetic changes to the format or layout of the content. That could deny 230 protections to platforms that delete user comments that are not covered by the Good Samaritan clause, for example.  Blackburn said the reasonableness standard and more specific language is meant in part to address bias in content moderation. Blackburn and other conservatives have repeatedly accused tech companies of building biased algorithms or employing moderators whose choices reflect their own leanings. While tech companies have apologized for several incidents in which content was mistakenly or unfairly removed, they've held that their moderation practices are consistent with their policies.   \"We know that there are not going to be other alternatives to these platforms until we get these liability protections brought up to date, and we also think that there is not going to be accountability for bias until we get this brought up to date,\" Blackburn said.   But narrowing the scope of what can be considered \"objectionable\" content could make it more risky for tech platforms to remove borderline content or content that falls into a gray area of the law. For example, while there are laws that prevent companies from promoting products with false health claims, they likely wouldn't prevent a celebrity from sharing provably bogus health information that could pose a danger to their followers. While unforeseen circumstances can always happen, Blackburn said the categories in her bill would cover much of the harmful content shared online.   \"Through the growth, development, evolution of the online space, is it conceivable that something else at a future date would be added? Of course,\" Blackburn said. \"What this does is take away the generality and putting in its place something specific because one of the objections that we've heard regularly and one of the shields that Big Tech would use is to say, 'Well, our content moderators considered this to be objectionable.' So to begin to put some language in place that is more definitive is, I think, a step in the right direction.\"   Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of the tech industry group NetChoice, said the bill would prevent tech platforms from removing exactly the type of content Congress has warned them about.   \"This bill would thwart social media's ability to remove Russian or Chinese election interference campaigns, misinformation about Covid-19, and cyberbullying from their services,\" said Szabo, whose members include Amazon , Facebook, Google , TikTok and Twitter . \"Furthermore, the bill would prevent online services from removing the very content Congress demands they remove \u2013 notably medical misinformation and efforts to undermine our elections.\"   Blackburn brushed off such criticisms from the industry as nitpicking. She said much of content people would worry about would fall under the terms included in the bill and said her focus was on bringing a bill that would revise Section 230 without repealing it.   \"What I was seeking to do is to modify this and bring it to a point that we can get agreement and we can reform and not repeal because our innovators in this space are still going to need Section 230 protections,\" Blackburn said, highlighting the need to give new innovators opportunities to benefit from protections that give them a chance to compete with the dominant players.   But such specificity could prevent many Democrats from getting on board with the bill, which is notably missing any Democratic co-sponsors. While Blackburn said she's confident it will receive bipartisan and bicameral support, Democrats have pressed tech platforms throughout the election cycle to apply more fact-checks on medical misinformation and misleading election content and have shrugged at accusations of bias.   Several other bills reforming Section 230 have been introduced or are in the works. Graham introduced a separate bill, the EARN IT Act, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., which would tie the liability protections to efforts to report child sexual abuse material. Industry critics claimed the bill would undermine encryption  that protects users' privacy, but the bill passed in the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote in July with amendments that watered down, but failed to eliminate , some of their concerns.

The event  hosted by our sister network, the Fox News channel. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's the final GOP debate before the Iowa caucuses this upcoming Monday.   Frontrunner, Donald Trump says he still won't participate in tonight's  event. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He went on the \"O'REILLY FACTOR\" last night to explain his decision. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS:  I -- </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, CHAIRMAN &amp; PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS &amp; FOUNDER, TRUMP  ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS:  Right -- </p><p>O'REILLY:  Submit to you that you need to change and get away from the  personal -- they hurt my feelings, are unfair to me.</p><p>And they get about them, the folks, not about you.  And you elevate them to  a place where you could win this if you do that.  Am I crazy? </p><p>TRUMP:  You're not crazy at all, but it is about them, it's about making  America great again.</p><p>That's why I'm doing this.  It's not because I want the position, it's  because I know the potential of this country, how great the country can be.</p><p>Our leader is not doing the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in tonight for the Fox News-Google debate,  beginning at 7:00 p.m. Eastern on the Fox News channel.</p><p>Let's look at markets right here.  Futures pointing to modest gains at the  opening of trading.</p><p>Take a look, we've been back and forth between positive and negative  territories this morning, we are expecting a higher opening for the Dow  about 40 points high.</p><p>Nasdaq looking good, up 33 points, of course the Federal Reserve yesterday  raised questions about the next time it will be able to raise interest  rates.</p><p>Same with the economy did in fact slowdown at the end of last year.  In  Europe, markets are lower this morning across the board.</p><p>Take a look, down between two-thirds of 1 percent and one and a third  percent.  The Dax index in Germany down.</p><p>Hundred and thirty five points right now, that's the low of the morning,  down better than 1 percent.  And in Asia overnight, tough night in China.</p><p>The Shanghai composite down nearly 3 percent on the session, that set the  tone.  The Nikkei average down three-quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>Facebook, the stock to watch today.  The social media giant handily beating  earnings expectations.</p><p>Revenue soared better than 50 percent in the fourth quarter from a year  earlier, driven by mobile advertising.</p><p>The stock jumping in the pre-market this morning, Facebook up sharply right  now.  Growing concern this morning about the Zika virus. </p><p>The United Nations is holding an emergency meeting on Monday to determine  whether the virus  should be deemed an international health emergency. </p><p>This as new cases of the Zika virus confirmed in the United States just  this morning.  There are now at least six cases including New York. </p><p>Republican presidential candidates getting ready to face off tonight in the  Fox News debate in Iowa. </p><p>The last GOP debate before Monday's Iowa caucuses.  Blake Burman is in Des  Moines right now with the preview of what to expect tonight.  Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there, Maria, good morning to you.  Donald  Trump continues to maintain steadfastly that he will not be here at the Fox  News debate tonight, later tonight here in Des Moines.</p><p>This is still an incredibly important debate for so many different reasons.   Not only is it the final debate in the lead up until the Iowa caucuses on  Monday night.</p><p>But also the first debate here in Iowa as well, over the issues for Iowa  voters will be front and center.</p><p>There will be 11 other candidates here guaranteed later tonight.  The 9:00  debate has seven candidates on that stage.</p><p>Cruz and Rubio will be front and center, they'll be flanked by Carson and  Bush, Christie and Kasich, and Rand Paul makes his return to the 9:00  debate stage.</p><p>But this all kicks off at 7:00 with four candidates: Fiorina, Huckabee and  Santorum.  Jim Gilmore also returns to this debate. </p><p>I was speaking with an adviser yesterday of Ted Cruz, and that adviser told  me that his campaign feels that Cruz will be the one receiving the cross- fire now.</p><p>Because if Trump isn't there, they say, you know what? People shoot up in  these debates, Cruz is running second in the polls, they expect their guy  to get a lot of the heat tonight.  </p><p>Still, they told me, Maria, Donald Trump will not going to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  But at the end of the day, it's not really the  Donald who is afraid of Megyn.</p><p>It's not that he's afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush.  It's not that he's  afraid of me.  He's afraid of you.</p><p>He doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about  how his record doesn't match what he's selling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Things still look good for Trump here.  A new \"Wall Street  Journal\" poll out this morning shows he has 32 percent support from Iowa  caucus, though rose at 7 points ahead of Cruz, Rubio comes in at 18 as  well.  </p><p>That poll also shows in the other early states of New Hampshire and South  Carolina that Trump lead big.  Maria, back to to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thanks so much Blake Burman.  And joining us  right now is former Senate Majority leader George Mitchell and former RNC  chairman and former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.</p><p>Good to see you both gentlemen, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>GEORGE MITCHELL, FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  Thank you, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, let me kick this off with you.  What's your take on  what's going on right now?</p><p>Is Trump not showing up tonight, is that going to be good for him or do you  think he loses in this?</p><p>MITCHELL:  I think it's probably not good for him, the more important  question is, will it derail his efforts in it, I doubt that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it won't be good for him, but it won't derail him either?</p><p>MITCHELL:  No, I don't think it would.  Ted Cruz himself said, I think it  was yesterday that, if Trump wins Iowa and then goes on to win New  Hampshire which proves likely, he'll be unstoppable.</p><p>And on that I think Senator Cruz may be right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, governor, what do you think? </p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR:  Well, obviously, Trump thinks  it's good for him or he wouldn't be doing it.  </p><p>This is -- I don't think this is about his feelings being hurt.  I think he  made the calculation he's got more to lose by being in the debate than not  being in the debate. </p><p>But we'll see.  He's -- if the polling is to be believed, he's got a solid  lead in both of these states. </p><p>I don't think anybody has got it in the bag.  I don't think the idea that  somebody is inevitable if they win both these debates is accurate, but I  guess, he gets a mighty powerful momentum --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  If he wins both of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is a really good point.  But let me ask you about  what he said about you governor, because he was asked about you with George  Stephanopoulos.</p><p>And he said, look, Haley Barbour, he's an old-time politician, he's been up  in my office looking for money many times, Trump says.</p><p>He's an old-time politician who is losing his grip.  Frankly, I haven't  heard the name Haley Barbour ever mentioned in a year and a half, and the  reason that me and Ted Cruz are in the lead is because of that. </p><p>What do you think about this governor? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, he's certainly right that I'm old.  But the fact is, George  Stephanopoulos, the next day apologized for telling Donald Trump that I had  said something about him that I didn't say. </p><p>In fact, I hadn't said anything about him.  I've only met the guy twice in  my life and one time he took me to a heavyweight championship fight in  Atlantic City when I was RNC chairman back in the -- back in the '90s. </p><p>I've stayed out of this just like I did in 2008 and 2012 as a former  national party chairman. </p><p>That's what I have intended to do and I've done it again.  I'm going to  support the nominee of the party, because I don't think our country can  stay four more years with Obama's policies.</p><p>And that's what we'll get if we elect Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.   But that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>I'm going to follow Reagan's 11th commandment, I was a political director  to (INAUDIBLE) and Ronald Reagan, that's what he preached and practiced.</p><p>And that's what I start to practice -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  Stephanopoulos apologized because basically  he was starting this thing between the two of you, and you didn't even say  anything. </p><p>It was actually -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  That is right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Henry Barbour, the former -- your nephew and -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  That's exactly right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A Republican strategist, so he said it, he brings up your name  as if you said it, and Trump lashes at you for no reason. </p><p>But Senator Mitchell -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  OK -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea that Bernie Sanders is in the lead in Iowa on the Dem  side and Trump is in the lead on the Republican side. </p><p>What does it say about our country right now? </p><p>MITCHELL:  Well, I think there's a lot of frustration, anger, that happens  whenever the economy turns down.</p><p>The President who campaigns provide an outlet for frustration that people  feel.  Particularly those who aren't moving up in the new economy. </p><p>We figured out a way to encourage innovation, we have the technological  revolutions which we're now passing.</p><p>We'll be seeing in the future as important in human affairs as it was the  industrial revolution.</p><p>But we haven't figured out how to replace the jobs that had been lost.   What I call the working man middle income jobs. </p><p>Factory worker who could support a wife and two children.  And that  frustration will continue for a long time and it's finding its expression  now in the presidential campaign on both sides. </p><p>But I think you're going to see a closely contested election in the general  election.  The country is pretty much divided. </p><p>The parties, well, I think generally unite, you heard Hillary say he'll  support whoever the nominee is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>MITCHELL:  And an interesting way, Trump is the nominee will help the  Democrats unite and Secretary Clinton as the Democratic nominee will help  the Republicans unite.</p><p>So, although, history isn't much of a guide in this election, history tells  us that you can have a hotly contested nominee processes and still find the  parties coming together. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised Bernie Sanders is beating Hillary in Iowa? </p><p>MITCHELL:  No, I think that he's beating Hillary in the polls, and as you  see from the poll results, it's overwhelmingly among young people.</p><p>The question still is whether they will turn out to vote.  But I think once  you get past New Hampshire, he isn't in his favorable territory as he is in  these first two states. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, what about you? You know, you've been the chairman of  the RNC, what do you think in terms of how this plays out next several  months? </p><p>How important is Iowa followed by New Hampshire? What are the other states  that you think will really give us a sense of who in fact people are voting  for? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, when you go down to the south, you'll see if you get  different results, but I'm not sure that you will. </p><p>But I think George Mitchell makes very important points.  The country is  very evenly divided.</p><p>But there's so much polarity.  There's so much division and it is because  as he said, people in our country are dissatisfied.</p><p>And it's not the right or the left, it's both.  You see it in both parties,  and it's because nearly two-thirds of Americans think that the country is  going in the wrong direction.</p><p>And that you thought that for two or three years.  This is not some  phenomenon because something bad happened last week or last month or last  quarter. </p><p>People have been very dissatisfied about the economy, about national  security, about so many things that it's manifesting now that people say,  you know, that they're mad at everybody in Washington.</p><p>Hence Bernie Sanders, hence Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, both parties though.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, who do you think has the best plan to fix some of these  things then? I mean, you know, Senator Mitchell is talking about  automation, technology displacing people.</p><p>Obviously wages haven't moved.  There are a lot of issues that are  upsetting people.</p><p>BARBOUR:  And very rarely is that talked about in the news coverage.   Mostly, it's about personality, it's about polling, it's about tactics.</p><p>We need more of the debate to be about.  Here is the problem, here is my  plan to fix the problem, and frankly, the candidates that talked the most  about that, Kasich and Bush and Christie on our side, they get the least  coverage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Donald Trump gets ten times more coverage than everybody else  combined without ever really talking about anything and any detail.</p><p>And I'm not criticizing, that's just the fact. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Public use very little about the issues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but to be fair, I mean, in our debates that we've done  here at the Fox Business Network, we stuck to the issues, we got a chance  to really talk about tax reform.</p><p>Did you hear anything that you feel would resonate with people, senator?</p><p>MITCHELL:  Well, it's very difficult in the current campaign mode,  particularly these debates.  </p><p>No criticism of anybody when you got a dozen people up on the stage and you  got 30 or 60 seconds to answer a question.</p><p>It's conducive to bumper stickers, slogans and superficial statements -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  If you get up and make a reasonable statement, you'll never get  on the television news or get in the newspapers.</p><p>Could I just add one point then, not to disagree with Haley, the feeling of  dissatisfaction goes back a lot longer than two or three years.</p><p>You'll recall in 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had a very difficult economic  circumstance.  </p><p>We were losing 400,000 jobs a month at the -- at the bottom of the  recession in which we dropped and there was enormous dissatisfaction then.</p><p>Since then, it's come back some in the President's term, 15 million new  jobs have been created.  </p><p>We have the strongest economy in the world by far, how it's relative and  turning to -- and Russia have far more serious problems than we do.</p><p>But we still have serious issues that we have not been able to overcome,  that will take a unified effort.</p><p>And one of the long term disadvantages of these polarizing campaigns is  that it's hard to get people working together again after the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  When we really need to pull together to try to solve some of the  long range issues that are not attributable to one party or the other, to  one president or another. </p><p>But really are attributable to underlying economic, social and cultural  forces that are affecting not just the people of this country, but people  all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess governor, as you said, people are frustrated that  we're not farther along. </p><p>I mean, you're right, the financial crisis in 2008 is where this feelings  started.</p><p>But they're looking in the last 7 years and saying, my wages haven't moved,  my situation hasn't changed much.</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, the recovery has been the weakest since World War II about  2.2 percent a year economic growth which is about half as much growth per  year as after the last deep recession in the '80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Median household income is actually less than it was eight years  ago.  Those kinds of things, people notice.  You know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  A lot of people will say they can't tell the difference between  the recession and the recovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  And so people are down, and we need everybody to work together.   George Mitchell is right about that as he's right about very many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, thank you, senator, good to see you.</p><p>MITCHELL:  Thank you, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it very much, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Two  tech heavyweights surging in the pre-market after posting strong quarterly  results.</p><p>Jo Ling Kent with all the numbers and the details.  Jo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  It's a good day if you own Facebook or  Alibaba, what a morning for both of those companies.</p><p>Alibaba reporting blockbuster earnings, showing that for now their  consumers continue to consume a lot in China.</p><p>They posted revenue of $5.33 billion, beating expectations for $5.03  billion.  EPS also a beat at 99 cents versus 87 cents.</p><p>Alibaba says it now has 407 million annual active buyers, that's more than  the population of the United States, and mobile revenue is up 192 percent  year-over-year to $101 billion.</p><p>Global merchandize volume also up 23 percent year-over-year to 149 billion.   And Alibaba surging on this news in the pre-market, up about 4 percent  right now in the pre-market.</p><p>Another big story this morning.  Facebook trading up 12 percent ahead of  the bell after earnings beat on revenue and everywhere actually.</p><p>Facebook says it earned $3.73 a share for everyone of its 1.59 billion  monthly active users.</p><p>And I thought this -- that was really interesting.  A 100 million hours of  video are watched on Facebook every single day.</p><p>And Mark Zuckerberg planning to spend big on Instagram, later being for  internet access and other big ventures.</p><p>So, we can see the spending rate continue to go up for Facebook, but  they've been able to match it with revenue and its mobile ad revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Its mobile ad revenue, and you know, interestingly, earlier, we  were talking about this, and someone said, look, it's not just about  mobile.</p><p>Advertisers say, I want to be reaching clients, and the bottom-line is -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Target -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's where the target declines are.</p><p>LING KENT:  It really is one of the only places on social media where you  can reach a very large audiences, very targeted and actually get something  out of it.</p><p>And the metric that Sheryl Sandberg(ph) mentioned on the call last night,  she basically said they can do it with politics and small businesses and  big brands.</p><p>No one else is able to do that right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Dagen McDowell back on set.

They've got is really monetize --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That, Whatsapp, also, the Atlas Rift headset, that virtual  reality headset is coming out which I'm pretty stoked about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, me too -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was just going to say, you know, and this is an  election-year, too.</p><p>So, you know ad spending from that side is going to shoot way up and  Facebook obviously is the key component. </p><p>LING KENT:  They talked about that -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Last night actually, and Sheryl Sanberg(ph) said it's going  very well, politically.</p><p>But what they see is not just the presidential candidates revenue coming  in, it's local politicians that are really using -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  To their -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Advantage -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because of the targeted nature -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sorry, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to comment on the Alibaba.  To me, that's the  other encouraging story so far this morning.</p><p>Because we all know that China has been in this transition from the -- you  know, the investment-driven economy to the consumption-driven economy.</p><p>It seems like at least the consumer is actually holding up in China when  the investment piece we know certainly not.</p><p>LING KENT:  Yes, it seems like the psychology hasn't really affected  consumption, and especially when people on Alibaba are spending very small  amounts, and then some people spend more.</p><p>But they continue to get people on-boarding on mobile first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it might be an indication that the shift from the  capital intensive, you know, infrastructure to the consumer-led.</p><p>This is actually starting to work pretty well.  And these are the type of  companies that you want to be invested in, in China.</p><p>LING KENT:  We'll see.  I'm always skeptical of Alibaba and the structure  of the company and the regulations and kind of fit issues.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  And that, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's a number of people were when they first went public.   Jo, thanks.</p><p>LING KENT:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee will join  me next to discuss his game plan for tonight's GOP debate.</p><p>Before we take a break, take a look at this.

The number is  just out a moment ago.  This is not as bad as some were expecting, still  looking at a decline down 5.1 percent on durable goods orders, however, not  as bad as the expectations called for.  It -- it -- Anastasia, how do you  see this number? </p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  It certainly -- the durable  goods order continues to be a disappointing number.  I mean, all of this is  a function of three forces that are playing in the markets right now, which  is low oil, high dollar. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I got to -- I got to correct myself.  It's down 5.1  percent.  I thought it was five tenth.  Down 5.1 percent is much worse than  expected, 5.1 percent. </p><p>AMOROSO:  That is an incredibly bad number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down 5.1 percent.  Wow.</p><p>ANDY BUSCH, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  What's ex -- what's external lines  (ph), that's .</p><p>AMOROSO:  It -- it certainly -- if that's the number, that's certainly a  huge disappointment.  And again, we have energy deploying for it, we  probably have China to blame for it.  It would be a huge mess. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, 5.1 percent.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.  I think it means the fourth quarter has been --it's going to  be horrendous.  I mean, we already have from the Atlanta GDP now number,  looking at -- at plus point 7.  I think we may take that down a notch or  two for -- for what GDP will be in this.  Place in that team (ph) but  things are bad, things are slowing down, earnings aren't there, so this is  all part of that.  I don't want to read too much in a volatile number, but  we know that, you know, these are things that factor into how you look at  whether you should be invested, how much you should be invested or not.   It's just slowing earnings, slowing GDP. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I believe for a while, durable goods were down for 11 straight  months.  I don't think we've seen an increase.  I think we're continuing on  this trend of down sharply, for .</p><p>AMOROSO:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  . now almost a year. </p><p>AMOROSO:  We absolutely are, and you also see that in the PMI manufacturing  surveys.  For example, whether you look at the new orders component,  whether you .</p><p>BUSCH: Right.</p><p>AMOROSO: . look at the employment component, all of them have been  declining. But this miss is a huge miss.  And this really, I guess shows  how much belt tightening that companies have been .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>. doing in the fourth quarter to navigate this very challenging  environment.  </p><p>BUSCH:  Well, it's interesting because jobless claims are 278, because  that's the ying and the yang here, right.  So, we got obviously -- on the  one side, manufacturing, durable goods that looks really soft.  And on the  other side, employment is holding up really well and jobless claims I think  is -- is a really good, real time number field for how the employment  situation is in the United States, instead of the monthly non-comparable  (ph) numbers.</p><p>So, I'd like to look at that one, especially the four-week average, and  it's holding up really well.  I think that's why most economist are saying,  it's hard to see like a dramatic drop off in the U.S. economy or a  recession in 2016 with those types of numbers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO:  This is -- this is exactly why the fed had to do what they did  yesterday.  They have to stop and reassess the balance of risk.  Because  clearly, as we see today, as we've seen too Maria your point for the last  year, risks are building for the manufacturing sector.  Will they spill  over into the service sector?  So there's two key things that we will be  watching in the service sector.  First is the service employment.  We will  get that in the PMI surveys once again, even before we get into the job  numbers.  The second thing is consumer credit.  That's why the question was  asked here earlier in the show, is, once you seek consumer credit rolling  over that could be a pretty strong indicator.  We're not seeing that yet in  the four-week ... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah, because of.</p><p>AMOROSO:  . average basis.</p><p>BUSCH:  . the jobs are holding up, right? </p><p>AMOROSO:  For now, yeah, for now, but .</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe that though?  I mean, that's the thing, I mean,  the jobs are holding up.  You -- you see more job improvement, but, you  know, when you look at things like durable goods down 5.1 percent, much  worse than expected.  You look at what's happening in the commodities  complex.</p><p>AMOROSO:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- the collapse that we've seen.  That's showing you a  completely different economy than the job improvements. </p><p>AMOROSO:  It is.  You know, for now, it's all about the service jobs,  because that's the biggest chunk of the economy.  But I will say Maria that  as the stock market is down 6 or 7 percent, and as investors have not  really seen stellar returns for even the prior year.  As investors look at  their household net worth, it's not necessarily declining, because housing  prices are still going up.  But it certainly not increasing at the pace  that it was increasing at before.  So, that could potentially dent the  confidence and perhaps further slowdown the momentum that we've already  seen .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO:  . slowdown in the fourth. </p><p>BUSCH:  Well, and a lot of consumers too, and this could be happening as  well. They've never experienced like having money and a job in -- in its  (ph) normal recession.  They've only experienced the great recession,  right.  And so they think that when the economy slows, holy cow, the world  is going to fall apart.  It's not necessarily going to happen, but it will  feel like because that's your only frame of reference.  So, I think it's a  great point to watch consumer spending for sure, of course, but let's see  if that psychology continues to play through. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point that there are stages set, of course,  for the Fox News Republican presidential debate, meanwhile.  Candidates are  hoping to make a lasting impression on Iowa voters before they cast their  votes on Monday.  Joining us right now is Republican presidential  candidate, Mike Huckabee, Governor, good to see you. Thank you so much for  joining us. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you, Maria, great to be here.   It's cold out here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it's cold in Iowa, we know.  We're just getting the  numbers for durable goods order and its cold there as well, by the way.   Because you got an economy that continues to shows signs of deteriorating.   Are you hearing these concerns from Iowa voters right now, governor? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely, Maria.  You know, when I heard the president in his  state of the union trying to talk about how great the economy is doing,  he's just missing it.  He needs to get out more.  And if he would come here  in Iowa, he would talk to single moms like the one I spoke to the other  night in Indianola.  They'll talk about how difficult it is for her, how  she's trying to go to work, but if she does, she loses all the benefits,  her kids basically ends up in dire poverty.  Are the man who makes $59  thousand a year in Davenport, Iowa. He told me that on $59 thousand a year,  he and his wife, that's all on their insurance.  Obamacare this year it's  going to cost them $28 thousand, that's half their income.  These are the  stories of real Americans</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I Agree.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  These are the people that have lost their jobs. </p><p>BUSCH:  And governor, Andy Busch here, I think what's interesting on the  Republican side, and your certainly part of this, I haven't seen this in a  very, very long time.  Where the Republican candidate have put out detailed  tax plan, and I think yours it's very interesting, because it's a national  sales tax.  But you eliminate the income tax and you also have full  expensing but contained -- walk us through why that is important for Iowa. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it's important for all of America.  Because right now we  tax capital and labor, so everything we make in America has 22 percent  embedded tax in it.  But they're not taxing capital and labor in competing  countries like Mexico, China, Indonesia.  As a result of that, we're  getting hammered.  People are losing manufacturing job, 5 million since the  year 2000.  Trillions of dollars of money is parked offshore.  That would  be in our economy but it isn't, because people are protecting it from the  income tax.  So if we stop punishing, which means taxing the productivity  of workers, if we stop taxing the investment of investors, then we have  work and investment coming back.  We're losing both.  And that's why the  fair tax is a superior alternative to taxing people productivity, their  income, their investment. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think you will be able to get tax reform through  when we have been talking about this for so many years, and it's so  impossible to get done? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You have to have leadership to do it.  It's never going to get  done without a president who can explain it, who can articulate it, and who  can make Americans understand how this helps them.  And that's one of the  reasons that I am in this race.  Because I don't think most of the tax  plans -- I hear some of these guys and all they're doing is tap in the  hammer, twisting the screwdriver.  It's tinkering with the tax code.  But  the power of the tax code is the power to shake down the donors, so that  they can get contributions to the political campaigns.  They get tax breaks  to the people who give them donors.  And look, the people who are taking  the gut punches are the folks out here in Middle America, who don't make  millions of dollars a year.  They're hoping to hold on to a $45-$50  thousand a year income, if that.  They're the ones are whom tax reform  makes a world of difference and puts them back in the game of being in the  middle class. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you prepare for tonight, governor?  How do you think  tonight will be different given the fact that Donald Trump will not be on  the stage, and what are you doing to sort of breakout? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, you know, I got to just answer the questions honestly.  I  hope we have sensitive questions we have in the last few debates, and I  think that's been very helpful.  Quite frankly, I'm not  just now kissing  up to you guys, but the Fox Business debates, the two most substance debate  that we have had in the entire cycle, and I say that sincerely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much, sir.  We appreciate that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because the questions are about issues.  They're truly were.   They're really genuinely worth.  And that's what we need tonight.  We need  questions that focus on the people of America, and what we would do as  president to help their lives get back on track so that we can hand this  country to our kids and grandkids in better shape that we are finding it  right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think it's going to be a real, sort of, different, a  stark difference with Donald Trump not on stage?</p><p>HUCABEE:  You know, I don't know, I want to be on stage with him.  I think,  way too many people are talking about Donald Trump, and they're not talking  about these Americans out there, you know, who lost their jobs at the  Newton, Iowa, Maytag plant when it shut down.  And you know, it's not about  Donald Trump.  It's not about me.  It's not about any of the other  candidates.  It really oath to be about how Americans are getting hammered  out there every single day, and you watch people and you look at the --  just their faces and you see their sense of frustration, you see their  anger.  It's like they know that the people who are showing out the big  bucks to the politician, they're fine, they're going to be great.  They're  not going to have to miss a vacation.  They'll jet away to the Caribbean  when it's cold.  And they'll summer in the Hamptons and go to Maine.  But  these folks aren't even able to, you know, 50 miles from home and have a  vacation.  And they just want to know that somebody is going to be out  there fighting for them.  That's why I hope the debate can be about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I would love to run a little bit of your ad, governor.  The  Adele song, do we have that? Here it comes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, governor, what were you thinking with this? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it was my inner Adele.  I think sometimes we have to Back  up and have some fun with this stuff.  And one of the things we wanted to  do is to show that as we travel out there around Iowa, on the frozen  tundra, of snow covered cornfields, you know, there are people in all these  cities, and we try to bring a little culture of Iowa, do it in a fun way.   Interesting is the reaction has gone to some people said, that's the  funniest thing we've seen this cycle, others say that's the dumbest, most  cringed worthy, corniest, nonsense we ever seen in our lives.  So, the good  news is, everybody is talking about it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We like her beautiful voice. Governor, good to see you, thanks  so much you're a sport for explaining it, thanks very much.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You bet. </p><p>BARTIRMO:  We'll see you soon.  Good luck in Iowa, Mike Huckabee, joining  us right there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a short break.  And we got more coverage of what is much  worse than expected durable goods report, down 5.1 percent.  More Mornings  With Maria, straight ahead.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel court report, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Jessica  Vilchis.  At 34, Serena Williams is already the oldest woman to win a  major.  But at this stage of her career, the world's number one is all  about the history books and for tennis legacy. Williams blasted Agnieszka  Radwanska off the court in their semifinal in Melbourne, giving Serena a  shot at winning her 22nd major title, and to tie Steffi Graf in the all- time list.  The American fired 8 aces and 42 winners in comprehensive  straight set win.  She'll Play Angelique Kerber for the title after the  German took care of business against Great Britain, Johanna Konta.  Kerber  has Beaten Williams just once in six previous meetings, with that victory  coming back in 2012.  And don't forget Tennis Channel live coverage from  Melbourne, continues Thursday at 10 PM Eastern. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIRMO:  With that massive weekend snowstorm hitting drivers in the  nation's capital where it hurts, their wallets.

Some  saying it looks more like the hand of God holding a fireball than clouds. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Good morning, I'm Nicole  Petallides, live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  U.S. stock  futures are looking to the upside, about 47 point on the Dow Jones  Industrial average right now, S&amp;P futures up about 8.  We're looking for  some movers today, you have Deutsche Bank pulling back.  Semis could lead  the way, names like United Micro, Terradigm, Texas Instrument.  Alibaba and  Facebook, two names we know so well.  Alibaba came out with sales  expectations that wowed Wall Street, in fact, profit more than double, and  also, saying their well position for China's Shift to consumption and  services going forward.  That stock is likely to be a big winner here up  about 6 percent.  Facebook shares also soaring in the pre-market, up more  than 10 percent throughout this morning.  Mobile moves, obviously that has  been the big story there.  And Mark Zuckerberg now moves to the sixth  richest man in the world.  More Mornings With Maria, coming up.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. I am with Anastasia Amoroso, from JP Morgan, and  Andy Busch this morning.  Let's talk about the durable goods report you  guys, much worse than expected, Anastasia, December durable goods missing  expectations by a wide margin, down 5.1 percent. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Yes, Maria.  Frankly, when you first of that number, I couldn't  believe it, because it's such a big miss.  Digging through the numbers we  have to take out the very volatile defense component, and the very volatile  transportation component.  So, for example defense orders were down about  34 percent.  And non-defense aircraft orders were down about 30 percent.   So, that's what driven a lot of those numbers.  But, even when I take  transportation out of the equation, you are still looking at durable goods  being down, 1.2 percent, once again missing expectation.  As Andy and I,  was just talking about, not only that we miss these expectations, we also  saw downward revisions to the November numbers. Look, it's undeniable that  the state of the manufacturing sector in the United States and globally is  in recession. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, and this tells you that businesses are holding back, on  spending, their holding back on putting money into plants and equipment's,  Andy. </p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.  And I think, well, look at durable goods, the disappointing  component of it is the fact that consumer spending is not holding up.  You  would have thought with the lower gas lean, you start be a dust, start to  see a pick up there.  But, I think, also, it underscores, you know, as far  as growth goes, we need to do something fundamentally globally that to  change the picture.  It isn't quantitative easing anymore, it isn't  monetary easing, this really has to get it.  Economic reform in the United  States, it's really tax reform.  One thing I just want to point out, I  mean, I wrote two articles going through Cruz, Rubio, and Trump, plans, but  I just want to point out is that they have full expensing.  What does that  mean?  It means companies can write off plants and equipment's in the year  that they do it.  That would generate huge economic growth in the United  States.  But don't believe me, you can go to a tax foundation and take a  look at it.  But, it is really important and I believe it will happen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's an interesting point.  Because this is exactly  what this report speaks to.  They're not spending money on plants and  equipment.  You're saying, if in fact we were to see tax reform, because up  until now it has been all about the Fed.  We know that, monetary policy.   We need some fiscal policy.  If we were to see tax they can get a break,  tax wise on investing plants and equipment. </p><p>BUSCH:  Well you can write off wages in the year that you have and expense  for business.  But, you can't do that with a plant.  You have to re-shade  it 10, 20, 30 years, it's ridiculous.  It should be in the year that you  make the payment, right?  And that's what I think.  Hold back to the United  States, all of these, you know, these questions about offshoring and plants  overseas, big tech, big pharma, you cut their tax rate, they will bring  this money back.  That's the international component tax reform.  But the  full expensing will really drive it higher, and I am excited about that.   But we need to get going on it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you analyze Cruz's plan, Rubio</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, Cruz, Trump, and Rubio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  I want to hear your thoughts next time on Carson's plan,  because he's really getting really high marks on his tax plan.  Anastasia,  let me ask you this, we're already in recession when you look at the  industrial side of the economy.  Does this mean, that this durable goods  number, does this make you feel like we could go into an out now recession  in '16? </p><p>AMOROSO:  I don't think so.  I think the consumer can slow is the function  of the stock markets.  Then I'll tell you what I'm most worried about, real  quick, it's China.  You know, China is fighting a wild battle, whether it  comes to the stock market, to their property market, credit market, the  Yuan, and of course, the economy can't solve them all at once, the answer  is probably not.  So, Andy's point is exactly right, we need a new fiscal  policy that would be a stimulus, because China was a huge global stimulus  before.  It's not anymore. </p><p>BARTIRMO:  Yeah, and that's why you're saying exports down, you're seeing  the manufacturing are down, it does have a lot to do with China. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Yes it does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then what do you think this rally all about?  Up 85 points on  the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this is just happening in the last half  an hour, do you think it's because people are saying, look, Federal Reserve  never going to be able to raise rates in March. </p><p>AMOROSO:  I think that is exactly right.  I think they're delaying the  rating increases.  I think it's Mario Draghi doing more of the OJ, doing  more of that what's about.   How long can it go on, I don't know? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Busch, engaged communications, good to see you.</p><p>BUSCH:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come back soon my friend.</p><p>BUSCH:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anastasia Amoroso, always a pleasure. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Great to see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will see you soon, from JP Morgan.  That will do it for us,  Varney and Co. up next, Stuart, over to you, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Am I crazy? </p><p>TRUMP:  You're not crazy at all, but it is about them, it's about making  America great again.</p><p>That's why I'm doing this.  It's not because I want the position, it's  because I know the potential of this country, how great the country can be.</p><p>Our leader is not doing the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in tonight for the Fox News-Google debate,  beginning at 7:00 p.m. Eastern on the Fox News channel.</p><p>Let's look at markets right here.

Blake Burman is in Des  Moines right now with the preview of what to expect tonight.  Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there, Maria, good morning to you.  Donald  Trump continues to maintain steadfastly that he will not be here at the Fox  News debate tonight, later tonight here in Des Moines.</p><p>This is still an incredibly important debate for so many different reasons.   Not only is it the final debate in the lead up until the Iowa caucuses on  Monday night.</p><p>But also the first debate here in Iowa as well, over the issues for Iowa  voters will be front and center.</p><p>There will be 11 other candidates here guaranteed later tonight.  The 9:00  debate has seven candidates on that stage.</p><p>Cruz and Rubio will be front and center, they'll be flanked by Carson and  Bush, Christie and Kasich, and Rand Paul makes his return to the 9:00  debate stage.</p><p>But this all kicks off at 7:00 with four candidates: Fiorina, Huckabee and  Santorum.  Jim Gilmore also returns to this debate. </p><p>I was speaking with an adviser yesterday of Ted Cruz, and that adviser told  me that his campaign feels that Cruz will be the one receiving the cross- fire now.</p><p>Because if Trump isn't there, they say, you know what? People shoot up in  these debates, Cruz is running second in the polls, they expect their guy  to get a lot of the heat tonight.  </p><p>Still, they told me, Maria, Donald Trump will not going to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  But at the end of the day, it's not really the  Donald who is afraid of Megyn.</p><p>It's not that he's afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush.  It's not that he's  afraid of me.  He's afraid of you.</p><p>He doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about  how his record doesn't match what he's selling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Things still look good for Trump here.  A new \"Wall Street  Journal\" poll out this morning shows he has 32 percent support from Iowa  caucus, though rose at 7 points ahead of Cruz, Rubio comes in at 18 as  well.  </p><p>That poll also shows in the other early states of New Hampshire and South  Carolina that Trump lead big.  Maria, back to to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thanks so much Blake Burman.  And joining us  right now is former Senate Majority leader George Mitchell and former RNC  chairman and former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.</p><p>Good to see you both gentlemen, thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>GEORGE MITCHELL, FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  Thank you, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, let me kick this off with you.  What's your take on  what's going on right now?</p><p>Is Trump not showing up tonight, is that going to be good for him or do you  think he loses in this?</p><p>MITCHELL:  I think it's probably not good for him, the more important  question is, will it derail his efforts in it, I doubt that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it won't be good for him, but it won't derail him either?</p><p>MITCHELL:  No, I don't think it would.  Ted Cruz himself said, I think it  was yesterday that, if Trump wins Iowa and then goes on to win New  Hampshire which proves likely, he'll be unstoppable.</p><p>And on that I think Senator Cruz may be right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, governor, what do you think? </p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR:  Well, obviously, Trump thinks  it's good for him or he wouldn't be doing it.  </p><p>This is -- I don't think this is about his feelings being hurt.  I think he  made the calculation he's got more to lose by being in the debate than not  being in the debate. </p><p>But we'll see.  He's -- if the polling is to be believed, he's got a solid  lead in both of these states. </p><p>I don't think anybody has got it in the bag.  I don't think the idea that  somebody is inevitable if they win both these debates is accurate, but I  guess, he gets a mighty powerful momentum --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  If he wins both of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is a really good point.  But let me ask you about  what he said about you governor, because he was asked about you with George  Stephanopoulos.</p><p>And he said, look, Haley Barbour, he's an old-time politician, he's been up  in my office looking for money many times, Trump says.</p><p>He's an old-time politician who is losing his grip.  Frankly, I haven't  heard the name Haley Barbour ever mentioned in a year and a half, and the  reason that me and Ted Cruz are in the lead is because of that. </p><p>What do you think about this governor? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, he's certainly right that I'm old.  But the fact is, George  Stephanopoulos, the next day apologized for telling Donald Trump that I had  said something about him that I didn't say. </p><p>In fact, I hadn't said anything about him.  I've only met the guy twice in  my life and one time he took me to a heavyweight championship fight in  Atlantic City when I was RNC chairman back in the -- back in the '90s. </p><p>I've stayed out of this just like I did in 2008 and 2012 as a former  national party chairman. </p><p>That's what I have intended to do and I've done it again.  I'm going to  support the nominee of the party, because I don't think our country can  stay four more years with Obama's policies.</p><p>And that's what we'll get if we elect Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.   But that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>I'm going to follow Reagan's 11th commandment, I was a political director  to (INAUDIBLE) and Ronald Reagan, that's what he preached and practiced.</p><p>And that's what I start to practice -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  Stephanopoulos apologized because basically  he was starting this thing between the two of you, and you didn't even say  anything. </p><p>It was actually -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  That is right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Henry Barbour, the former -- your nephew and -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  That's exactly right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A Republican strategist, so he said it, he brings up your name  as if you said it, and Trump lashes at you for no reason. </p><p>But Senator Mitchell -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  OK -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea that Bernie Sanders is in the lead in Iowa on the Dem  side and Trump is in the lead on the Republican side. </p><p>What does it say about our country right now? </p><p>MITCHELL:  Well, I think there's a lot of frustration, anger, that happens  whenever the economy turns down.</p><p>The President who campaigns provide an outlet for frustration that people  feel.  Particularly those who aren't moving up in the new economy. </p><p>We figured out a way to encourage innovation, we have the technological  revolutions which we're now passing.</p><p>We'll be seeing in the future as important in human affairs as it was the  industrial revolution.</p><p>But we haven't figured out how to replace the jobs that had been lost.   What I call the working man middle income jobs. </p><p>Factory worker who could support a wife and two children.  And that  frustration will continue for a long time and it's finding its expression  now in the presidential campaign on both sides. </p><p>But I think you're going to see a closely contested election in the general  election.  The country is pretty much divided. </p><p>The parties, well, I think generally unite, you heard Hillary say he'll  support whoever the nominee is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>MITCHELL:  And an interesting way, Trump is the nominee will help the  Democrats unite and Secretary Clinton as the Democratic nominee will help  the Republicans unite.</p><p>So, although, history isn't much of a guide in this election, history tells  us that you can have a hotly contested nominee processes and still find the  parties coming together. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised Bernie Sanders is beating Hillary in Iowa? </p><p>MITCHELL:  No, I think that he's beating Hillary in the polls, and as you  see from the poll results, it's overwhelmingly among young people.</p><p>The question still is whether they will turn out to vote.  But I think once  you get past New Hampshire, he isn't in his favorable territory as he is in  these first two states. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, what about you? You know, you've been the chairman of  the RNC, what do you think in terms of how this plays out next several  months? </p><p>How important is Iowa followed by New Hampshire? What are the other states  that you think will really give us a sense of who in fact people are voting  for? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, when you go down to the south, you'll see if you get  different results, but I'm not sure that you will. </p><p>But I think George Mitchell makes very important points.  The country is  very evenly divided.</p><p>But there's so much polarity.  There's so much division and it is because  as he said, people in our country are dissatisfied.</p><p>And it's not the right or the left, it's both.  You see it in both parties,  and it's because nearly two-thirds of Americans think that the country is  going in the wrong direction.</p><p>And that you thought that for two or three years.  This is not some  phenomenon because something bad happened last week or last month or last  quarter. </p><p>People have been very dissatisfied about the economy, about national  security, about so many things that it's manifesting now that people say,  you know, that they're mad at everybody in Washington.</p><p>Hence Bernie Sanders, hence Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, both parties though.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, who do you think has the best plan to fix some of these  things then? I mean, you know, Senator Mitchell is talking about  automation, technology displacing people.</p><p>Obviously wages haven't moved.  There are a lot of issues that are  upsetting people.</p><p>BARBOUR:  And very rarely is that talked about in the news coverage.   Mostly, it's about personality, it's about polling, it's about tactics.</p><p>We need more of the debate to be about.  Here is the problem, here is my  plan to fix the problem, and frankly, the candidates that talked the most  about that, Kasich and Bush and Christie on our side, they get the least  coverage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Donald Trump gets ten times more coverage than everybody else  combined without ever really talking about anything and any detail.</p><p>And I'm not criticizing, that's just the fact. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Public use very little about the issues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but to be fair, I mean, in our debates that we've done  here at the Fox Business Network, we stuck to the issues, we got a chance  to really talk about tax reform.</p><p>Did you hear anything that you feel would resonate with people, senator?</p><p>MITCHELL:  Well, it's very difficult in the current campaign mode,  particularly these debates.  </p><p>No criticism of anybody when you got a dozen people up on the stage and you  got 30 or 60 seconds to answer a question.</p><p>It's conducive to bumper stickers, slogans and superficial statements -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  If you get up and make a reasonable statement, you'll never get  on the television news or get in the newspapers.</p><p>Could I just add one point then, not to disagree with Haley, the feeling of  dissatisfaction goes back a lot longer than two or three years.</p><p>You'll recall in 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had a very difficult economic  circumstance.  </p><p>We were losing 400,000 jobs a month at the -- at the bottom of the  recession in which we dropped and there was enormous dissatisfaction then.</p><p>Since then, it's come back some in the President's term, 15 million new  jobs have been created.  </p><p>We have the strongest economy in the world by far, how it's relative and  turning to -- and Russia have far more serious problems than we do.</p><p>But we still have serious issues that we have not been able to overcome,  that will take a unified effort.</p><p>And one of the long term disadvantages of these polarizing campaigns is  that it's hard to get people working together again after the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  When we really need to pull together to try to solve some of the  long range issues that are not attributable to one party or the other, to  one president or another. </p><p>But really are attributable to underlying economic, social and cultural  forces that are affecting not just the people of this country, but people  all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess governor, as you said, people are frustrated that  we're not farther along. </p><p>I mean, you're right, the financial crisis in 2008 is where this feelings  started.</p><p>But they're looking in the last 7 years and saying, my wages haven't moved,  my situation hasn't changed much.</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, the recovery has been the weakest since World War II about  2.2 percent a year economic growth which is about half as much growth per  year as after the last deep recession in the '80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  Median household income is actually less than it was eight years  ago.  Those kinds of things, people notice.  You know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  A lot of people will say they can't tell the difference between  the recession and the recovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>BARBOUR:  And so people are down, and we need everybody to work together.   George Mitchell is right about that as he's right about very many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, thank you, senator, good to see you.</p><p>MITCHELL:  Thank you, Maria -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it very much, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Back in a minute with more Facebook. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's all about technology on the upside.  Two  tech heavyweights surging in the pre-market after posting strong quarterly  results.</p><p>Jo Ling Kent with all the numbers and the details.  Jo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  It's a good day if you own Facebook or  Alibaba, what a morning for both of those companies.</p><p>Alibaba reporting blockbuster earnings, showing that for now their  consumers continue to consume a lot in China.</p><p>They posted revenue of $5.33 billion, beating expectations for $5.03  billion.  EPS also a beat at 99 cents versus 87 cents.</p><p>Alibaba says it now has 407 million annual active buyers, that's more than  the population of the United States, and mobile revenue is up 192 percent  year-over-year to $101 billion.</p><p>Global merchandize volume also up 23 percent year-over-year to 149 billion.   And Alibaba surging on this news in the pre-market, up about 4 percent  right now in the pre-market.</p><p>Another big story this morning.  Facebook trading up 12 percent ahead of  the bell after earnings beat on revenue and everywhere actually.</p><p>Facebook says it earned $3.73 a share for everyone of its 1.59 billion  monthly active users.</p><p>And I thought this -- that was really interesting.  A 100 million hours of  video are watched on Facebook every single day.</p><p>And Mark Zuckerberg planning to spend big on Instagram, later being for  internet access and other big ventures.</p><p>So, we can see the spending rate continue to go up for Facebook, but  they've been able to match it with revenue and its mobile ad revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Its mobile ad revenue, and you know, interestingly, earlier, we  were talking about this, and someone said, look, it's not just about  mobile.</p><p>Advertisers say, I want to be reaching clients, and the bottom-line is -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Target -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's where the target declines are.</p><p>LING KENT:  It really is one of the only places on social media where you  can reach a very large audiences, very targeted and actually get something  out of it.</p><p>And the metric that Sheryl Sandberg(ph) mentioned on the call last night,  she basically said they can do it with politics and small businesses and  big brands.</p><p>No one else is able to do that right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Dagen McDowell back on set.  Some pretty big wins for  these companies.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  And this is -- this is really good news for  the markets that you can have a company that really delivers, that looks  good.</p><p>Anastasia was pointing to the fact that it has a very large concentration  of business in the United States, which is positive.</p><p>And have a stock that it raises about a 10 percent loss so far this year,  potentially in one day.</p><p>They've got a lot of upside video here, only about 20 percent so far.   They've got is really monetize --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That, Whatsapp, also, the Atlas Rift headset, that virtual  reality headset is coming out which I'm pretty stoked about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, me too -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was just going to say, you know, and this is an  election-year, too.</p><p>So, you know ad spending from that side is going to shoot way up and  Facebook obviously is the key component. </p><p>LING KENT:  They talked about that -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Last night actually, and Sheryl Sanberg(ph) said it's going  very well, politically.</p><p>But what they see is not just the presidential candidates revenue coming  in, it's local politicians that are really using -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  To their -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes -- </p><p>LING KENT:  Advantage -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because of the targeted nature -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sorry, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want to comment on the Alibaba.  To me, that's the  other encouraging story so far this morning.</p><p>Because we all know that China has been in this transition from the -- you  know, the investment-driven economy to the consumption-driven economy.</p><p>It seems like at least the consumer is actually holding up in China when  the investment piece we know certainly not.</p><p>LING KENT:  Yes, it seems like the psychology hasn't really affected  consumption, and especially when people on Alibaba are spending very small  amounts, and then some people spend more.</p><p>But they continue to get people on-boarding on mobile first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, it might be an indication that the shift from the  capital intensive, you know, infrastructure to the consumer-led.</p><p>This is actually starting to work pretty well.  And these are the type of  companies that you want to be invested in, in China.</p><p>LING KENT:  We'll see.  I'm always skeptical of Alibaba and the structure  of the company and the regulations and kind of fit issues.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right -- </p><p>LING KENT:  And that, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's a number of people were when they first went public.   Jo, thanks.</p><p>LING KENT:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee will join  me next to discuss his game plan for tonight's GOP debate.</p><p>Before we take a break, take a look at this.

The number is  just out a moment ago.  This is not as bad as some were expecting, still  looking at a decline down 5.1 percent on durable goods orders, however, not  as bad as the expectations called for.  It -- it -- Anastasia, how do you  see this number? </p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  It certainly -- the durable  goods order continues to be a disappointing number.  I mean, all of this is  a function of three forces that are playing in the markets right now, which  is low oil, high dollar. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I got to -- I got to correct myself.  It's down 5.1  percent.  I thought it was five tenth.  Down 5.1 percent is much worse than  expected, 5.1 percent. </p><p>AMOROSO:  That is an incredibly bad number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down 5.1 percent.  Wow.</p><p>ANDY BUSCH, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  What's ex -- what's external lines  (ph), that's .</p><p>AMOROSO:  It -- it certainly -- if that's the number, that's certainly a  huge disappointment.  And again, we have energy deploying for it, we  probably have China to blame for it.  It would be a huge mess. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, 5.1 percent.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.  I think it means the fourth quarter has been --it's going to  be horrendous.  I mean, we already have from the Atlanta GDP now number,  looking at -- at plus point 7.  I think we may take that down a notch or  two for -- for what GDP will be in this.  Place in that team (ph) but  things are bad, things are slowing down, earnings aren't there, so this is  all part of that.  I don't want to read too much in a volatile number, but  we know that, you know, these are things that factor into how you look at  whether you should be invested, how much you should be invested or not.   It's just slowing earnings, slowing GDP. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I believe for a while, durable goods were down for 11 straight  months.  I don't think we've seen an increase.  I think we're continuing on  this trend of down sharply, for .</p><p>AMOROSO:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  . now almost a year. </p><p>AMOROSO:  We absolutely are, and you also see that in the PMI manufacturing  surveys.  For example, whether you look at the new orders component,  whether you .</p><p>BUSCH: Right.</p><p>AMOROSO: . look at the employment component, all of them have been  declining. But this miss is a huge miss.  And this really, I guess shows  how much belt tightening that companies have been .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>. doing in the fourth quarter to navigate this very challenging  environment.  </p><p>BUSCH:  Well, it's interesting because jobless claims are 278, because  that's the ying and the yang here, right.  So, we got obviously -- on the  one side, manufacturing, durable goods that looks really soft.  And on the  other side, employment is holding up really well and jobless claims I think  is -- is a really good, real time number field for how the employment  situation is in the United States, instead of the monthly non-comparable  (ph) numbers.</p><p>So, I'd like to look at that one, especially the four-week average, and  it's holding up really well.  I think that's why most economist are saying,  it's hard to see like a dramatic drop off in the U.S. economy or a  recession in 2016 with those types of numbers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO:  This is -- this is exactly why the fed had to do what they did  yesterday.  They have to stop and reassess the balance of risk.  Because  clearly, as we see today, as we've seen too Maria your point for the last  year, risks are building for the manufacturing sector.  Will they spill  over into the service sector?  So there's two key things that we will be  watching in the service sector.  First is the service employment.  We will  get that in the PMI surveys once again, even before we get into the job  numbers.  The second thing is consumer credit.  That's why the question was  asked here earlier in the show, is, once you seek consumer credit rolling  over that could be a pretty strong indicator.  We're not seeing that yet in  the four-week ... </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah, because of.</p><p>AMOROSO:  . average basis.</p><p>BUSCH:  . the jobs are holding up, right? </p><p>AMOROSO:  For now, yeah, for now, but .</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you believe that though?  I mean, that's the thing, I mean,  the jobs are holding up.  You -- you see more job improvement, but, you  know, when you look at things like durable goods down 5.1 percent, much  worse than expected.  You look at what's happening in the commodities  complex.</p><p>AMOROSO:  Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- the collapse that we've seen.  That's showing you a  completely different economy than the job improvements. </p><p>AMOROSO:  It is.  You know, for now, it's all about the service jobs,  because that's the biggest chunk of the economy.  But I will say Maria that  as the stock market is down 6 or 7 percent, and as investors have not  really seen stellar returns for even the prior year.  As investors look at  their household net worth, it's not necessarily declining, because housing  prices are still going up.  But it certainly not increasing at the pace  that it was increasing at before.  So, that could potentially dent the  confidence and perhaps further slowdown the momentum that we've already  seen .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO:  . slowdown in the fourth. </p><p>BUSCH:  Well, and a lot of consumers too, and this could be happening as  well. They've never experienced like having money and a job in -- in its  (ph) normal recession.  They've only experienced the great recession,  right.  And so they think that when the economy slows, holy cow, the world  is going to fall apart.  It's not necessarily going to happen, but it will  feel like because that's your only frame of reference.  So, I think it's a  great point to watch consumer spending for sure, of course, but let's see  if that psychology continues to play through. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point that there are stages set, of course,  for the Fox News Republican presidential debate, meanwhile.  Candidates are  hoping to make a lasting impression on Iowa voters before they cast their  votes on Monday.  Joining us right now is Republican presidential  candidate, Mike Huckabee, Governor, good to see you. Thank you so much for  joining us. </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Thank you, Maria, great to be here.   It's cold out here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yeah, it's cold in Iowa, we know.  We're just getting the  numbers for durable goods order and its cold there as well, by the way.   Because you got an economy that continues to shows signs of deteriorating.   Are you hearing these concerns from Iowa voters right now, governor? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Absolutely, Maria.  You know, when I heard the president in his  state of the union trying to talk about how great the economy is doing,  he's just missing it.  He needs to get out more.  And if he would come here  in Iowa, he would talk to single moms like the one I spoke to the other  night in Indianola.  They'll talk about how difficult it is for her, how  she's trying to go to work, but if she does, she loses all the benefits,  her kids basically ends up in dire poverty.  Are the man who makes $59  thousand a year in Davenport, Iowa. He told me that on $59 thousand a year,  he and his wife, that's all on their insurance.  Obamacare this year it's  going to cost them $28 thousand, that's half their income.  These are the  stories of real Americans</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I Agree.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  These are the people that have lost their jobs. </p><p>BUSCH:  And governor, Andy Busch here, I think what's interesting on the  Republican side, and your certainly part of this, I haven't seen this in a  very, very long time.  Where the Republican candidate have put out detailed  tax plan, and I think yours it's very interesting, because it's a national  sales tax.  But you eliminate the income tax and you also have full  expensing but contained -- walk us through why that is important for Iowa. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it's important for all of America.  Because right now we  tax capital and labor, so everything we make in America has 22 percent  embedded tax in it.  But they're not taxing capital and labor in competing  countries like Mexico, China, Indonesia.  As a result of that, we're  getting hammered.  People are losing manufacturing job, 5 million since the  year 2000.  Trillions of dollars of money is parked offshore.  That would  be in our economy but it isn't, because people are protecting it from the  income tax.  So if we stop punishing, which means taxing the productivity  of workers, if we stop taxing the investment of investors, then we have  work and investment coming back.  We're losing both.  And that's why the  fair tax is a superior alternative to taxing people productivity, their  income, their investment. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think you will be able to get tax reform through  when we have been talking about this for so many years, and it's so  impossible to get done? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You have to have leadership to do it.  It's never going to get  done without a president who can explain it, who can articulate it, and who  can make Americans understand how this helps them.  And that's one of the  reasons that I am in this race.  Because I don't think most of the tax  plans -- I hear some of these guys and all they're doing is tap in the  hammer, twisting the screwdriver.  It's tinkering with the tax code.  But  the power of the tax code is the power to shake down the donors, so that  they can get contributions to the political campaigns.  They get tax breaks  to the people who give them donors.  And look, the people who are taking  the gut punches are the folks out here in Middle America, who don't make  millions of dollars a year.  They're hoping to hold on to a $45-$50  thousand a year income, if that.  They're the ones are whom tax reform  makes a world of difference and puts them back in the game of being in the  middle class. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you prepare for tonight, governor?  How do you think  tonight will be different given the fact that Donald Trump will not be on  the stage, and what are you doing to sort of breakout? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, you know, I got to just answer the questions honestly.  I  hope we have sensitive questions we have in the last few debates, and I  think that's been very helpful.  Quite frankly, I'm not  just now kissing  up to you guys, but the Fox Business debates, the two most substance debate  that we have had in the entire cycle, and I say that sincerely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much, sir.  We appreciate that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because the questions are about issues.  They're truly were.   They're really genuinely worth.  And that's what we need tonight.  We need  questions that focus on the people of America, and what we would do as  president to help their lives get back on track so that we can hand this  country to our kids and grandkids in better shape that we are finding it  right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think it's going to be a real, sort of, different, a  stark difference with Donald Trump not on stage?</p><p>HUCABEE:  You know, I don't know, I want to be on stage with him.  I think,  way too many people are talking about Donald Trump, and they're not talking  about these Americans out there, you know, who lost their jobs at the  Newton, Iowa, Maytag plant when it shut down.  And you know, it's not about  Donald Trump.  It's not about me.  It's not about any of the other  candidates.  It really oath to be about how Americans are getting hammered  out there every single day, and you watch people and you look at the --  just their faces and you see their sense of frustration, you see their  anger.  It's like they know that the people who are showing out the big  bucks to the politician, they're fine, they're going to be great.  They're  not going to have to miss a vacation.  They'll jet away to the Caribbean  when it's cold.  And they'll summer in the Hamptons and go to Maine.  But  these folks aren't even able to, you know, 50 miles from home and have a  vacation.  And they just want to know that somebody is going to be out  there fighting for them.  That's why I hope the debate can be about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I would love to run a little bit of your ad, governor.  The  Adele song, do we have that? Here it comes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, governor, what were you thinking with this? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it was my inner Adele.  I think sometimes we have to Back  up and have some fun with this stuff.  And one of the things we wanted to  do is to show that as we travel out there around Iowa, on the frozen  tundra, of snow covered cornfields, you know, there are people in all these  cities, and we try to bring a little culture of Iowa, do it in a fun way.   Interesting is the reaction has gone to some people said, that's the  funniest thing we've seen this cycle, others say that's the dumbest, most  cringed worthy, corniest, nonsense we ever seen in our lives.  So, the good  news is, everybody is talking about it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We like her beautiful voice. Governor, good to see you, thanks  so much you're a sport for explaining it, thanks very much.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You bet. </p><p>BARTIRMO:  We'll see you soon.  Good luck in Iowa, Mike Huckabee, joining  us right there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a short break.  And we got more coverage of what is much  worse than expected durable goods report, down 5.1 percent.  More Mornings  With Maria, straight ahead.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel court report, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Jessica  Vilchis.  At 34, Serena Williams is already the oldest woman to win a  major.  But at this stage of her career, the world's number one is all  about the history books and for tennis legacy. Williams blasted Agnieszka  Radwanska off the court in their semifinal in Melbourne, giving Serena a  shot at winning her 22nd major title, and to tie Steffi Graf in the all- time list.  The American fired 8 aces and 42 winners in comprehensive  straight set win.  She'll Play Angelique Kerber for the title after the  German took care of business against Great Britain, Johanna Konta.  Kerber  has Beaten Williams just once in six previous meetings, with that victory  coming back in 2012.  And don't forget Tennis Channel live coverage from  Melbourne, continues Thursday at 10 PM Eastern. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIRMO:  With that massive weekend snowstorm hitting drivers in the  nation's capital where it hurts, their wallets.  Cheryl Casone with that  and the other headlines right now, Cheryl </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Oh yeah, Maria.  Washington, D.C.  handing out tickets totaling more than $1 million for violators of its  parking ban since in-acting as snow emergencies last Friday.  The city has  issued more than 5200 snow emergency tickets, each at a cost of $250.  A  woman mammoth remains discovered during construction  at Oregon State  University.  The school said the crews recovered a large bone on Monday,  for the digging revealed more bones from several extinct mammals.  Santa  Claus under arrest, this guy whose legal name really is Santa Claus was  charged driving under the influence, after Idaho police said they saw him  driving on the wrong side of the street.  And finally, Maria, and ladies,  this is amazing.  Barbie is getting a whole new body.  The so-called the  world's bestselling doll is actually getting three new bodies.  They're  going to have petite, tall, and my favorite is going to be curvy.  Pastel  and Mattel still plan to make the original fit of waist of Barbie, but in  the age of Beyonce and Kim Kardashian, great message going out to kids  everywhere, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Trying to be more realistic, I guess.</p><p>CASONE:  Yeah, it should be. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  I like that.  Still to come, amazing  numbers from China E-commerce Alibaba, stocks getting it boast from the  pre-markets, and then there's Facebook.  Plus, an incredible cloud  formation over Portugal, captured in film.  Take a look at this photo. Some  saying it looks more like the hand of God holding a fireball than clouds. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Good morning, I'm Nicole  Petallides, live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  U.S. stock  futures are looking to the upside, about 47 point on the Dow Jones  Industrial average right now, S&amp;P futures up about 8.  We're looking for  some movers today, you have Deutsche Bank pulling back.  Semis could lead  the way, names like United Micro, Terradigm, Texas Instrument.  Alibaba and  Facebook, two names we know so well.  Alibaba came out with sales  expectations that wowed Wall Street, in fact, profit more than double, and  also, saying their well position for China's Shift to consumption and  services going forward.  That stock is likely to be a big winner here up  about 6 percent.  Facebook shares also soaring in the pre-market, up more  than 10 percent throughout this morning.  Mobile moves, obviously that has  been the big story there.  And Mark Zuckerberg now moves to the sixth  richest man in the world.  More Mornings With Maria, coming up.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. I am with Anastasia Amoroso, from JP Morgan, and  Andy Busch this morning.  Let's talk about the durable goods report you  guys, much worse than expected, Anastasia, December durable goods missing  expectations by a wide margin, down 5.1 percent. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Yes, Maria.  Frankly, when you first of that number, I couldn't  believe it, because it's such a big miss.  Digging through the numbers we  have to take out the very volatile defense component, and the very volatile  transportation component.  So, for example defense orders were down about  34 percent.  And non-defense aircraft orders were down about 30 percent.   So, that's what driven a lot of those numbers.  But, even when I take  transportation out of the equation, you are still looking at durable goods  being down, 1.2 percent, once again missing expectation.  As Andy and I,  was just talking about, not only that we miss these expectations, we also  saw downward revisions to the November numbers. Look, it's undeniable that  the state of the manufacturing sector in the United States and globally is  in recession. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, and this tells you that businesses are holding back, on  spending, their holding back on putting money into plants and equipment's,  Andy. </p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah.  And I think, well, look at durable goods, the disappointing  component of it is the fact that consumer spending is not holding up.  You  would have thought with the lower gas lean, you start be a dust, start to  see a pick up there.  But, I think, also, it underscores, you know, as far  as growth goes, we need to do something fundamentally globally that to  change the picture.  It isn't quantitative easing anymore, it isn't  monetary easing, this really has to get it.  Economic reform in the United  States, it's really tax reform.  One thing I just want to point out, I  mean, I wrote two articles going through Cruz, Rubio, and Trump, plans, but  I just want to point out is that they have full expensing.  What does that  mean?  It means companies can write off plants and equipment's in the year  that they do it.  That would generate huge economic growth in the United  States.  But don't believe me, you can go to a tax foundation and take a  look at it.  But, it is really important and I believe it will happen. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's an interesting point.  Because this is exactly  what this report speaks to.  They're not spending money on plants and  equipment.  You're saying, if in fact we were to see tax reform, because up  until now it has been all about the Fed.  We know that, monetary policy.   We need some fiscal policy.  If we were to see tax they can get a break,  tax wise on investing plants and equipment. </p><p>BUSCH:  Well you can write off wages in the year that you have and expense  for business.  But, you can't do that with a plant.  You have to re-shade  it 10, 20, 30 years, it's ridiculous.  It should be in the year that you  make the payment, right?  And that's what I think.  Hold back to the United  States, all of these, you know, these questions about offshoring and plants  overseas, big tech, big pharma, you cut their tax rate, they will bring  this money back.  That's the international component tax reform.  But the  full expensing will really drive it higher, and I am excited about that.   But we need to get going on it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you analyze Cruz's plan, Rubio</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, Cruz, Trump, and Rubio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  I want to hear your thoughts next time on Carson's plan,  because he's really getting really high marks on his tax plan.  Anastasia,  let me ask you this, we're already in recession when you look at the  industrial side of the economy.  Does this mean, that this durable goods  number, does this make you feel like we could go into an out now recession  in '16? </p><p>AMOROSO:  I don't think so.  I think the consumer can slow is the function  of the stock markets.  Then I'll tell you what I'm most worried about, real  quick, it's China.  You know, China is fighting a wild battle, whether it  comes to the stock market, to their property market, credit market, the  Yuan, and of course, the economy can't solve them all at once, the answer  is probably not.  So, Andy's point is exactly right, we need a new fiscal  policy that would be a stimulus, because China was a huge global stimulus  before.  It's not anymore. </p><p>BARTIRMO:  Yeah, and that's why you're saying exports down, you're seeing  the manufacturing are down, it does have a lot to do with China. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Yes it does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then what do you think this rally all about?  Up 85 points on  the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this is just happening in the last half  an hour, do you think it's because people are saying, look, Federal Reserve  never going to be able to raise rates in March. </p><p>AMOROSO:  I think that is exactly right.  I think they're delaying the  rating increases.  I think it's Mario Draghi doing more of the OJ, doing  more of that what's about.   How long can it go on, I don't know? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Busch, engaged communications, good to see you.</p><p>BUSCH:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come back soon my friend.</p><p>BUSCH:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anastasia Amoroso, always a pleasure. </p><p>AMOROSO:  Great to see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will see you soon, from JP Morgan.  That will do it for us,  Varney and Co. up next, Stuart, over to you, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, January 28.</p><p>With me this morning JPMorgan Asset Management's Anastasia Amoroso; Engage  Communications Andy Busch; and former Home Depot and Chrysler CEO Bob  Nardelli.</p><p>First though your top stories at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast this morning:</p><p>Republican candidates gearing up for tonight's debate in Iowa.  The event  hosted by the Fox News Channel our sister network is the final GOP debate  before the Iowa caucus begins on Monday morning.</p><p>Front runner Donald Trump still says he will not participate in tonight's  event.  He went on THE O'REILLY FACTOR last night and explained decision.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST:  I submit to you that you need to change and  get away from the personal -- they hurt my feelings, are unfair to me --  and make it about them, the folks, not about you.  And you elevate then to  a place where you could win this if you do that.  Am I crazy?  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You are not crazy at all --  Bill.  But it's about them.  It's about making America great again.  That's  why I'm doing this.  It's not because I want the position.  It's because I  know the potential of this country, how great the country can be.  Our  leader is not doing the job.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in tonight for the Fox News/Google debate  beginning at 7:00 p.m. Eastern; main debate at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Let's got markets right now: futures cutting earlier gains now in negative  territory -- really a mixed story.  But now we're looking at the Dow  Industrials opening lower.  This after the Federal Reserve yesterday raised  questions about the next time they will raise interest rates.  Basically  the Fed said that the economy slowed down at the end of last year.</p><p>In Europe, markets are lower this morning across the board -- about a half  a percent lower to better than 1 percent.  Actually things have worsened in  the last 20 minutes or so across the board In Europe as well as in the U.S.   This is probably one of the reasons the U.S. turned lower because European  markets are now down better than 1 percent.</p><p>It all started in Asia -- we had a sharp selloff in China.  The Shanghai  composite down nearly 3 percent on the session.  The Nikkei average in  Japan down three-quarters of a percent ahead of that Bank of Japan meeting  this Friday.</p><p>Facebook, the stock to watch today at -- the social media giant  handily beat earnings expectations.  Revenue soared better than 50 percent  in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  It was driven by mobile  advertising.  The stock up in the premarket -- that is pretty much where it  has then.  It has not cut losses on Facebook.</p><p>New cases of the Zika virus confirmed in the United States -- there are now  at least six cases of this virus including in New York.  Delta is now  joining United and American basically allowing passengers to cancel or  postpone trips to the areas that are affected by this outbreak.</p><p>We turn now to the 2016 campaign trail.  Republican presidential candidates  are getting ready to face off for tonight's Fox News debate in Iowa -- the  last GOP 0debate before Monday's Iowa caucuses.</p><p>Blake Berman right now in Des Moines, live for the preview of what to  expect tonight.  Blake -- good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BERMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there -- Maria.  Good morning to you  as well.  Donald Trump continues to maintain that he will not be at the  debate tonight here in Des Moines, Iowa on the Fox News Channel -- ever so  important because not only is this the last debate before Monday night's  caucuses but it's also the first debate here in Iowa as well.</p><p>These candidates have been here for months on end -- some in fact more than  a year and this is their last chance in some cases to make a final push  before Monday night's caucuses.  There still will be seven people on that  stage at 9:00 tonight.  Cruz and Rubio will be front and center flanked  alongside Carson and Bush, Christie and Kasich and Rand Paul returns to the  9:00 debate as well.</p><p>Before then, setting the stage is Fiorina, Huckabee and Santorum at 7:00.   Jim Gilmore joins the stage with them once again.  I was speaking, Maria,  to an adviser, last night, of Ted Cruz and they told me they expect their  guy to be basically surrounded later tonight now that Donald Trump is not,  as he says, going to be in this debate.  They say everybody shoots up and  they feel that their guy is going to be the one taking all the crossfire.</p><p>Still they say Trump is not going to be let off the hook.  They anticipate  Marco Rubio being the one specifically going right at Cruz.  Rubio gave a  bit of a preview last night about how he might treat Trump.  Take a listen  here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I do think voters in Iowa  deserve to know what the next commander-in-chief and president is going to  do.  And that's what these debate serve, as an opportunity to answer that  questions.  Voters deserve to know, if we elect you president, what are you  going to do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  That there a slight dig at Trump.  By the way, Maria, the \"Wall  Street Journal\" released a slew of polls this morning which shows Trump  leads in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- of course, the three  early voting states -- his lead with seven points: 32, Cruz 25 and Rubio at  18.  </p><p>I'll send it back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake -- thanks so much.  Big night tonight --  Blake Berman. </p><p>The stage, of course, set for that last Republican presidential debate  before the first votes of 2016 are cast.</p><p>We want to bring in right now Iowa Senator Joni Ernst.  Senator -- good to  see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>SEN. JONI ERNST (R), IOWA:  Thank you for having me.  Great to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So who do you think will be the standout in Iowa tonight?  </p><p>ERNEST:  Oh my gosh.  Well, we have so many great candidates.  But of  course, not having one of our candidates there gives everybody else a great  opportunity to state what their policy positions are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean I know that you said you are not ready to endorse  anybody but you've had some very nice comments about Marco Rubio recently  in terms of his commitment to destroy ISIS and in terms of him being near  and dear to my heart.  Are you considering perhaps the vice presidential  position with Marco Rubio should he get the nomination?  </p><p>ERNEST:  No, no.  I am not pursuing that.  I do think we have great  candidates all across the board and every one of our candidates -- I want  to make sure I say this -- every one of our candidates has a great position  when it comes to national defense, much better than anyone we have seen on  the other ticket.  So I think we're going to do very well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's Andy Busch.</p><p>ANDREW BUSCH, ENGAGE COMMUNICATIONS:  Yes.  I've got a question for you.   For Iowa, if you look at the economic plans of the top three candidates or  really just overall, what do you want to see for Iowa?  What would really  make you feel great about a candidate with something that they're doing on  an economic plan that's going to help Iowa?  </p><p>ERNST:  Well, I think Iowa has really set the standard.  We do have a very  low unemployment rate there, a lot of job growth and job expansion.  So  what we are looking for is a plan that would allow for less rules and  regulations so that our businesses can further develop in Iowa, allow them  to expand, less government interference, and of course, low taxes is always  a great way to stimulate growth.  That is what we need to look for across  the board in those candidates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here is Bob Nardelli -- Senator.  </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER CEO:  And so, Senator, with  that as a backdrop who is the best candidate to meet those requirements?  </p><p>ERNST:  Well, again, I'm not going to pick winners or losers here.  Still  have a lot of horses in the race.  But I think that again if you look  across the board, all of them have put forward pretty good plans.</p><p>I am not going to state who I think would be best.  I don't want to  dissuade Iowa voters from going out to the caucuses Monday evening.  I want  to make sure they are looking at policies and deciding who is fitting their  needs and their values.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  Who has the best GDP plan to get out of this low and slow  growth?  We always have this aspiration of 3 percent, 3.5 percent and we  end up somewhere well below that -- Senator.  </p><p>ERNST:  Well, I think if you look at those that have served in governmental  roles, whether as a governor or as a senator, they have all dealt with  those types of plans.  And so I would look to those that have experience in  those areas and have worked with government and those that have successful  career tracks.  So I would say start there and we'll see what they come up  with tonight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that's a great point to make because many on the stage  had the experience in the background -- backdrop to really make a  difference.  </p><p>Let me ask you.  You just really painted a picture of a pretty good economy  in Iowa in terms of the unemployment situation, in terms of growth there.   What do you think then is most important to Iowa voters?  What do you hear  from consumers and constituents in the state that they are most worried  about?  </p><p>ERNST:  There are two very big issues that we see always come to the  surface.  The first always is national defense.  Iowa is a great export  state.  So not only do they look at the economy, but they are looking at is  there world stability in those areas that we are doing trade with.</p><p>So they'll look at national defense.  They want to know that they are  protected.</p><p>Second is jobs and economy whether it's internationally or domestically and  how the economy will impact their everyday lives.  Those are the top  issues.  I know those were important in my race in 2014.  Those are still  very important as we move forward to 2016.  And we need a candidate that  has policy behind their words.</p><p>So again I encourage those Iowa voters to take a very close look at what  policies are being presented, and does not reflect the Iowa way of life.    Is that what they are looking for in a candidate?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really an important point because here we are in an  economy that yes, domestically we're seeing some strength and certainly  improvement when you look at the jobs numbers.  But it's the international  story that really keeps capping the ability to grow and the export part of  that story is reflecting that.  Exports are down on a national level.</p><p>ERNST:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you propose in terms of, you know, fighting back on  automation, I mean technology has displaced workers.  What do you propose  in terms of growing in the face of this weakness that we are seeing for  multinationals?</p><p>ERNST:  Well, I think as we look at the international scale and what needs  to be done here in the United States as well as Iowa specifically is take a  look at what our future is going to bring.</p><p>You mentioned technology, it is displacing workers.  We still need those  workers and we need more workers in the technology field.</p><p>So we are working on that in Iowa.  We are expanding technology, directing  our young students into those types of areas.  Iowa is a great cross- section of America.  We have a great agricultural base.  We have great  manufacturing base.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ERNST:  But we're also moving forward in technology and that's where we  need to go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really important point.  Anastasia, you want to jump in here?   Here is Anastasia Amoroso from JPMorgan.  Because this is exactly what the  issues are for the economy.</p><p>ERNST:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Iowa is a great picture to show what is going on in terms of  the multinational and the weakness coming from the global economy.  </p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes, absolutely -- key issue  for voters.  But I guess I want to go back to something you mentioned  earlier is that people who have the experience to fix this are governors or  senators, but those are all the same people that are also defined by the  voters as the establishment and this campaign has been all about the anti- establishment.</p><p>How do you solve that?  How can you bring experience and still appeal to  the voters?  </p><p>ERNST:  Well, I think you can bring experience but you need to look for  those that are really fighting for what we desire to see us as Republicans  as a party and that is job growth.  So who has a great track record?  Maybe  it's in their state, maybe it's in the senate with their ideas and their  policies and understanding we haven't had that majority in the past.</p><p>And so who has been on the forefront of that?  Who has really tried to move  their ideas forward?  So, you know, they may be considered establishment by  some, but again I think we need to look at them individually and take a  look at their policies and what have they really worked on?</p><p>You know, I just want to push back.  I think we've got all great candidates  across the board.  We want to see them be successful.  We want absolutely  the best nominee we can come up with and, of course, our nominees are going  to be far better than what we're seeing from the last.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it going to be very different without Donald Trump on that  stage tonight, Senator?  </p><p>ERNST:  It will be very different.  It will be different.  And every  candidate will make a choice on whether they want to show up or not.  But  this is the last opportunity that our candidates have to talk to the Iowa  people and convince them that their policy is right.</p><p>So I think that is a lost opportunity.  But again, they will take a look at  policies.  They will turn out to the caucuses on Monday night and we'll see  what the Iowa voters do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, a busy couple days for you.

You  know, I'm an African-American quarterback that may scare a lot of people  because they haven't seen nothing that they can compare me to.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Cam Newton will become the sixth black quarterback to start the big  game 28 years since Doug Williams became the first to win it in Super Bowl  22.</p><p>Now look at what Cam Newton's head coach Ron Rivera said yesterday.   \"People should be scared of a quarterback with his skill set more than  anything else.  I don't think he wants to be known as an African-American  quarterback.  I think he wants to be known as a quarterback -- and a great  one at that.\"</p><p>Do some people dismiss Cam Newton because of the color of his skin or  because he is just so darn good and unlike any other player we have seen?   Peyton Manning can irritate me with all his histrionics sometimes, but Cam  Newton can also rub me the wrong way with his childish antics.  But he is  who he is and he is not hiding from it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he says he's not going to hide from it going up against  Super Bowl 50.  Why should he?  </p><p>MAX:  He really shouldn't.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  People don't dislike him.  It is -- Cam I will  speak to you.  It is not because you are black.  It is because you are so  good.  What is he?  6'5\", he's 260 pounds -- </p><p>MAX:  He's built like a linebacker and a running back. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and he floats like a butterfly and he stings things like a  bee.  And I love your end zone celebration.  Keep them coming because if it  was me and I was that talented, which I will never be, never have been, not  even in my next eight lives, I would be humping the turf when I celebrated  as he did.  </p><p>AMOROSO:  That would be fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I would like to see that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would be rolling down like a bug on my back.</p><p>MAX:  Good visual there.</p><p>Does Dagen's opinion represent, you know, most of Americans and I don't  know if it does because I mean I'm looking at stories from Deadspin from  not long ago -- \"Scared white people running out of reasons to hate Cam  Newton.\"  </p><p>BUSCH:  You know, the thing is -- look race is a huge story in America  after Ferguson.  I come from Illinois in Chicago and we have unbelievable  problems there right now with murders.  Now it is representative I think  he's kind of representative of that and very sensitive to it and rightly  so.</p><p>But, you know, we go back to when Doug Williams was the quarterback.  </p><p>MAX:  That was the story.</p><p>BUSCH:  These are all the same stories.  </p><p>MAX:  It's not new.</p><p>That was -- that was the story.  Now, it's just -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's the fourth black quarterback to start a Super Bowl in a  row.  </p><p>MAX:  In a row.  Fourth straight -- so it really isn't a story.  And as  Coach Rivera said, you know, he wants to be known -- he doesn't want to be  known as the Hispanic coach.</p><p>In North Carolina a poll was taken last week.  And it's interesting is that  Democrats say that Cam Newton is their favorite player by 45 to 19 ratio.   And Republicans say Luke Kuechly, who's white is their favorite player, 34  to 27.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I question that.  45 touchdowns, plays, 35 passing, 10 rushing - - get down.  MVP -- baby.  </p><p>MAX:  Like we say we mock what we don't understand.  I think -- we've never  seen somebody like Cam Newton quite as an NFL quarterback.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hate Tom Brady and it's not because he is white.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  It's because he's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just Tom Brady and he plays for the Patriots -- that's why.  </p><p>BUSCH:  Well, it's unfortunate.  It does distract a little from the game,  which I think the Panthers have just been unbelievable.  I mean they score  as many points as they have, I don't know if that's ever happened with two  games in a row.  I don't know.  If Denver's defense doesn't show up in that  game, it is going to get ugly fast.  </p><p>MAX:  It's going to be a great football game but I do see that Carolina's  going to win maybe by two to three -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I'm rooting for -- </p><p>BUSCH:  Yes.  They're going to outscore them.  They just -- I don't think - - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why I'm rooting for the Broncos.  I am going to root for  the Broncos -- emotional favorite, sentimental favorite.  Kind of have to  go for him but Cam is going to crush everybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff you guys.

He will tell us what drove the growth there and the ever evolving state of  the healthcare business.</p><p>Back in a moment on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR:  Welcome back; I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Thursday, January 28th.  With me this morning, JPMorgan Assets Managements,  Anastasia Amorosa; Gauge Communications, Andy Busch; and, former Home Depot  and Chrysler CEO, Bob Nardelli in the studio this morning.  First, though,  your top stories it's 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  (HEADLINES)</p><p>Let's look at markets because were watching crude oil once again this  morning.  Take a look: trading well off the 12-year low set earlier this  month.  Rallying today, another half percent at $32.44.  Phil Flynn is in  Chicago at the CME Group.  Okay, so we're back at $32, above $32 a barrel.  What does that say you, Phil? </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It says to me that we're seeing a lot of  capitulation on a lot of fronts.  You know, what it's saying to me is that  when prices went down low, when they crashed earlier in the year, it did a  lot of damage.  Because of that, we heard an announcement from the biggest  shale producers in this country that hey, we can't keep doing the this.  We  have to cut back spending.  We had to cut back production. </p><p>Continental Resources said, Listen, we are not making money to innovate.   We are squeezing about as much blood out of a turnip as we can right now  and we're not going to be able to find new ways to do it with prices at  these levels.  So those warnings from the U.S. producers are (inaudible),  but it's not just U.S. producers, it's OPEC; it's across the board.   Everybody is talking about capitulation of potential output cut.  That's  what you usually hear when we hit a bottom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Phil; thank you.  Phil Flynn with the latest there.   Tepid growth concerns, of course, weighing on global stocks all year.  </p><p>My next guest, however, says there's nothing to worry about.  There is  clearly no recession coming in the country.  We want to bring in Mendon  Capital Advisors Portfolio Manager, Anton Schutz.  Anton, it's good see  you.</p><p>ANTON SCHUTZ, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CAPITAL ADVISORS:  Always a pleasure to be  here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you manage money and specifically you invest in financials.   Okay, I want to kick you off with that, this discussion, because financials  have gotten their lunch eaten - ouch - this year, not necessarily all the  financials because I know you like the small and midcap names, but what the  heck is going on with these major banks this year?</p><p>SCHUTZ:  I think you've got multiple factors that are going on, but the way  these stocks have traded, they reflect all the damage being done from a  full recession; not a depression like we had in 2008.  People are already  leaping to oh my goodness here we go again, just from the first couple of  weeks out of the gate.</p><p>Energy is a problem for banks in Texas, no doubt about it.  Energy --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've made all the loans.</p><p>SCHUTZ:  They've made a lot of the loans.  The big banks have really big  energy loans as well, but it's two to three-percent of their portfolios;  manageable.  </p><p>ANDY BUSCH, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, GAUGE COMMUNICATIONS:  Right.</p><p>SCHUTZ:  You know, Jamie Dimon said, well, oil goes here we write another  $500 million off.  Well, JPMorgan only earns $5-7 billion dollars a quarter  so it's not exactly a giant problem for them.  It doesn't dilute book  value.</p><p>BUSCH:  Right, but I think the story is more on the net interest margin,  right, because that's what we were anticipating as the Fed began to raise  interest rates.  Now that seems to be off the table.  Talk about that.   What's the outlook there? </p><p>SCHUTZ:  So if you think about it, you know, I've had some people say, you  know, well banks reflected that.  Well they didn't because they really  weren't up last year.  </p><p>BUSCH:  Right, they were down 3.5-percent.</p><p>SCHUTZ:  They didn't reflect that last year and these stocks now traded  lower multiples than they did two years ago and the book values are higher,  their earnings are higher.  I think there was some foreselling that went  on.  I think the sovereign wealth funds are majorly responsible.  They  loved U.S. banks, I'm not naming which one, but they were major holders of  U.S. banks. and some of that selling that was going on was clearly like we  don't care.  When Bank of America came out and reported good earnings and  went down that day, I was shocked; because I said, all right.  The stocks  going to be up five percent today because, you know, the numbers were  definitely good enough.  It's been beaten to death and then it went down  and it continued to go down.  I went, okay.  Somebody is just selling for  the sake of selling.  You've got all these technical CTA's out there  selling stocks, period.  Quite frankly, front running, not selling.  So,  you know, the reversal can be just as savage as its been vicious on the way  down.</p><p>BUSCH:  That's with Bank of America putting another billion in the  reserves.  I was with you, I thought they had a good quarter; very  conservative; building their reserves; and they still got whacked. </p><p>SCHUTZ:  For no good reason other than they existed, and that's kind of  what's happened.  I mean, a lot of people scratch their heads and say why  is this happening?  I mean, if you look at the Texas banks, actually a  bunch of them have been purporting numbers slightly better and there was a  big short squeeze on a couple of them yesterday.  One of them announced a  big buy-back yesterday. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the other trend in your world is the consolidation. When  you look at the small and midcap names, a lot of deals happening.  You  think a continues?</p><p>SCHULTZ:  Well absolutely, and if we don't get interest rate increases it  actually accelerates -</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  -- because cost cutting is one of these monster things that the  industry still has to do.  </p><p>BUSCH:  That's space though is really interesting.  Anything from $50  billion under, that non-SIFI space is really exciting.  I think $20 billion  is really where it's at because -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Non-systemically important financial institution.</p><p>BUSCH:  Right, and so the regulation from Dodd-Frank continue to hurt  bigger banks but it's the small space where you can accumulate in assets  and that's where I think growth is interesting; </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, former CEO, HOME DEPOT/CHRYSER:  it's in the fracking  industry, right; we had well over 2000 rigs.  We're down to around 450.  I  think, Maria, you're right; you're going to see a lot of consolidation in  that.  Field services will be consolidated to get costs down. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So some of this consolidation is going to be forced because of  the oil space?</p><p>SCHUTZ:  Oh, absolutely, you know, in places like Louisiana and Texas that  have real direct exposure, Oklahoma.  They're going to be some companies  raise their hands and go, get me out of here.   There will be some capital  raising going on.  There will be some investors that get out maybe a little  too early, it's going to be tough to tell, but I love the Southeast.   Economic growth; phenomenal.  Wherever it is, the Carolinas, Atlanta - </p><p>NARDELLI:  Even the big guys are letting a lot of land go, you know, the  E&amp;P, you don't drill you lose it.  A lot of them are quietly letting the  land go back.</p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JPMORGAN ASSETS MANAGEMENTS:   Clearly the banks have some headwinds to them, and whether it's the Fed not  raising rates and it's effecting that interest margins or it's the energy  exposure, but probably the biggest tailwind for the banking sector is  growth in consumer credit; and it's been phenomenal, right?  5 or 6- percent, it's been wrapping up.  Are we seeing the topping of consumer  credit growth here or do you think there is more of a runway here?</p><p>SCHUTZ:  I still think there's some runway here.  Let's not forget that all  the bad of energy is good for the consumer.  Some of the spending we've  seen in the consumers, in the credit card numbers have reflected lack of  spending because they're not paying as much for their gasoline.  They are  able to allocate it elsewhere.  They've allocated it savings as well.   Their balance sheets are much, much healthier than prior to the crisis.  So  I still think we have some pretty good growth in the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a good point, in terms of the lending.  Yes,  lending looks good, but, Anton, here is my question.  Are we seeing  increasing lending and that money is going towards capex spending, where  these companies want to invest in their business, or is it going toward  M&amp;A?  </p><p>SCHUTZ:  Well, so you think about the Capex spending that's not happening  in Energy.  I mean, all the budgets have been cut way back, so that's - you  know, when you look at the broader numbers you're seeing that sift through.   If you remove of that there's still some pretty good growth in a lot of  parts of this economy.  If you remove the Capex that was allocated towards  the drilling. </p><p>You know, loan growth is quite good, it's quite robust.  I mean, were  talking 6-8-percent loan growth, particularly on the smaller guy.  I mean,  JPMorgan's showing that kind of growth as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, but, I mean, is it loan growth because of M&amp;A?</p><p>SCHUTZ:  No, it's -- the bond market has taken a lot of that, no doubt  about it.  It's loan growth for actually doing nuts and bolts and  manufacturing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHUTZ:  We're seeing a lot of relocation of foreign companies to the  United States because of cheap energy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Bob just said.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your favorite stock now? </p><p>SCHUTZ:  I love New York Community and I love Key Quirk.  They have both  beaten and they have both done deals.  They're trading at forward earnings  that are cheap and large dividend yields.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anton, good to see you.  </p><p>SCHUTZ:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Anton Schutz of Mendon Capital.   Up next, my exclusive interview with the CEO pharma giant Eli Lilly.  Eli  Lilly involved in everything from cancer treatment to diabetes.  We're  going to talk about it.  Then, big news for amazon, recruiting some A-list  talent ahead of the Super Bowl; we'll tell you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; earnings alert.  Eli Lilly posting fourth-quarter  earnings of .78 cents a share on revenue of just under $5.4 billion, that a  result of higher sales of its new diabetes drug and a generous shareholders  reward program; $3 billion in buy-backs and dividends.  </p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business Network Exclusive, the Eli Lilly  Chairman &amp; CEO John Lechlieter.  John, good to see you; always wonderful to  have you on the program.  Welcome.</p><p>JOHN LECHLIETER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, ELI LILLY:  Good morning; Happy New Year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you characterize things; what drove the quarter?  </p><p>LECHLIETER:  Well, we got 5-percent reported growth.  A big part of that  comes from the impact of owning the Novartis Animal Health.  We closed that  deal with Novartis early in 2015.  We now have the third largest animal  health business in the world to complement our pharmaceutical business.   Then, on the pharma side, that growth was led by two of our new products,  Trulicity, this is our diabetes medicine, and Cyramza, for the treatment of  various forms of cancer.  So, we're starting to see the impact of these new  product launches that began in 2014. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- tell me about the cancer treatment and  specifically where the cancer is, in terms of that drug and what it  targets. </p><p>LECHLIETER:  Well Cyramza is the first drug came out of our in-clone  acquisition back in 2008.  In succession, in 2014 we achieved approval for  treatment of gastric cancer and second line, both the drug along and in  combination with other chemotherapy; then subsequently we received approval  for treatment of lung cancer in the second line, as well; and then  colorectal cancer following that.  So three different kinds of cancers that  all seem to respond in some way to this particular drug. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really important stuff, and, of course, diabetes.  We all know  that the leading killer in the U.S. is heart disease.  In terms of the  diabetes drug, Americans are wondering when they're going to get a break,  in terms of pricing.  What can you tell us about price of these drugs and  your efforts to keep prices affordable?</p><p>LECHLIETER:  Well, I think it's something that we think about and pay a lot  of attention to, Maria.  When you look at our results for the year our  reported sales grew two-percent, that was depressed about six-percent by  exchange rate but the remainder, seven-percent of our growth in 2015 came  from volume and only one-percent of our growth came from price.   </p><p>I think the price of medicines needs to be kept in perspective.  Today,  four out of five prescriptions that Americans get from the drugstore are  generic drugs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LECHLIETER:  In other words, generic versions of medicines that we  pioneered, typically available at a very low price.  We're concerned, and  we want Americans to have access to our medicines.  This is why we have  various access programs in place; it's also why the industry, Maria, is  consistently supported of the American people getting the access to quality  insurance -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LECHLIETER:  -- because we know how important medicines are for overall  health care.  </p><p>You know, another thing I would like to say is, the discussion today tends  to be about expensive medicines.  What's really expensive is disease, okay.   Alzheimer's disease is going to cost this country hundreds of billions, if  not trillions of dollars, left on its current trajectory through 2050.  We  have been working for 27 years, investing billions ourselves, in  Alzheimer's research.  Nothing has come out of that yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LECHLIETER:  We are hopeful, but I think this is what we all aspire to and  I think this has to be a part of this discussion and debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think this is a great point that you're making, John,  because we all know that Alzheimer's is one of those diseases that we are  still learning about. </p><p>LECHLIETER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're learning so much about the brain.  If you live until 85,  apparently, one in two people will get Alzheimer's and there is not a cure.    I know you are collaborating with Roche Diagnostics on this diagnostic  tool.  I don't know how much that would go for, in terms of if you were to  the see a cure for Alzheimer's.  </p><p>I've got Anastasia Amoroso here from JPMorgan, but this is the kind of  thing, Anastasia, that people say, don't tell me about caps on drugs  because we want get the investment from the private sector to actually  continue working it and find that cure for Alzheimer's.</p><p>AMOROSO:  That's right; I mean, drug pricing is a very important issue for  the consumer but, again, this is about financial results.  So, John, my  question to you on the financial results aspect, I know foreign exchange  was a big impact on earnings last quarter, the U.S. dollar still up about  nine-percent year-over-year.  Is it still a big impact?  Can you quantify  that for us?  I guess the broader question is, we know there's an effects  translation impact, but is this also deterring your revenue generation as  you do sell to quite a few other countries?</p><p>LECHLIETER:  Well, I think, as you know, early last year we saw almost an  unprecedented strengthening of the dollar against a lot of the currencies  that are important to us.  That has slowed down somewhat; however, currency  translation, the stronger dollar continues to be something of a drag for  companies like Lilly that have roughly 50-percent of our sales outside the  U.S.</p><p>Having said that, I think like many businesses, we run our business trying  to see through the currency fluctuations, which are inevitable and which  are difficult to predictable and control.  Just as currency, a stronger  dollar can hurt us on the revenue line, it helps us on the expense line;  and depending on how it moves, can help us on at our gross margin line.  So  we have a little bit in natural hedging at Lilly, but there's no question,  when you look back in 2015, you know, this took a billion dollars or so out  of our revenue, the fact that the Euro and Yen, in particular, were weaker. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the odds that we go into recession this year, john?</p><p>LECHLIETER:  Um, you know, I'm not an economist.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, but what does your animal health business tell you?   You see a lot.</p><p>LECHLIETER:  Well, I don't think we're going to -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>LECHLIETER:  I don't have a sense that we're going to go in a recession  this year.  I think if you would have asked any of us two years ago what's  going to be the economic impact of gasoline at $1.45 at the pump, I think  we would have said it's going to help the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>LECLIETER:  Now we are seeing there's also a down side, in the energy  sector, etcetera; but I think overall the fundamentals are pretty good and  I've got confidence in our economy, in the U.S. economy in particular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, good to see you.  Thanks so much for stopping by, we  appreciate your time this morning.</p><p>LECHLIETER:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Lechlieter joining us, CEO of Eli Lilly.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the Zika virus confirmed in another part of the United States.   Cheryl Casone with that story now; Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: (HEADLINES) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; we're with Bob Nardelli today, former CEO of  Chrysler, Home Depot.  Bob, how do you see things right now, in terms of  the economy?  Give us your list if what's working and what isn't.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Well it's very mixed.  I mean, we just heard from Eli Lilly.  We  saw Ford.  I think the auto industry is the bright spot, pharmaceutical is  a bright spot.  We've talked about those before; but I think we have some  pressure out there.  I think what we're seeing a lot of potential  disruption in a variety of, I'll call them verticals.  Internal disruption  through innovation, innovate or evaporate.  </p><p>We're seeing a lot of activists' force consolidations.  You look at Dow and  DuPont, even DuPont having a very bad quarter but trying to come together  to be big, bigger.  You know, share to win and then separate into three  business. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazing how successful Nelson Peltz was on that.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Very successful.  You look at Ed Green, who is also the Chairman  of Tyco, along with the CEO of DuPont and Dow.  Tyco now joining with  Johnson Control, will also be an inversion, right.  So we're seeing a lot  of that.  We're seeing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So one was in innovate, an innovation -</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of disruption.  What's your second one?</p><p>NARDELLI:  Then you have the activist that's coming with it, and then  you're seeing a lot of productivity this year, Maria, through software.  If  you look at system software to drive productivity, it's two times the GDP  last year.  So companies are vying through digital transformation as a way  to drive productivity and earnings.  They have to find another way to wring  it out.  They're still doing the stock buy-back.  They're joining forces to  get larger base of customers, broader portfolios.  Taking costs out of the  back offices.  So I think that's what we're going to see this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true, because when you don't have growth, Anastasia, you  acquire growth.</p><p>AMAROSO:  Yes, you do; and to Bob's point, very importantly, now that we  actually are seeing somewhat higher wages, they seem to have accelerated  since the beginning of last year, how do you still deliver those profit  margins?  Maybe the issue is you pay a little bit more in wages but you  replace some of that labor, unfortunately, with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Automation, yes.</p><p>NARDELLI:  General Motors, right, buying Lyft.  So you look at the  adjacencies that serve the customer.  You know, they're trying to make the  customer a sector of one now, with that kind of intimacy and customer  centricity, I think, is what we're going to see, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting stuff.  Bob, great to see you today.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much; Bob Nardelli joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning everybody, I'm Maria Bartiromo; welcome back.

First though, the  markets right now. (HEADLINES) </p><p>Republican Presidential Candidates getting ready to faceoff tonight in the  Fox News Debate in Iowa, the last GOP Debate before Monday's Iowa caucuses.   Blake Burman is in Des Moines with the preview of what to expect this  evening.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Maria; good morning to you as  well. Donald Trump continues to maintain that he will not be at this debate  tonight, the very last debate before the Iowa caucuses.  Still, this is a  hugely important debate on the Fox News Channel tonight.  Keep in mind that  of these candidates have been campaigning here for months in Iowa, some  longer than that, over a year, and this is the final push before caucus  goers head to the polls, four days from now, Monday night.  </p><p>There will be two debates, the first one at 9:00 o'clock. Seven people on  that stage.  It will be Cruz and Rubio, center stage.  They will be flanked  by Carson and Bush, Christy and Kasich and Rand Paul will once again  reappear on the 9:00 o'clock debate stage.  It all starts at 7:00 o'clock  with four candidates trying to make a good impression, a good final  impression as well, Fiorina, Huckabee and Santorum.  Jim Gilmore returns on  the debate stage in that case.  </p><p>I spoke with an advisor, Maria, yesterday to the campaign of Ted Cruz and  they told me they expect their guy to take fire from all over, considering  he will be the frontrunner on that stage later tonight, especially, they  say, from Marco Rubio.  Still, as it relates to Trump, that adviser told  me, expect to not be let off the hook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX) REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  At the end of the  day it's not really that Donald is afraid of Megan, it's not that he's  afraid of Marc or Sean or Rush.  It's not that he's afraid of me, he's  afraid of you.  </p><p>[Applause]</p><p>CRUZ:  He doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa  about how his record doesn't match what he's selling. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  And, Maria, while this is a national debate on national  television, you can expect many of the talking points of the issues from  the candidates to be focused directly, laser focused, on Iowa and what the  people here want to hear.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's just extraordinary, Blake; really.  No one has ever seen  anything like this.  This is just unbelievable.</p><p>BURMAN:  It's every day.  Every day it gets different, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Blake, thank you.  Who will be the standout in Iowa  tonight?  Joining us is National Political Reporter for \"Real Clear  Politics\", Rebecca Berg.  Dagen McDowell also joining the conversation.   Dagen, Rebecca, good to see you both.  Thank you so much.  Let me start  with you, Rebecca.  Who do you think wins with Trump's absence tonight? </p><p>REBECCA BERG, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"REAL CLEAR POLITICS\":  Well,  maybe Trump, and that's really the question tonight, Maria; can Donald  Trump still command the stage without even being on it?  I think it's going  to be a challenge for Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and some of the other leaders  in this race to prove that they are potential frontrunners and that they  can outshine Donald Trump, even when he is commanding media attention.   It's really going to be a challenge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's really interesting that you say that because for so long,  and Dagen weigh in on this, for so long we need to talk about Donald Trump  needs to getting more specific; we need to hear more substance in terms of  the issues.  Here the candidates have an opportunity to do a debate without  him, to offer that kind of substance and Rebecca is saying, well, maybe he  will still command the stage even though he's not there. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDET:  If he's not there, and my prediction is  he shows up at the last minute.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think so?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you want to keep this reality show going, anybody who's  watched, again, \"The Real Housewives,\" NeeNee Leekes, surprise appearance,  comes back; Kim Zoltziak, surprise appearance, comes back.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He can have his own spinoff show.  He's still got to be on the  thing that made his, well, great; and that is the republican race for the  nomination.  So I think there's still a chance that he pops back. </p><p>I love how Cruz is taking him on, leading up to the debate.  The Cruz  campaign set up a website called duckingdonald.com saying \"come back\" and  they're selling hats, \"make Donald debate again.\"   </p><p>[laughter]</p><p>ANDY BUSCH, EDITOR, BUSCH UPDATE:  I would love to get a hat like that;  that would be awesome.  I hope they take, you know, the time to really beat  him up because, you know, if you do some analysis on what his policies are,  especially on the trade side, I mean, there's hugely populist but they are  the worst thing to really be enacted. If he got elected and he said he was  going to do some of the things like, raise tariffs 45-percent on NAFTA  countries, I mean, we could ignite a global trade war that would come at  the worst time. </p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JPMORGAN FUNDS GLOBAL MARKET  INSIGHTS STRATEGY:  He backed away from that, Andy.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He back away from that and said I didn't mean 45.  It just  means if they don't do what they're supposed to be doing - </p><p>BUSH:  But even with his stance on China, I mean, he's beat them up  constantly.  This is not good.</p><p>AMOROSO:  But he's got a point. He's got a point there, maybe not on the  tariff side, but he's got a point that if you're an American company right  now, if you're a Caterpillar, for example, trying to sell tractors to  Brazil or China or Japan, you're so not competitive because of the value of  the U.S. dollar.  Now, maybe this is not - the way to fix that is not for  tariffs, it's not even maybe through fiscal policy, but this is a real  issue that actually our companies are grappling with.  We're seeing that in  earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that's the thing.  I mean, he brings up real issues; the  same situation with immigration.  I mean, it may not be the solution that  people necessarily see as working, but he brings up these issues and then  it gets everybody talking about them, Rebecca, which is what you're  alluding to that he'll be on the stage anyway.</p><p>BERG:  Exactly, and so I expect that some of the candidates are going to  have to answer for Donald Trump, still answer for the policies that he has  brought into this debate, which puts them really at a disadvantage because  what Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and some of the others wanted to do tonight was  make this about them, not about Donald Trump and once again, he's stealing  the spotlight, and that doesn't help them at all. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I cannot wait to see what Marco Rubio can do with Ted Cruz,  because in your debate, and the one that you and Neil did, the end of the  debate, it was well after 11:00 o'clock, Rubio all of a sudden came to life  and hammered Ted Cruz over and over about his conservative inconsistencies  and it was some real knockout blows, but he has to do that a lot earlier.   He has to bring the heat toward the beginning of the debate.  Don't wait  until a lot of people have gone to sleep. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can anybody on that stage tonight take it beyond where Donald  Trump has been?  I mean, he's already at 40-percent?</p><p>BUSCH:  I - well I think there's a lot of opportunity for Rubio because he  needs guys to drop out.  I mean, he needs Kasich to drop out, Bush,  Christie, those are more of the main-stream guys.  Those votes will go to  Rubio; they won't go to Cruz.  So it's really Cruz and Trump that are going  after each other.  Rubio is going to be on the side.  So Rubio just needs  to hit Cruz as hard like Dagen was saying.  I think that's what I'm going  to be watching for.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If they talk about Trump too much, they're the losers. </p><p>BUSCH:  Totally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>BUSCH:  That's a great point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rebecca, anybody you see particularly emerging right now  without Trump there tonight, aside from Rubio as we have been talking  about?</p><p>BERG:  Sure; well, Maria, I will be watching Ted Cruz on that stage.  He's  a great debater, as we have all seen.   Obviously he won championships for  that when he was a student at Princeton.  So we know that he's good in this  setting.  Without Donald Trump he'll have a chance to really shine I think.   Of course, the prize is Iowa.  He's in second place in some polls, tied in  others.  So he really needs to perform in this debate to win the caucus on  Monday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well stated.  Big opportunity for the others on stage. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They better come loaded for bear and they better have worked on  their debate prep, I mean, real serious debate. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Rebecca, thank you.  Good to see you.  Dagen,  we'll see you later on in the program.</p><p>BERG:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in to the Republican Debate tonight, on the Fox  News Channel.  This is the first debate starting at 7:00 p.m. Eastern and  the second debate begins at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  Don't miss it.  Also, our  all-star coverage of the Iowa caucuses this Monday, beginning right here,  on Mornings with Maria, all day long.  Then, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Neil  Cavuto will be live from Iowa; so don't miss Neil at 8:00 p.m.</p><p>Earnings alert this morning:  Facebook reporting after the close yesterday.   The social-media giant posted a profit of more than a billion dollars,  first time ever.  Stock has rallied more than 11-percent in the premarket  on that earnings' news of a billion dollars.  Some key takeaways, mobile  80-percent of renew, up nearly 70-percent from a year earlier.  So they are  finding traction on mobile.  Facebook also says it generates $3.73 for  every one of its now 1.59 billion users, that's up 33-percent.</p><p>Anastasia, big week for Facebook.  What do you think?</p><p>AMOROSO:  It was a huge quarter for Facebook.  If you look at their  earnings this time around versus this time last year they basically doubled  their earnings but it's coming on exceptionally strong revenue growth. So,  for example, a renew growth, year over year, for the entire year was about  43-percent.  So I think it's an example of a company that can do well in  this environment, that (inaudible) so many companies.  So this is a company  that is technology, consumer, cross section and they're doing amazingly  well.  </p><p>Just one other thing to mention on Facebook is that if you look at their  daily average users, it's a pretty good mix between U.S., Canada, Asia- Pacific and so forth, many international regions.  If you look at their  revenue, the majority of ad revenue actually comes from the United States.   So, again, we talked about the high value of the U.S. dollar and the fact  that the revenues are not impacted by that, because the revenue does come  from here.  I think puts it apart from everybody else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you see a long runway, given the fact that only a portion is  coming from the U.S.?  Perhaps that opens up for more potential, in terms  of revenue coming from around the world?</p><p>AMOROSO:  Absolutely, I think Facebook is probably pursuing the same  strategy in other places as they have with the United States, which is  focus on user growth first and then revenue growth second.  Remember, when  Facebook first went public, everybody beat up on it because they didn't  have the revenues to put out, the advertising revenues to put up.  Well  they fixed that and then some and I suspect they'll do that internationally  as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>BUSCH:  I was going to say, Facebook ads, LinkedIn ads, Google ads, that is  the space that really is driving revenues for these companies and when you  get into digital marketing, this is where it's at.  You can actually see  where these ads go, you can put hard numbers on them and that's what people  who are advertising trying to figure out, they want to hit your audience;  you want to see you spend really actually, you know, convert and get sales.   That's what you can do with these devices, so it's awesome. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what they invested in over the last couple of years,  these measurement systems to be able to say to advertisers, yes, here is  who you're touching; here is who is actually active when they go on the  site.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, and I think that's - I mean, mobile doesn't surprise me, but I  that's - they own this space, that's what's so cool about Facebook.  That's  what I love about them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting stuff.  All right, we'll take a short break.   Coming up, a snowy week could not stop the Fed.  Why new questions are  being raised right now about whether a second rate increase would come in  march.  A lot of people pushing to later in the year.  Plus, more on  Facebook's growth plans; how the company will let you convey a wide range  of emotions.  We'll tell you about it; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back; breaking news, new arrests in connection with the  three escaped California inmates.  Cheryl Casone with that story and the  other headlines, right now.  What a story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, it really is.  It's becoming more of  a \"Shawshank Redemption\" story at this point, Maria. (HEADLINES) </p><p>Finally, this morning, Wal-Mart's decision to close more than 150 stores in  the U.S., starting today, is having ripple effects across the country;  according to a new study by the Associated Press, once shut, 15,000  residents in more than 31 towns, in 15 states no longer have access to  fresh produce and to meat.  These closures also going to create three new  \"food deserts\", that's according to the federal government.  Interesting  because all of those ma and pa places that were shut down when Wal-Mart  came to town, they're all gone.  So now you've got these empty cities,  basically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  This is really tough news.  I mean, I think, on  the one hand it represents really a tough economy, obviously, for Wal-Mart  to shut these stores but the implications, in terms of the no-access to  fresh food, Andy.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yeah, I think that's a problem.  I'm out in Illinois, Chicago, and  we have problems with grocery deserts in the city of Chicago, and they've  really tried to -- especially on the south side, and they've really try to  push these through but I'm just wondering, as far as Wal-Mart goes, and the  bigger story may be that because consumers actually have more disposable  income, through lower gasoline prices, they're not shopping as much at Wal- Mart.  So I don't know -- this is an interesting -- it kind of goes against  that because these are really in the areas where you think that they really  would need it, lower cost and everything else.  I wonder if you step back  nationally, maybe that's part of the problem with Wal-Mart.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, I don't know.  I think part of it is people are moving to  things like amazon.  I mean, you can get almost, sometimes, better deals on  amazon, especially if you have prime, you can have toilet paper delivered  and everything else. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And even fresh food, right?</p><p>CASONE:  And fresh food.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, right.</p><p>CASONE:  So, you know, I think that the Wal-Mart -- like every other  retailer in America is dealing with the online revolution and how do you  combat that, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p>AMOROSO:  I think both of those forces are in play.  You know, Andy's  right, people are saving 50, $60 maybe more dollars a month on lower  gasoline prices and we know one place that it's going to is buying up a  higher-end grocery store cart or maybe buying up on restaurants.  So I  think it's definitely one of the explanations, but amazon has got to be the  other one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing though, they're saving the money, right, and  the savings rate is 5.6-percent.  They're not actually spending the money.</p><p>BUSCH:  Certainly not at Wal-Mart.</p><p>AMOROSO:  Yes.</p><p>BUSCH:  That's for sure.</p><p>AMOROSO:  We find that people are spending in very selectively and really  who benefits actually is the grocers as well as the restaurants but  apparently not Wal-Mart.</p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, right.  Sure.</p><p>[Laughter]</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thank you.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a short break.  The Federal Reserve acknowledging that the  economy has, in fact, slowed down, at the end of last year.  Is a March  increase rate off the table at this point?  Talk about rates next.  And if  you ate at Wendy's recently you'd better check your bank statement.  We'll  tell you why the restaurant is urging customers to keep an eye on their  credit card bill; coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching crude oil this morning trading  well of the 12-year low set this month, after a key data point show that a  chance of production cut is on the horizon.  Phil Flynn Is at the CME  Group. Phil, good morning to you.  $32.63, not bad.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It is, I think it is almost 25-percent off  the recent low, which is a pretty good comeback considering that market.  It's looking more and more like capitulation.  You make a good point,  production cuts come in a lot of ways, rumors from (inaudible) yesterday  that we are going to have an OPEC summit between Russia and OPEC and other  Non-OPEC producers cut production, got this market going yesterday.  It  didn't know how to take the Fed.   They have kind of a mixed reaction.   Today, instead of oil following the stock market, they're going to focus  again on the dollar. So it looks like the Fed statement, the possibility  that they're acknowledging the slowing global economy, going to start  impacting oil more.  I think oil can get away from that direct relationship  with stocks and start looking at that inverse relationship with the dollar.   So I think that's where we are at today.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of one move above $32, but Anastasia, I mean, do we  believe this, that in fact there's going to be enough of a production cut  to actually impact the supply?  I mean, that's the issue for these markets? </p><p>AMOROSO:  In the U.S., yes; absolutely.  I think we will start to see  production decline.  In OPEC and Russia, I'm not so sure; that was one of  the headlines this morning.  But, in the U.S., the reality is if you look  at shale oil production as percentage, or as a fraction of overall  production, it's more than half; it's a meaningful share.  </p><p>The issue with shale oil is the decline rate is a lot faster than it is for  conventional oil.  So, for example, it's about a 30-percent decline rate  every single year.  So if we have about 5.2 million barrels a day in shale  oil production, then you can say that a third of that will be depleted. The  third of that will be the decline rate so far this year this year.  So,  yes, as we progress, we suspect in the second half of the year, we will  start to see faster production decline out of the U.S.  </p><p>The wild card is going to be OPEC.  The wild card is going to be Saudi  Arabia, and now Iran.  Will they make up, and then some, for what U.S.  gives up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they've been unwilling to do any cuts, in terms of the  Saudi's --</p><p>BUSCH:  Well the Iranians are going to pump.  Rouhani's in France, right?   They're signing contracts.  They're going to pump a lot of oil, as fast as  they can. It's really a question of outside the U.S., because the U.S. will  shut down, who is going to cut first?  That's what we don't know.  Russia  is just bleeding money right now on oil. </p><p>AMOROSO:  And Saudi Arabia. </p><p>BUSCH:  Yes, they're all hurting, so we'll see.  I mean, they need the  money. Can they cut to get the price up is the question, and would the U.S.  remain on the sidelines and not increase production as the price goes up?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why would they give a cut, given the fact that this is their  product? This is their - and their economies are, you know, close to dead?</p><p>BUSCH:  They need the money.</p><p>AMOROSO:  The U.S. is clearly - they want the U.S. to be the swing  producer.  They're forcing the U.S. to be the swing producer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>AMOROSO:  Because when U.S. production declines they're going to be left.   Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be left with a greater market share.  So they  will be the ultimate beneficiaries of that price going up again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's the Federal Reserve.  The Fed kicked off 2016  by keeping rates the same.  Will we see these rates stay lower for longer?   More on that, what to expect from the federal reserve this year next; next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Welcome  back.  I am Maria Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, January 28.  With me this  morning, JPMorgan Asset Management's Anastasia Amoroso and Engage  Communications' Andy Bush.</p><p>First though your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the east coast.  Republican  candidates gearing up to tonight's debate in Iowa.  The event hosted by our  sister network, Fox News Channel, is the final GOP debate before the Iowa  caucuses begin on Monday.</p><p>Frontrunner Donald Trump still says he will not participate in tonight's  event even on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" last night and explaining his decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS:  I submit to you that you need to change and get  away from the personal they hurt my feelings, they are unfair to me and  make it about then, the folks.  Not about you.  You elevate them to a place  where you could win this if you do that.  Am I crazy?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You are not crazy at all, but it  is about them.  It's about making America great again.  That is why I'm  doing this.  It's not because I want the position.  It's because I know the  potential of this country.  How great the country can be.  Our leader is  not doing the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be sure to tune in tonight for the Fox News/Google debate that  begins tonight at 7:00p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Onto the markets we go, we are looking at solid gains here in the U.S. this  morning.  Futures indicating a gain of about 60 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial Average after the two-day fed meeting ended yesterday.</p><p>And the fed raised questions about the next time it will raise interest  rates, basically saying that the economy slowed down at the end of last  year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower, though, across the board.  You  got some fractional moves to the downside to the tune of about half a  percent to 1 percent on the FT or the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index in  Germany.</p><p>Overnight in Asia, another session top for the Chinese stock market.  The  Shanghai Composite down nearly 3 percent.  Nikkei average in Japan down  three quarters of a percent ahead of the Central Bank meeting.  The Bank of  Japan coming out on Friday this week.</p><p>Facebook is the one to watch today.  The social media giant handily beat  earnings expectations last night came out with revenue up better than 50  percent just in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Take a look at that stock.  It's driven by mobility.  The stock jumped in  the premarket this morning and we will see money moving into Facebook this  morning as people are impressed by the mobile improvements at Facebook.</p><p>New cases meanwhile of Zika virus confirmed in the United States.  There  are now at least six cases in the U.S. including in New York.  Delta  Airlines joining United and American allowing passengers to cancel or  postpone trips to areas that are affected by this outbreak.</p><p>The Federal Reserve signalling some concern yesterday about market  turbulence and slow economic growth overseas.  It did not rule out another  gradual rate increase in March, but very few people are believing it.</p><p>I want to bring \"The Wall Street Journal's\" chief economic correspondent,  Jon Hilsenrath and Ameriprise Financial's chief market strategist, here in  the studio, David Joy.  Gentlemen, good to see you.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>Jon, first, take us off, what did you learn from the fed yesterday?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, WSJ CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I learned that  they are very worried about how the economy is doing and how it is a fact  that in particular by overseas developments in market turbulence.</p><p>You know, they came out of their December rate increase expressing  confidence about the outlook for employment and inflation.  This time they  say they are not sure if it is going to be time to revise their forecasts  down in March.</p><p>So they are in wait-and-see mode, but it looks like they could be in a  pause mode, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that what you heard, David?</p><p>DAVID JOY, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL:  Yes, it is.  Jon mentioned an interesting  word, confidence.  Confidence is very important to the fed.  They don't  want to back track on their position from just a few weeks ago.  But they  did leave himself an option to basically go on pause and get closer to  where the market is.  The market has not been on the same page.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I realize not everybody predicted the macro story in  2015.  But how did the fed miss this?  There were a fair amount of people  saying we could go into recession in 2016.</p><p>Things are slowing down.  Oil prices and there are always knock on effects  of oil.  How is it possible that all of a sudden now they are saying that  the economy slowed down?  I mean, you think?</p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL STRATEGIST:  I mean, we  did have signs at the end of last year.  I think in defense of the fed I'm  going to say they didn't totally messed this up because they acted on the  notion that the economy has improved so much because we have this  cumulative body of evidence that it's time to raise rates.</p><p>But they've always said they are going to be data dependent.  We've always  said is until there is going to be more economic momentum we are not going  to see a whole lot more rate increases out of the fed.  We are not seeing  that momentum right now.</p><p>ANDY BUSH, ENGAGE COMMUNICATIONS:  This is a central bank that missed their  opportunity to raise interest rates and raise them up to 1 percent or 1.5  percent.  I mean, they are two years behind the curve on this.  They were  so scared to do anything for so long they've allowed this to elongate and  now they are in a really difficult position.</p><p>JOY:  The fed is looking at the economy and we have a tendency to look at  the market.  One influences the other.  If you think about what the fed's  responsibility is, the U.S. economy is actually doing OK.</p><p>Certainly we are impacted by the weakness overseas and in oil.  The labor  markets had been quite strong going into year-end.  Not so much on  inflation front, but otherwise if you think about what their responsibility  is, I think they were justified in doing what they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I want to make two points.  One relates to your question,  Maria, how did the fed miss this?  I will tie you what they missed and what  a lot of people miss and that is China.</p><p>You know, when I've talked to fed officials over the years about the booms  in China, the real estate boom in industrial capacity boom.</p><p>They had this sense that Chinese officials were very effective at managing  that economy, almost more effective than anyone else in the world.</p><p>That their growth was that they had magically engineered this 10 percent  growth that would go on for a long time.  I think they overestimated the  ability of the Chinese to manage the economy and for the economy to sustain  itself.  That was a big miss, but it wasn't just them.  It was everybody.</p><p>This other point that the fed missed an opportunity to raise rates,  frankly, I just don't get that.  You know, if the fed has raise rates up to  1 percent, where would we be right now?</p><p>The economy is barely growing and rates are under a half percent.  If they  move rates up to 1 percent, you know, would the housing market be coming  back at this point?</p><p>BUSH:  We've gone through four rounds of quantitative easing and every time  we're getting less bang for the buck.  So the fed knows it is not working  anymore.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Why did that mean that raise should be a full percentage point  higher than they are right now?  The economy can barely manage a half  percent?  Why would it be able to manage 1 percent?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUSH:  We are no longer in an emergency landing situation.  Now the fed is  in a position where they can't do anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you defending all the QE?  Jon, is that what you're  doing?  You're defending the QE?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I didn't say anything about QE.  I'm not defending anybody.   What I'm saying is I don't get the argument that rates should be a full  percentage point higher than they are now when the economy can barely grow  and inflation is below 2 percent.  I just don't get that.</p><p>BUSH:  Two years ago -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Inflation was so low they felt they had to do more.  If they  were raising rates two years ago, we could be in deflation right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying that the fed didn't miss anything?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The fed has missed a lot.  I don't see how if an economy can  barely grow right now with rates near zero, why would we be expecting it to  be doing so much better with rates at 1 percent.  It just doesn't add up to  me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  But I don't think that anyone is making that argument,  Jon.  No one is making that argument at all.</p><p>AMOROSO:  The fed has to be really, really cautious here and the reality is  that the momentum of the fourth quarter has definitely slowed.  So the fed  is cautious.  Maybe the markets need to be cautious, too.  So David, any  thoughts on the near-term or long term reaction of the markets to this?</p><p>JOY:  I think the market will probably like what the fed did yesterday to  the extent that it takes some pressure off the dollar.  The dollar has been  driving oil prices lower.  It's been driving currencies particularly in  emerging world lower and that's been deflationary.</p><p>So if what they said yesterday takes a little bit pressure off of that,  maybe we can find some stability in the markets.  If the markets don't  respond, however, the dollar doesn't respond in a sustainable way.</p><p>Then I'm afraid this market is on shaky ground and maybe the next move is  still lower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to tell clients then?  You want to just  being cash.</p><p>JOY:  Well, for the near-term, I think you want to be a little bit  cautious.  If you have cash, I'd be very slow to put it back to work.   Certainly some values are beginning to emerge.</p><p>But if you are a longer term investor and you have a well diversified  portfolio, stay the course.  I think the U.S. economy would be just fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you agree with that, Anastasia?  What are you telling  clients?</p><p>AMOROSO:  You know, I think it's definitely a more challenging environment.   Strategic allocation is the most important decision that you will ever  make.  But I do think there's opportunity to be more tactical now.</p><p>Certainly you want to select the companies with strength and there's  probably nothing wrong with maybe trading the ranges a little bit.  There's  nothing wrong with having a rally and taking some money off the table and  maybe sometime further down the road.</p><p>The point is you don't want to do this with 100 percent of your portfolio.   You want to do this with a smaller portion of your portfolio.  That is how  you add that also.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jon, real quick.  Are you expecting a move in March  or no?  Is that off the table at this point?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think we have to see what the numbers look  like.  I'll tell you what.  If the jobless rates keep coming down, we've  got a 4.7 percent handle on the jobless rate, then yes, I think they do  have to keep moving because they respond to slack in the economy and that  means there is less slack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are going to get so criticized if they move and raise  interest rates in March I think.  I don't know.  Probably get criticized  either way, right.  We will see.  Jon Hilsenrath, always a pleasure, thank  you, sir.  David Joy, good to see.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>The Wendy's restaurant chain will investigating reports of a possible  credit card breach at some of its locations.  Nicole Petallides on this  important story.  Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  Fast  food chain, Wendy's, say it's investigating claims of unusual cavity at  some of its restaurants.</p><p>The Ohio-based company said it began receiving reports earlier this month  indicating fraudulent charges that they may have occurred on credit cards  after being used at some Wendy's locations.</p><p>The fast food restaurant has hired a cyber-security firm to perform the  investigation and they are encouraging customers to watch out for any  unauthorized charges.  Wendy's has not yet disclosed which restaurants are  affected by the data breach.</p><p>They have over 6,500 restaurants worldwide.  And overall, when you look up  malware, more than 25 percent of malware, Maria, was actually created last  year.</p><p>So obviously it's very prevalent and they are obviously working with the  authorities to break this down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you.  You don't know where a breach is going to  happen next.  Nicole, thank you.  Nicole Petallides.  Don't forget to start  your day every day with Nicole and Lauren Simonetti on \"FBN AM.\"  Catch it  right on the Fox Business Network right before MORNINGS WITH MARIA at 5:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Coming up next, shares of Facebook set to soar at the opening of trading  after the social media giant posted a profit of more than a billion dollars  in a three-month period.  Jo Ling Kent breaking down the numbers next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The armed occupation of a wildlife refuge in  Eastern Oregon may be unravelling.  Cheryl Casone with the story and other  headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  That is right, Maria.  Just hours after Ammon  Bundy, the leader of the group, told his followers to give up and go home.   Police said that they had arrested three more protesters.</p><p>After an appearance in federal district court in Portland, Ammon Bundy  issued a statement through his lawyer and told his followers to stand down.</p><p>At least five people have tested positive for the Zika virus here in New  York.  Health officials say New York City has two cases.  Federal officials  are advising pregnant women to reconsider travel to Brazil and 21 other  countries and territories that have Zika outbreaks.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yes, that is Mike Huckabee's latest ad showing the  presidential candidate on the campaign trail out in Iowa.  The former  Arkansas governor posting a parity of Adele's Smash single, \"Hello.\"</p><p>It's aimed at Iowa caucus goers, but the lyrics also take a few swipes at  Democratic contenders and Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  The parity became the  fastest video to reach a billion views on YouTube.  Not kidding.  A good  effort by Mike Huckabee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did anybody see the SNL skit about this?  Thank you, Cheryl.   Tune in later in the program when I sit down with Republican presidential  candidate, Mike Huckabee.  We'll ask him about the ad for sure.  He's  coming on the program at 8:30 a.m. Eastern today.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook surging this morning, just one of the many technology  companies reporting earnings this week.  We will talk with Chegg CEO, Dan  Rosensweig.  He is here in the studio.  We'll talk what is going on with  him.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook shares surging in the pre-market this  morning.  Big quarter, more than a billion dollars in earning.  Jo Ling  Kent with all the numbers.  Jo, good morning.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS:  Good morning, Maria.  Facebook just crushed it  beating Wall Street estimates in the fourth quarter.  Revenue came in at  $5.84 billion, up more than $50 percent.  Earnings per share of 79 cents.</p><p>Basically there are 1.59 billion people using Facebook every single month.   WhatsApp clocking in nearly a billion people there.  Mobile advertising was  where the money was.</p><p>It's soared to $4.5 million making up 80 percent of all ad revenue.   Facebook is also giving YouTube a run for its money.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg  said users are watching 100 million hours of video daily on Facebook.</p><p>The feature will be expensive, though.  Facebook executives say they plan  to spend a lot more on virtual reality, data centers, and doubling its  investments in Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Facebook shares soaring as you mentioned earlier.  After hours trading  spiking more than 12 percent.</p><p>And Alibaba also getting a lift this morning almost 3.5 percent higher in  the pre-market as earnings drop at 7:00 Eastern.  We are expecting EPS of  87 cents a share and revenue coming in at $5.03 billion, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jo, thanks so much.  Big story there and that's  going to be the name to watch.</p><p>Other big names in the tech sector reporting earnings later today.  Alibaba  as well as Amazon and Microsoft after the close.</p><p>We will talk more about what's going on online right now with the CEO of  Chegg, Dan Rosensweig with us in the studio.  Dan, good to see you.  Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>So when you look at what is going on, on Facebook right now, tell us what  that tells us about the entire online universe because you're running  Chegg.  Will you explain to viewers exactly what Chegg does?  You are also  former COO of Yahoo!</p><p>DAN ROSENSWEIG, CHEGG CEO:  Yes, and I had a good fortune to meet Mark when  he was 20 years old and to introduce Sheryl to Mark many, many years ago.   Obviously I'm a big fan and as you know we tried to buy them at Yahoo for a  billion dollars and now they do a billion dollars in earnings per quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would've been nice.</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  I'm beginning to think Mark is on to something.  Look, the  overall message is scale wins.  The internet is all about scale.  So  whether it's in commerce, Amazon, advertising, performance advertising.</p><p>Facebook is just first five, biggest five.  If you're going to market  online, you're going to start with your buy on Facebook.  You're going to  keep buying there because their reach is so big.</p><p>There are multiple platforms there's no big.  Their knowledge of the  customer so strong that you can just keep buying and then everybody else  becomes the second buy.</p><p>So the gap between them and everybody else is getting bigger and will only  get bigger.  It reminds of sort of when Google really started to come up or  even when I was at Yahoo! in 2002, 2003, the big guys begin to separate  themselves from the pack and you're beginning to see it.</p><p>So nobody, you know, we call it mobile advertising, it's just advertising  for Facebook.  They are on the phone.  That's where everybody uses it.  So  of course, it's mobile advertising.</p><p>So you know, the marketer doesn't say I want to buy Facebook for mobile.   They say I want to reach my audience.  Facebook knows more about them than  anybody.  I'm just going to keep buying on Facebook until I can't buy  anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is the point that Andy made earlier.  The fact that  they've got these measurement tools that is how the client this is how many  people are using Facebook right now and this is what they did after they  saw your ad.</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  We spent a lot of money online marketing and our first two  buyers are always going to be Facebook and Google until somebody  (inaudible) differently.</p><p>AMOROSO:  So Dan, are you saying the gap between Facebook and everybody  else is just so great that no one will chip away at them.</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  Well, what I've learned in the tech sector is you can't say no  one is going ever be able to -- because technology changes so much, the  understanding of data, ad networks, how to match things.</p><p>But it reminds me of when Google began its surge that unless somebody can  dethrone them why would you try to market anywhere else?  They have an  extraordinary management team.  They have an extraordinary sales team.</p><p>They are hitting on all cylinders.  I think the numbers reflect that.  You  know, they get a billion dollars in profits in a quarter and Yahoo's at 952  million for the year.</p><p>That is down from when I left from the billion five.  One is going one way,  one is going the other way.  It tells the whole story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it does and that is why the constant question out there.   It makes such sense to me that why would students buy these big heavy  textbooks when they can just rent them.</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  Well, you know, I think the evidence is showing they don't  want to buy them.  I have a 22-year-old who just graduated.  She works at  Buzzfeed and my 20-year-old is still in college.  Even if you can afford  them, why would you?  So why would you pay $300 for something you could  rent for 40 or 37?</p><p>BUSH:  I just went through this process.  Starting two years ago it is like  forget buying it.  Why would you want to buy it?  So renting is absolutely  the way go, but there is some pretty big margins in the rental space,  right?</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  We are getting big margins in the rental space, but we always  knew when I joined the company a little less than six years ago we had a  four-day-a-year relationship, rent return, rent return, good business for  transaction business, but not a big platform.</p><p>So in the last five years, we change this so now we help students match the  colleges.  Colleges pay us to recruit them because we know more about them  than anybody.  Much like Facebook.</p><p>But then we get them the required materials for cheaper online or offline.   We help them with their homework help.  We have the largest online tutoring  market place, largest internship database.  So all that out comes in return  on investment or trying to help to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also have data on free scholarships.  In this world of such  student debt, how do you see it?</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  Look, the largest search for high school student online before  they go to college is scholarships.  So that tell you everything, $1.3  trillion in debt.  You can't refinance government loans, which is crazy.</p><p>Sixty percent of our customers have loans.  They graduate with $28,000 on  average in loans.  The economy isn't great.  They are not getting paid a  lot of money.</p><p>We are literally forcing the future generations of this country to pay off  the debts of their parents and grandparents.  It is unfair.  It's  unnecessary, by the way, and if it was a free-market economy they could  actually refinance for much less.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really important insight.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ROSENSWEIG:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Rosensweig, Chegg.  We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Futures pointing to modest gains at the opening of trading.</p><p>Take a look, we've been back and forth between positive and negative territories this morning, we are expecting a higher opening for the Dow about 40 points high.</p><p>Nasdaq looking good, up 33 points, of course the Federal Reserve yesterday raised questions about the next time it will be able to raise interest rates.</p><p>Same with the economy did in fact slowdown at the end of last year. In Europe, markets are lower this morning across the board.</p><p>Take a look, down between two-thirds of 1 percent and one and a third percent. The Dax index in Germany down.</p><p>Hundred and thirty five points right now, that's the low of the morning, down better than 1 percent. And in Asia overnight, tough night in China.</p><p>The Shanghai composite down nearly 3 percent on the session, that set the tone. The Nikkei average down three-quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>Facebook, the stock to watch today. The social media giant handily beating earnings expectations.</p><p>Revenue soared better than 50 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, driven by mobile advertising.</p><p>The stock jumping in the pre-market this morning, Facebook up sharply right now. Growing concern this morning about the Zika virus.</p><p>The United Nations is holding an emergency meeting on Monday to determine whether the virus should be deemed an international health emergency.</p><p>This as new cases of the Zika virus confirmed in the United States just this morning. There are now at least six cases including New York.</p><p>Republican presidential candidates getting ready to face off tonight in the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>debate in Iowa.</p><p>The last GOP debate before Monday's Iowa caucuses. Blake Burman is in Des Moines right now with the preview of what to expect tonight. Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Hi there, Maria, good morning to you. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>continues to maintain steadfastly that he will not be here at the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>debate tonight, later tonight here in Des Moines.</p><p>This is still an incredibly important debate for so many different reasons. Not only is it the final debate in the lead up until the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.</p><p>But also the first debate here in Iowa as well, over the issues for Iowa voters will be front and center.</p><p>There will be 11 other candidates here guaranteed later tonight. The 9:00 debate has seven candidates on that stage.</p><p>Cruz and Rubio will be front and center, they'll be flanked by Carson and Bush, Christie and Kasich, and Rand Paul makes his return to the 9:00 debate stage.</p><p>But this all kicks off at 7:00 with four candidates: Fiorina, Huckabee and Santorum. Jim Gilmore also returns to this debate.</p><p>I was speaking with an adviser yesterday of Ted Cruz, and that adviser told me that his campaign feels that Cruz will be the one receiving the cross- fire now.</p><p>Because if Trump isn't there, they say, you know what? People shoot up in these debates, Cruz is running second in the polls, they expect their guy to get a lot of the heat tonight.</p><p>Still, they told me, Maria, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will not going to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: But at the end of the day, it's not really the Donald who is afraid of Megyn.</p><p>It's not that he's afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush. It's not that he's afraid of me. He's afraid of you.</p><p>He doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesn't match what he's selling.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Things still look good for Trump here. A new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll out this morning shows he has 32 percent support from Iowa caucus, though rose at 7 points ahead of Cruz, Rubio comes in at 18 as well.</p><p>That poll also shows in the other early states of New Hampshire and South Carolina that Trump lead big. Maria, back to to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thanks so much Blake Burman. And joining us right now is former Senate Majority leader George Mitchell and former RNC chairman and former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.</p><p>Good to see you both gentlemen, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEORGE MITCHELL, FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, let me kick this off with you. What's your take on what's going on right now?</p><p>Is Trump not showing up tonight, is that going to be good for him or do you think he loses in this?</p><p>MITCHELL: I think it's probably not good for him, the more important question is, will it derail his efforts in it, I doubt that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it won't be good for him, but it won't derail him either?</p><p>MITCHELL: No, I don't think it would. Ted Cruz himself said, I think it was yesterday that, if Trump wins Iowa and then goes on to win New Hampshire which proves likely, he'll be unstoppable.</p><p>And on that I think Senator Cruz may be right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, governor, what do you think?</p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FORMER MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR: Well, obviously, Trump thinks it's good for him or he wouldn't be doing it.</p><p>This is -- I don't think this is about his feelings being hurt. I think he made the calculation he's got more to lose by being in the debate than not being in the debate.</p><p>But we'll see. He's -- if the polling is to be believed, he's got a solid lead in both of these states.</p><p>I don't think anybody has got it in the bag. I don't think the idea that somebody is inevitable if they win both these debates is accurate, but I guess, he gets a mighty powerful momentum --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BARBOUR: If he wins both of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think this is a really good point. But let me ask you about what he said about you governor, because he was asked about you with George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>And he said, look, Haley Barbour, he's an old-time politician, he's been up in my office looking for money many times, Trump says.</p><p>He's an old-time politician who is losing his grip. Frankly, I haven't heard the name Haley Barbour ever mentioned in a year and a half, and the reason that me and Ted Cruz are in the lead is because of that.</p><p>What do you think about this governor?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, he's certainly right that I'm old. But the fact is, George Stephanopoulos, the next day apologized for telling <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>that I had said something about him that I didn't say.</p><p>In fact, I hadn't said anything about him. I've only met the guy twice in my life and one time he took me to a heavyweight championship fight in Atlantic City when I was RNC chairman back in the -- back in the '90s.</p><p>I've stayed out of this just like I did in 2008 and 2012 as a former national party chairman.</p><p>That's what I have intended to do and I've done it again. I'm going to support the nominee of the party, because I don't think our country can stay four more years with Obama's policies.</p><p>And that's what we'll get if we elect Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. But that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>I'm going to follow Reagan's 11th commandment, I was a political director to (INAUDIBLE) and Ronald Reagan, that's what he preached and practiced.</p><p>And that's what I start to practice --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. Stephanopoulos apologized because basically he was starting this thing between the two of you, and you didn't even say anything.</p><p>It was actually --</p><p>BARBOUR: That is right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Henry Barbour, the former -- your nephew and --</p><p>BARBOUR: That's exactly right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A Republican strategist, so he said it, he brings up your name as if you said it, and Trump lashes at you for no reason.</p><p>But Senator Mitchell --</p><p>BARBOUR: OK --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The idea that Bernie Sanders is in the lead in Iowa on the Dem side and Trump is in the lead on the Republican side.</p><p>What does it say about our country right now?</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, I think there's a lot of frustration, anger, that happens whenever the economy turns down.</p><p>The President who campaigns provide an outlet for frustration that people feel. Particularly those who aren't moving up in the new economy.</p><p>We figured out a way to encourage innovation, we have the technological revolutions which we're now passing.</p><p>We'll be seeing in the future as important in human affairs as it was the industrial revolution.</p><p>But we haven't figured out how to replace the jobs that had been lost. What I call the working man middle income jobs.</p><p>Factory worker who could support a wife and two children. And that frustration will continue for a long time and it's finding its expression now in the presidential campaign on both sides.</p><p>But I think you're going to see a closely contested election in the general election. The country is pretty much divided.</p><p>The parties, well, I think generally unite, you heard Hillary say he'll support whoever the nominee is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>MITCHELL: And an interesting way, Trump is the nominee will help the Democrats unite and Secretary Clinton as the Democratic nominee will help the Republicans unite.</p><p>So, although, history isn't much of a guide in this election, history tells us that you can have a hotly contested nominee processes and still find the parties coming together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you surprised Bernie Sanders is beating Hillary in Iowa?</p><p>MITCHELL: No, I think that he's beating Hillary in the polls, and as you see from the poll results, it's overwhelmingly among young people.</p><p>The question still is whether they will turn out to vote. But I think once you get past New Hampshire, he isn't in his favorable territory as he is in these first two states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor, what about you? You know, you've been the chairman of the RNC, what do you think in terms of how this plays out next several months?</p><p>How important is Iowa followed by New Hampshire? What are the other states that you think will really give us a sense of who in fact people are voting for?</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, when you go down to the south, you'll see if you get different results, but I'm not sure that you will.</p><p>But I think George Mitchell makes very important points. The country is very evenly divided.</p><p>But there's so much polarity. There's so much division and it is because as he said, people in our country are dissatisfied.</p><p>And it's not the right or the left, it's both. You see it in both parties, and it's because nearly two-thirds of Americans think that the country is going in the wrong direction.</p><p>And that you thought that for two or three years. This is not some phenomenon because something bad happened last week or last month or last quarter.</p><p>People have been very dissatisfied about the economy, about national security, about so many things that it's manifesting now that people say, you know, that they're mad at everybody in Washington.</p><p>Hence Bernie Sanders, hence <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Ted Cruz, both parties though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, who do you think has the best plan to fix some of these things then? I mean, you know, Senator Mitchell is talking about automation, technology displacing people.</p><p>Obviously wages haven't moved. There are a lot of issues that are upsetting people.</p><p>BARBOUR: And very rarely is that talked about in the news coverage. Mostly, it's about personality, it's about polling, it's about tactics.</p><p>We need more of the debate to be about. Here is the problem, here is my plan to fix the problem, and frankly, the candidates that talked the most about that, Kasich and Bush and Christie on our side, they get the least coverage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right --</p><p>BARBOUR: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>gets ten times more coverage than everybody else combined without ever really talking about anything and any detail.</p><p>And I'm not criticizing, that's just the fact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BARBOUR: Public use very little about the issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but to be fair, I mean, in our debates that we've done here at the Fox Business Network, we stuck to the issues, we got a chance to really talk about tax reform.</p><p>Did you hear anything that you feel would resonate with people, senator?</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, it's very difficult in the current campaign mode, particularly these debates.</p><p>No criticism of anybody when you got a dozen people up on the stage and you got 30 or 60 seconds to answer a question.</p><p>It's conducive to bumper stickers, slogans and superficial statements --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true --</p><p>BARBOUR: If you get up and make a reasonable statement, you'll never get on the television news or get in the newspapers.</p><p>Could I just add one point then, not to disagree with Haley, the feeling of dissatisfaction goes back a lot longer than two or three years.</p><p>You'll recall in 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had a very difficult economic circumstance.</p><p>We were losing 400,000 jobs a month at the -- at the bottom of the recession in which we dropped and there was enormous dissatisfaction then.</p><p>Since then, it's come back some in the President's term, 15 million new jobs have been created.</p><p>We have the strongest economy in the world by far, how it's relative and turning to -- and Russia have far more serious problems than we do.</p><p>But we still have serious issues that we have not been able to overcome, that will take a unified effort.</p><p>And one of the long term disadvantages of these polarizing campaigns is that it's hard to get people working together again after the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BARBOUR: When we really need to pull together to try to solve some of the long range issues that are not attributable to one party or the other, to one president or another.</p><p>But really are attributable to underlying economic, social and cultural forces that are affecting not just the people of this country, but people all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess governor, as you said, people are frustrated that we're not farther along.</p><p>I mean, you're right, the financial crisis in 2008 is where this feelings started.</p><p>But they're looking in the last 7 years and saying, my wages haven't moved, my situation hasn't changed much.</p><p>BARBOUR: Well, the recovery has been the weakest since World War II about 2.2 percent a year economic growth which is about half as much growth per year as after the last deep recession in the '80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>BARBOUR: Median household income is actually less than it was eight years ago. Those kinds of things, people notice. You know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>BARBOUR: A lot of people will say they can't tell the difference between the recession and the recovery.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BARBOUR: And so people are down, and we need everybody to work together. George Mitchell is right about that as he's right about very many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor, thank you, senator, good to see you.</p><p>MITCHELL: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Appreciate it very much, we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A mystery illness forcing American airlines flights to making emergency landing.</p><p>Breaking news now with Cheryl Casone. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: I tell you what, Maria, still no answers on this.</p><p>A Los Angeles-bound American Airlines flight forced to return to London's Heathrow after several people including a flight attendant fell ill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a lot of commotion and they immediately threw the lights on, and then maybe five minutes later, they announced that 7 of the 13 flight attendants on board had either passed out or were too sick to fulfill their duties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: So, yes, one flight attendant passed out. Officials say that paramedics examined and they discharged six people who complained of feeling light-headed.</p><p>That plane had 188 people on board. They did check the air, no results yet. And check this out.</p><p>Calgary Flames defenseman Dennis Wideman checking the referee Don Henderson in what appears to be an intentional hit.</p><p>This is big. It happened after Wideman took a hit against the boards from one of the Nashville Predators.</p><p>Wideman does face possible suspension over the video that you're seeing right there.</p><p>And finally, you may want to check your credit card statement if you've eaten at Wendy's recently.</p><p>The fast-food chain launching an investigation in what it is calling unusual activity related to customers cars. Maria.</p><p>Really quick here. The banks are the ones that flagged Wendy's that they had an issue, so there's one for the banks for you, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. An earnings blowout from Facebook. Meanwhile, that has the stock of the social networking giant surging this morning more than 13 percent in the pre-market.</p><p>How a rallying today's session could push the company to see its biggest gain in nearly two years. Back in a minute with more Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's all about technology on the upside. Two tech heavyweights surging in the pre-market after posting strong quarterly results.</p><p>Jo Ling Kent with all the numbers and the details. Jo.</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS: It's a good day if you own Facebook or Alibaba, what a morning for both of those companies.</p><p>Alibaba reporting blockbuster earnings, showing that for now their consumers continue to consume a lot in China.</p><p>They posted revenue of $5.33 billion, beating expectations for $5.03 billion. EPS also a beat at 99 cents versus 87 cents.</p><p>Alibaba says it now has 407 million annual active buyers, that's more than the population of the United States, and mobile revenue is up 192 percent year-over-year to $101 billion.</p><p>Global merchandize volume also up 23 percent year-over-year to 149 billion. And Alibaba surging on this news in the pre-market, up about 4 percent right now in the pre-market.</p><p>Another big story this morning. Facebook trading up 12 percent ahead of the bell after earnings beat on revenue and everywhere actually.</p><p>Facebook says it earned $3.73 a share for everyone of its 1.59 billion monthly active users.</p><p>And I thought this -- that was really interesting. A 100 million hours of video are watched on Facebook every single day.</p><p>And Mark Zuckerberg planning to spend big on Instagram, later being for internet access and other big ventures.</p><p>So, we can see the spending rate continue to go up for Facebook, but they've been able to match it with revenue and its mobile ad revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Its mobile ad revenue, and you know, interestingly, earlier, we were talking about this, and someone said, look, it's not just about mobile.</p><p>Advertisers say, I want to be reaching clients, and the bottom-line is --</p><p>LING KENT: Target --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's where the target declines are.</p><p>LING KENT: It really is one of the only places on social media where you can reach a very large audiences, very targeted and actually get something out of it.</p><p>And the metric that Sheryl Sandberg(ph) mentioned on the call last night, she basically said they can do it with politics and small businesses and big brands.</p><p>No one else is able to do that right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen McDowell back on set. Some pretty big wins for these companies.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: And this is -- this is really good news for the markets that you can have a company that really delivers, that looks good.</p><p>Anastasia was pointing to the fact that it has a very large concentration of business in the United States, which is positive.</p><p>And have a stock that it raises about a 10 percent loss so far this year, potentially in one day.</p><p>They've got a lot of upside video here, only about 20 percent so far. They've got is really monetize --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That, Whatsapp, also, the Atlas Rift headset, that virtual reality headset is coming out which I'm pretty stoked about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, me too --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I was just going to say, you know, and this is an election-year, too.</p><p>So, you know ad spending from that side is going to shoot way up and Facebook obviously is the key component.</p><p>LING KENT: They talked about that --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right --</p><p>LING KENT: Last night actually, and Sheryl Sanberg(ph) said it's going very well, politically.</p><p>But what they see is not just the presidential candidates revenue coming in, it's local politicians that are really using --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right --</p><p>LING KENT: To their --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes --</p><p>LING KENT: Advantage --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because of the targeted nature --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sorry, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to comment on the Alibaba. To me, that's the other encouraging story so far this morning.</p><p>Because we all know that China has been in this transition from the -- you know, the investment-driven economy to the consumption-driven economy.</p><p>It seems like at least the consumer is actually holding up in China when the investment piece we know certainly not.</p><p>LING KENT: Yes, it seems like the psychology hasn't really affected consumption, and especially when people on Alibaba are spending very small amounts, and then some people spend more.</p><p>But they continue to get people on-boarding on mobile first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it might be an indication that the shift from the capital intensive, you know, infrastructure to the consumer-led.</p><p>This is actually starting to work pretty well. And these are the type of companies that you want to be invested in, in China.</p><p>LING KENT: We'll see. I'm always skeptical of Alibaba and the structure of the company and the regulations and kind of fit issues. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right --</p><p>LING KENT: And that, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's a number of people were when they first went public. Jo, thanks.</p><p>LING KENT: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up next, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee will join me next to discuss his game plan for tonight's GOP debate.</p><p>Before we take a break, take a look at this. DeLorean is going back to the future and into production.</p><p>The DeLorean Motor Company is in Texas, will begin making cars after a 34- year break.</p><p>Under a new manufacturing bill, they'll build 300 replica 1982 models like that famous car in back to the future.</p><p>They start rolling off the assembly line next year, a $100,000 per vehicle, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news, durable goods down 5.1 percent. The number is just out a moment ago. This is not as bad as some were expecting, still looking at a decline down 5.1 percent on durable goods orders, however, not as bad as the expectations called for. It -- it -- Anastasia, how do you see this number?</p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: It certainly -- the durable goods order continues to be a disappointing number. I mean, all of this is a function of three forces that are playing in the markets right now, which is low oil, high dollar.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, I got to -- I got to correct myself. It's down 5.1 percent. I thought it was five tenth. Down 5.1 percent is much worse than expected, 5.1 percent.</p><p>AMOROSO: That is an incredibly bad number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Down 5.1 percent. Wow.</p><p>ANDY BUSCH, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: What's ex -- what's external lines (ph), that's .</p><p>AMOROSO: It -- it certainly -- if that's the number, that's certainly a huge disappointment. And again, we have energy deploying for it, we probably have China to blame for it. It would be a huge mess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is, 5.1 percent.</p><p>BUSCH: Yeah. I think it means the fourth quarter has been --it's going to be horrendous. I mean, we already have from the Atlanta GDP now number, looking at -- at plus point 7. I think we may take that down a notch or two for -- for what GDP will be in this. Place in that team (ph) but things are bad, things are slowing down, earnings aren't there, so this is all part of that. I don't want to read too much in a volatile number, but we know that, you know, these are things that factor into how you look at whether you should be invested, how much you should be invested or not. It's just slowing earnings, slowing GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I believe for a while, durable goods were down for 11 straight months. I don't think we've seen an increase. I think we're continuing on this trend of down sharply, for .</p><p>AMOROSO: Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: . now almost a year.</p><p>AMOROSO: We absolutely are, and you also see that in the PMI manufacturing surveys. For example, whether you look at the new orders component, whether you .</p><p>BUSCH: Right.</p><p>AMOROSO: . look at the employment component, all of them have been declining. But this miss is a huge miss. And this really, I guess shows how much belt tightening that companies have been .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>. doing in the fourth quarter to navigate this very challenging environment.</p><p>BUSCH: Well, it's interesting because jobless claims are 278, because that's the ying and the yang here, right. So, we got obviously -- on the one side, manufacturing, durable goods that looks really soft. And on the other side, employment is holding up really well and jobless claims I think is -- is a really good, real time number field for how the employment situation is in the United States, instead of the monthly non-comparable (ph) numbers.</p><p>So, I'd like to look at that one, especially the four-week average, and it's holding up really well. I think that's why most economist are saying, it's hard to see like a dramatic drop off in the U.S. economy or a recession in 2016 with those types of numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO: This is -- this is exactly why the fed had to do what they did yesterday. They have to stop and reassess the balance of risk. Because clearly, as we see today, as we've seen too Maria your point for the last year, risks are building for the manufacturing sector. Will they spill over into the service sector? So there's two key things that we will be watching in the service sector. First is the service employment. We will get that in the PMI surveys once again, even before we get into the job numbers. The second thing is consumer credit. That's why the question was asked here earlier in the show, is, once you seek consumer credit rolling over that could be a pretty strong indicator. We're not seeing that yet in the four-week ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUSCH: Yeah, because of.</p><p>AMOROSO: . average basis.</p><p>BUSCH: . the jobs are holding up, right?</p><p>AMOROSO: For now, yeah, for now, but .</p><p>BUSCH: Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you believe that though? I mean, that's the thing, I mean, the jobs are holding up. You -- you see more job improvement, but, you know, when you look at things like durable goods down 5.1 percent, much worse than expected. You look at what's happening in the commodities complex.</p><p>AMOROSO: Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The -- the collapse that we've seen. That's showing you a completely different economy than the job improvements.</p><p>AMOROSO: It is. You know, for now, it's all about the service jobs, because that's the biggest chunk of the economy. But I will say Maria that as the stock market is down 6 or 7 percent, and as investors have not really seen stellar returns for even the prior year. As investors look at their household net worth, it's not necessarily declining, because housing prices are still going up. But it certainly not increasing at the pace that it was increasing at before. So, that could potentially dent the confidence and perhaps further slowdown the momentum that we've already seen .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>AMOROSO: . slowdown in the fourth.</p><p>BUSCH: Well, and a lot of consumers too, and this could be happening as well. They've never experienced like having money and a job in -- in its (ph) normal recession. They've only experienced the great recession, right. And so they think that when the economy slows, holy cow, the world is going to fall apart. It's not necessarily going to happen, but it will feel like because that's your only frame of reference. So, I think it's a great point to watch consumer spending for sure, of course, but let's see if that psychology continues to play through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point that there are stages set, of course, for the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Republican presidential debate, meanwhile. Candidates are hoping to make a lasting impression on Iowa voters before they cast their votes on Monday. Joining us right now is Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee, Governor, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, Maria, great to be here. It's cold out here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, it's cold in Iowa, we know. We're just getting the numbers for durable goods order and its cold there as well, by the way. Because you got an economy that continues to shows signs of deteriorating. Are you hearing these concerns from Iowa voters right now, governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Absolutely, Maria. You know, when I heard the president in his state of the union trying to talk about how great the economy is doing, he's just missing it. He needs to get out more. And if he would come here in Iowa, he would talk to single moms like the one I spoke to the other night in Indianola. They'll talk about how difficult it is for her, how she's trying to go to work, but if she does, she loses all the benefits, her kids basically ends up in dire poverty. Are the man who makes $59 thousand a year in Davenport, Iowa. He told me that on $59 thousand a year, he and his wife, that's all on their insurance. Obamacare this year it's going to cost them $28 thousand, that's half their income. These are the stories of real Americans</p><p>BARTIROMO: I Agree.</p><p>HUCKABEE: These are the people that have lost their jobs.</p><p>BUSCH: And governor, Andy Busch here, I think what's interesting on the Republican side, and your certainly part of this, I haven't seen this in a very, very long time. Where the Republican candidate have put out detailed tax plan, and I think yours it's very interesting, because it's a national sales tax. But you eliminate the income tax and you also have full expensing but contained -- walk us through why that is important for Iowa.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it's important for all of America. Because right now we tax capital and labor, so everything we make in America has 22 percent embedded tax in it. But they're not taxing capital and labor in competing countries like Mexico, China, Indonesia. As a result of that, we're getting hammered. People are losing manufacturing job, 5 million since the year 2000. Trillions of dollars of money is parked offshore. That would be in our economy but it isn't, because people are protecting it from the income tax. So if we stop punishing, which means taxing the productivity of workers, if we stop taxing the investment of investors, then we have work and investment coming back. We're losing both. And that's why the fair tax is a superior alternative to taxing people productivity, their income, their investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think you will be able to get tax reform through when we have been talking about this for so many years, and it's so impossible to get done?</p><p>HUCKABEE: You have to have leadership to do it. It's never going to get done without a president who can explain it, who can articulate it, and who can make Americans understand how this helps them. And that's one of the reasons that I am in this race. Because I don't think most of the tax plans -- I hear some of these guys and all they're doing is tap in the hammer, twisting the screwdriver. It's tinkering with the tax code. But the power of the tax code is the power to shake down the donors, so that they can get contributions to the political campaigns. They get tax breaks to the people who give them donors. And look, the people who are taking the gut punches are the folks out here in Middle America, who don't make millions of dollars a year. They're hoping to hold on to a $45-$50 thousand a year income, if that. They're the ones are whom tax reform makes a world of difference and puts them back in the game of being in the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you prepare for tonight, governor? How do you think tonight will be different given the fact that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will not be on the stage, and what are you doing to sort of breakout?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, you know, I got to just answer the questions honestly. I hope we have sensitive questions we have in the last few debates, and I think that's been very helpful. Quite frankly, I'm not just now kissing up to you guys, but the Fox Business debates, the two most substance debate that we have had in the entire cycle, and I say that sincerely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you very much, sir. We appreciate that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Because the questions are about issues. They're truly were. They're really genuinely worth. And that's what we need tonight. We need questions that focus on the people of America, and what we would do as president to help their lives get back on track so that we can hand this country to our kids and grandkids in better shape that we are finding it right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you think it's going to be a real, sort of, different, a stark difference with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>not on stage?</p><p>HUCABEE: You know, I don't know, I want to be on stage with him. I think, way too many people are talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>and they're not talking about these Americans out there, you know, who lost their jobs at the Newton, Iowa, Maytag plant when it shut down. And you know, it's not about <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>It's not about me. It's not about any of the other candidates. It really oath to be about how Americans are getting hammered out there every single day, and you watch people and you look at the -- just their faces and you see their sense of frustration, you see their anger. It's like they know that the people who are showing out the big bucks to the politician, they're fine, they're going to be great. They're not going to have to miss a vacation. They'll jet away to the Caribbean when it's cold. And they'll summer in the Hamptons and go to Maine. But these folks aren't even able to, you know, 50 miles from home and have a vacation. And they just want to know that somebody is going to be out there fighting for them. That's why I hope the debate can be about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would love to run a little bit of your ad, governor. The Adele song, do we have that? Here it comes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, governor, what were you thinking with this?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it was my inner Adele. I think sometimes we have to Back up and have some fun with this stuff. And one of the things we wanted to do is to show that as we travel out there around Iowa, on the frozen tundra, of snow covered cornfields, you know, there are people in all these cities, and we try to bring a little culture of Iowa, do it in a fun way. Interesting is the reaction has gone to some people said, that's the funniest thing we've seen this cycle, others say that's the dumbest, most cringed worthy, corniest, nonsense we ever seen in our lives. So, the good news is, everybody is talking about it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We like her beautiful voice. Governor, good to see you, thanks so much you're a sport for explaining it, thanks very much.</p><p>HUCKABEE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIRMO: We'll see you soon. Good luck in Iowa, Mike Huckabee, joining us right there.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Take a short break. And we got more coverage of what is much worse than expected durable goods report, down 5.1 percent. More Mornings With Maria, straight ahead.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis. At 34, Serena Williams is already the oldest woman to win a major. But at this stage of her career, the world's number one is all about the history books and for tennis legacy.

And finally, Maria, and ladies, this is amazing. Barbie is getting a whole new body. The so-called the world's bestselling doll is actually getting three new bodies. They're going to have petite, tall, and my favorite is going to be curvy. Pastel and Mattel still plan to make the original fit of waist of Barbie, but in the age of Beyonce and Kim Kardashian, great message going out to kids everywhere, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Trying to be more realistic, I guess.</p><p>CASONE: Yeah, it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. I like that. Still to come, amazing numbers from China E-commerce Alibaba, stocks getting it boast from the pre-markets, and then there's Facebook. Plus, an incredible cloud formation over Portugal, captured in film. Take a look at this photo. Some saying it looks more like the hand of God holding a fireball than clouds.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Good morning, I'm Nicole Petallides, live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stock futures are looking to the upside, about 47 point on the Dow Jones Industrial average right now, S&amp;P futures up about 8. We're looking for some movers today, you have Deutsche Bank pulling back. Semis could lead the way, names like United Micro, Terradigm, Texas Instrument. Alibaba and Facebook, two names we know so well. Alibaba came out with sales expectations that wowed Wall Street, in fact, profit more than double, and also, saying their well position for China's Shift to consumption and services going forward. That stock is likely to be a big winner here up about 6 percent. Facebook shares also soaring in the pre-market, up more than 10 percent throughout this morning. Mobile moves, obviously that has been the big story there. And Mark Zuckerberg now moves to the sixth richest man in the world. More Mornings With Maria, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I am with Anastasia Amoroso, from JP Morgan, and Andy Busch this morning. Let's talk about the durable goods report you guys, much worse than expected, Anastasia, December durable goods missing expectations by a wide margin, down 5.1 percent.</p><p>AMOROSO: Yes, Maria. Frankly, when you first of that number, I couldn't believe it, because it's such a big miss. Digging through the numbers we have to take out the very volatile defense component, and the very volatile transportation component. So, for example defense orders were down about 34 percent. And non-defense aircraft orders were down about 30 percent. So, that's what driven a lot of those numbers. But, even when I take transportation out of the equation, you are still looking at durable goods being down, 1.2 percent, once again missing expectation. As Andy and I, was just talking about, not only that we miss these expectations, we also saw downward revisions to the November numbers. Look, it's undeniable that the state of the manufacturing sector in the United States and globally is in recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, and this tells you that businesses are holding back, on spending, their holding back on putting money into plants and equipment's, Andy.</p><p>BUSCH: Yeah. And I think, well, look at durable goods, the disappointing component of it is the fact that consumer spending is not holding up. You would have thought with the lower gas lean, you start be a dust, start to see a pick up there. But, I think, also, it underscores, you know, as far as growth goes, we need to do something fundamentally globally that to change the picture. It isn't quantitative easing anymore, it isn't monetary easing, this really has to get it. Economic reform in the United States, it's really tax reform. One thing I just want to point out, I mean, I wrote two articles going through Cruz, Rubio, and Trump, plans, but I just want to point out is that they have full expensing. What does that mean? It means companies can write off plants and equipment's in the year that they do it. That would generate huge economic growth in the United States. But don't believe me, you can go to a tax foundation and take a look at it. But, it is really important and I believe it will happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's an interesting point. Because this is exactly what this report speaks to. They're not spending money on plants and equipment. You're saying, if in fact we were to see tax reform, because up until now it has been all about the Fed. We know that, monetary policy. We need some fiscal policy. If we were to see tax they can get a break, tax wise on investing plants and equipment.</p><p>BUSCH: Well you can write off wages in the year that you have and expense for business. But, you can't do that with a plant. You have to re-shade it 10, 20, 30 years, it's ridiculous. It should be in the year that you make the payment, right? And that's what I think. Hold back to the United States, all of these, you know, these questions about offshoring and plants overseas, big tech, big pharma, you cut their tax rate, they will bring this money back. That's the international component tax reform. But the full expensing will really drive it higher, and I am excited about that. But we need to get going on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you analyze Cruz's plan, Rubio</p><p>BUSCH: Yes, Cruz, Trump, and Rubio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. I want to hear your thoughts next time on Carson's plan, because he's really getting really high marks on his tax plan. Anastasia, let me ask you this, we're already in recession when you look at the industrial side of the economy. Does this mean, that this durable goods number, does this make you feel like we could go into an out now recession in `16?</p><p>AMOROSO: I don't think so. I think the consumer can slow is the function of the stock markets. Then I'll tell you what I'm most worried about, real quick, it's China. You know, China is fighting a wild battle, whether it comes to the stock market, to their property market, credit market, the Yuan, and of course, the economy can't solve them all at once, the answer is probably not. So, Andy's point is exactly right, we need a new fiscal policy that would be a stimulus, because China was a huge global stimulus before. It's not anymore.</p><p>BARTIRMO: Yeah, and that's why you're saying exports down, you're seeing the manufacturing are down, it does have a lot to do with China.</p><p>AMOROSO: Yes it does.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then what do you think this rally all about? Up 85 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this is just happening in the last half an hour, do you think it's because people are saying, look, Federal Reserve never going to be able to raise rates in March.</p><p>AMOROSO: I think that is exactly right.

Despite what were sometimes cantankerous and politically charged exchanges between Republican and Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee, perhaps the most interesting line of the hearing came at the start, when Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, recounted a comment he attributed to Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.): \"This is the most bipartisan effort I've been involved with in 5 1/2 years in Congress.\"    What followed was a bipartisan roast of the heads of Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. -- four of the five most valuable companies in America. It was a pandemic-era spectacle of scrutiny that evoked past congressional grilling of the captains of other industries near the peaks of their powers, from tobacco and finance to energy and steel -- only this time, with the CEOs in virtual attendance via videoconference software.    A rare moment of united purpose from a body otherwise bitterly at odds over so many other issues, the hearing showed that the effort to regulate tech companies is becoming a big-tent issue, and possibly a place for compromise between conservatives worried largely about constraints on their speech, and liberals worried primarily about constraints on competition.    Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opened his comments with a broadside comparing large tech companies to the railroad-owning robber barons of old. He said that the four companies own the digital rails on which countless other firms depend, and that his committee would follow \"in this proud tradition\" of determining whether current antitrust law is up to the task of addressing the presumed harms of these companies.    Then the Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), declared, \"I'll just cut to the chase: Big Tech's out to get conservatives.\"    The common thread was the threat of outsize market power, and it wove its way through more than five hours of testimony even as the questions swung between the pet causes of the members.    While none of the CEOs -- who included two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg -- seemed to break much of a sweat, they clearly weren't comfortable either.    They parried a combination of specific, even wonkish questions about instances of allegedly anticompetitive behavior -- some based on internal documents that hadn't previously been made public -- and accusations of partisan bias in how they treat speech on their platforms.    The CEOs disputed the claims, argued that their products are helpful and well-liked, and occasionally promised to get more information. They remained polite, even when frequently cut off by interrogators trying to squeeze more questions into limited time.    Mr. Zuckerberg was asked repeatedly about Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram and the way its then-CEO perceived his approach as a threat to either sell or be destroyed. Mr. Zuckerberg pointed out that Facebook's acquisition and investment had led to success for Instagram that wasn't guaranteed when the deal was made.    Mr. Bezos was grilled about a Wall Street Journal article from April describing Amazon's use of data from its platform to compete against the independent sellers on the platform that it calls partners. He said Amazon values those merchants and that Amazon is still investigating the Journal's findings.    Alphabet's Sundar Pichai was probed on Google's dominance of the online ad marketplace, and asked about a specific accusation that Google had collaborated with the Chinese government in a way that potentially constituted treason. He strongly denied that accusation, and said he had cleared up the matter in a meeting with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    Apple's Tim Cook, who received the least attention of the group, was questioned several times about its control of its own app store and the impact on rival app developers and on consumers. He argued that Apple has consistently applied its rules across its app store, and has eliminated fees from some categories of apps and services.    There were also suggestions of potential interference in the 2016 election, both on and by platforms, and both for and against the election of President Trump, and questions about why the platforms should have the power to remove a video claiming hydroxychloroquine was a cure for Covid-19. (Short answer from Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai: They follow the guidelines of health authorities and remove anything that could lead to imminent harm; in June, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency-use approval of the drug.)    At times, it was as if separate hearings were occurring, with representatives, more or less divided along party lines, behaving like a boat full of oarsmen who can't decide in which direction to row.    But they kept circling back to the idea that without checks on the power of these companies, now collectively worth nearly $5 trillion, the tech giants could abuse it.    At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R.-Fla.) closed a statement in which he accused Google of being deceptive in saying that it doesn't manually tune its search results ( a Journal investigation has found that in some ways it does), by saying that the company could suppress or favor speech, and interfere in a U.S. election, through its \"market dominance.\"    There is no clear playbook for how to proceed -- even many of those who do believe that antitrust action is required against Big Tech say that the current laws and traditional notions of consumer harm aren't well-suited for companies whose popular products are often inexpensive or even free.    But the hearing's consistent hostility offers a signal of common purpose to the groups that are actively pursuing some sort of antitrust action against one or more of these companies: the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and an assortment of state attorneys general.    And, if past is prologue, that type of unified anger could be a prelude to action by Congress itself. In April 2009, after the financial crisis, seven bank CEOs were hauled in front of Congress, and in July 2010 it passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandated a litany of changes to Wall Street business practices and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.    All of this takes place against a backdrop of a global pandemic -- one that is only strengthening the power of Big Tech -- and a presidential campaign. Here too, the unusual concordance between members of both parties stands out.    One issue on which both Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and Mr. Trump agree is that something must be done to rein in Big Tech. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump tweeted, \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech...I will do it myself with Executive Orders.\" Mr. Biden has signaled similar aggressive intentions, saying at the start of his presidential campaign, in May 2019, that breaking up Big Tech companies like Facebook is \"something we should take a really hard look at.\"    If substantial action against some or all of these companies finally happens, this hearing may mark an unlikely watershed -- a moment of relative unity in an era of division that showed America's elected leaders are ready to rein in Big Tech.

Under Reaganism, the conservative intelligentsia came to view the market as supreme - often in opposition to its own voting base.</p><p>That is still the case. Today, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">50% of Republican voters</url> support Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax proposal, but not a single Republican in Congress does.</p><p>But there are signs that economic populism may be returning to the Republican party.</p><p>At a recent conservative conference in Washington DC, Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">told attendees</url> that an \"economy driven by money changing on Wall Street ultimately benefits those who have the money to start with, and that economy will not support a great nation\".</p><p>This is the sort of language you would typically associate with a Republican lawmaker in the pre-Reagan years, when it produced senators such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">Wisconsin's Bob La Follette</url>, a thundering populist who took on railroad companies and defended small farmers.</p><p>Lest you think that Hawley is all talk, the legislation he has introduced suggests he is breaking from the Republican establishment in real ways.</p><p>He has introduced a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">bipartisan bill to ban</url> the sale to minors of predatory video game \"loot boxes\", an addictive technology that is being used by the electronic gaming industry to suck money out of children. His drug pricing bill       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">would ban pharmaceutical companies</url> from charging Americans more for the same prescription drugs than they charge to customers in other industrialized countries.</p><p>His <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">college debt legislation</url> would hold well-off colleges and universities directly accountable for offering expensive or mediocre educations to their students; the bill would require institutions to pay off 50% of the balance of loans of students who default. Legislation he introduced with the Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">would impose fees</url> on foreign capital in order to revalue the dollar in a way that would increase US exports.</p><p>Perhaps his biggest foe is Silicon Valley, which he blames for pursuing a \"business model of addiction\". He has introduced legislation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">that would ban</url> certain social media company practices - such as autoplay videos and endless scrolling - that he blames for manipulating human psychology.</p><p>The conservative establishment's response to Hawley's crusade against these powerful economic titans has been skeptical. The National Review's David French <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">argued</url> that Hawley's bill regulating big tech practices was an \"affront to limited government and personal responsibility\".</p><p>Arguments in favor of limited government and personal responsibility have their place, but the conservative movement's modus operandi has long been to advocate personal responsibility for society's poorest and most vulnerable but not society's most powerful. Who has held big tech responsible for its role in promoting technologies that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">may foster</url> addiction and suicide? Is the pharmaceutical industry acting responsibly when it is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">pricing drugs out of the reach</url> of ordinary Americans?</p><p>When a younger Hawley sat down and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">wrote a book</url> about a towering Republican figure in 2008, he chose to profile not Reagan but Teddy Roosevelt, the progressive populist Republican president from the early 20th century. Writing about Roosevelt       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-party-platform-1956\">in a 2010 essay</url>, Hawley is clearly wary of too much intervention by the government into the economy, but he also recognizes that individuals alone can't create the opportunities necessary for everyone to thrive.</p><p>\"Theodore Roosevelt and the strand of Progressivism he represented may have assigned government too great a role in reforming society, but Roosevelt was right to recognize that society and liberty go together,\" Hawley writes. \"Self-determination requires a certain social context.\"</p><p>We shouldn't expect Hawley to transform into Bernie Sanders. He is not an advocate of democratic socialism, and it is important for us to have parties with distinct visions that offer voters genuinely contrasting choices. But for too long, the Republican party has embraced market libertarian thinking that pretends that the solution to any social problem is a change in individual behavior.</p><p>While it's true that we all choose the paths we walk, we don't create the paths. None of us as individuals can simply conjure up an alternative to overpriced insulin. We can't just use another social media service when Google and Facebook are monopolies. Roosevelt understood that and it appears Hawley does as well.</p><p>The question is whether the Republican party will heed the Missouri senator's warnings about where conservatism has gone wrong.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Zaid Jilani is a Bridging the Divides writing fellow at the University of California, Berkeley's Greater Good magazine, and a freelance journalist</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-55099803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS5-FWV1-F021-639X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><timeReceived>11:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Trump supported the deal, but many Republicans opposed it. Trump once again called for rapper A$AP Rocky's release and criticized the Swedish prime minister for failing to intervene in the case. Despite Mueller's warning about ongoing Russian election interference, Senate Republicans have blocked a series of election security bills since the special counsel testified. Mitch McConnell argued that the bills were too partisan and that addressing election security must engage both parties. But Democrats slammed him for his inaction as the 2020 election looms. A few Democrats have come out in favor of impeachment since Mueller's testimony. But Nancy Pelosi has still shown no signs of backing an inquiry. Democratic presidential candidates slammed the Trump administration's decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The House oversight panel voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas of the Trump administration's nonofficial communications. And to cap off our day, a story about congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida, whose signature looks include an array of wonderfully colorful hats. Wilson is reconsidering her trademark style, according to The Miami Herald. Fear, not fashion, is the reason. Wilson, a 76-year-old Miami-Dade Democrat serving her fourth term in the House of Representatives, said she made the decision after an unsettling phone call to her homefollowing her visit - as part of a Democratic delegation that included Georgia Rep. John Lewis - to the Homestead detention center, where more than 1,300 undocumented migrant children are being held... The caller, she said, argued that the Border Patrol page was protected under the First Amendment and while he didn't directly threaten her, suggested that her hats made her easy to find. Wilson, subject of a not-so-subtle threat in late June, said she was shaken. She said from now on, whether she wears a hat or not will be dictated by the event and whether she's in a public setting or not. The caller's number was reportedly provided to the police, though no arrests have been made. Here's hoping the threats abate so when Congress is back in session in September, Wilson can return to the House floor in full style. Candidates and activists who have long been campaigning for a presidential debate centered around the climate crisis will be getting somewhat what they want. A Climate Forum on September 19 and 20 will be open to 2020 presidential candidates from both parties. The event will be hosted by Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, in partnership with MSNBC and environmental news outlet Our Daily Planet. CNN will also be holding a Democratic town hall focused on the climate crisis a few days earlier, on September 4. Following the first Democratic debate in June, activists camped out in front of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters to demand a separate debate focused solely on climate change, complaining that fewer than 10 minutes of each two-hour debate were dedicated to discussing climate. Several journalists, including The Guardian's Emily Holden, agreed. DNC Chair Tom Perez has forbidden an official debate centered on climate change (though \"forums\" or a \"town halls\" are be allowed), arguing that such a debate would favor candidates like Washington governor Jay Inslee, whose entire campaign is built around environmental issues. Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer announced his detailed plan to address climate change today, as did senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several other 2020 Democratic candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and others have also released detailed plans. Other candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, as well as Warren and Gillibrand are co-sponsors of the Green New Deal. The majority of candidates support the deal. Members of the House of Representatives wrapped up for six-week summer recess, a day earlier than originally scheduled, after a packed week that included the Mueller hearings yesterday and the passing of a budget deal today. Yet another Democratic representative - Katherine Clark of Massachusetts - came out in support of impeaching Trump. Clark is the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus. The Senate voted to approve Trump's pick to be the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley. Milley is currently the chief of staff of the army. In his new position, he will serve as the top military adviser to the president. He will replace Joseph Dunford, who is retiring in the fall. Donald Trump is once again advocating for the rapper A$AP Rocky, who was charged with assault over a fight in Stockholm last month and has been held in custody since July 3. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven's office, in response to earlier entreaties by Trump to release the musician, said in a statement that he would not intervene in the case, noting that \"in Sweden everyone is equal before the law\". A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has insisted that he acted in self-defense. He posted videos on Instagram purporting to show the lead up to the confrontations, with two men who appear to be following the rapper and then attacking his security guard. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian West and Justin Bieber have rallied behind the rapper, with Kardashian West directly appealing to Trump to help free Mayers. Following the passage of the budget deal, Congress voted on an amendment, offered by Republican congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky to change the title of the bill to read \"A bill to kick the can down the road, and for other purposes.\" It did not pass. The budget deal negotiated by the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, passed, 284-149. Sixty-five Republicans voted for the Trump-backed deal, and 132 voted against it. Some fiscally conservative Republican lawmakers balked at the deal, which raises spending by $320bn without a clear plan for reining in deficit or debt. But Democrats are celebrating the deal as a sign that the left and right can work together and compromise in order to stave off a government shutdown and prevent the country from defaulting on its debt. That's it from me today. I'm turning the blog over to Maanvi Singh on the West Coast. Here is where the day stands so far. Despite Mueller's warning about ongoing Russian election interference, Senate Republican have blocked a series of election security bills since the special counsel testified. Mitch McConnell argued that the bills were too partisan and that addressing election security must engage both parties. But Democrats slammed him for his inaction as the 2020 election looms. A few Democrats have come out in favor of impeachment since Mueller's testimony. But Nancy Pelosi has still shown no signs of backing an inquiry. Democratic presidential candidates slammed the Trump administration's decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The House oversight panel voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas of the Trump administration's nonofficial communications. And the vote is underway now for the budget deal negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi. So stay tuned. The pro-Trump Republican looking to unseat representative Ilhan Omar is facing a felony charge for allegedly stealing from stores. Our colleague Jon Swaine reports: Danielle Stella was arrested twice this year in Minneapolis suburbs over allegations that she shoplifted items worth more than $2,300 from a Target and goods valued at $40 from a grocery store.... In a series of text messages, Stella said: 'I am not guilty of these crimes. In this country I am innocent until proven guilty and that is the law.' She added: 'If I was guilty of crimes, I would never run for public office, putting myself in the public eye under a microscope to be attacked by all political sides.'... She has accused Omar of being a criminal for advising immigrants how to avoid agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She said in a tweet that any representatives who fail to 'uphold the rule of law' should be ejected from office. Bill de Blasio responded in a pretty eye-popping way to Trump's accusation that the New York mayor and presidential candidate was not standing up for the city's police officers. Trump was reacting to viral videos that have emerged showing police officers getting doused with water as they respond to calls in the city. The president called on de Blasio to \"act immediately\" to the \"completely unacceptable\" behavior. De Blasio responded by noting that New York's crime rate has declined in recent years before making a jab about Trump's own record. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, has put out a statement criticizing the Trump administration's decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse. \"I have opposed the death penalty from back in my time as a prosecutor,\" Klobuchar said. \"It does not reduce crime, it is costly and it is discriminatory.... I disagree with the president's decision.\" Fellow candidate Bernie Sanders earlier responded to the news by calling for abolishing the death penalty. \"There's enough violence in the world,\" Sanders wrote on Twitter. \"The government shouldn't add to it. When I am president, we will abolish the death penalty.\" It isn't just Russia: Twitter has shut down more than 7,000 phony accounts from Iran this year alone. Researchers say America is likely to see more foreign disinformation in the 2020 elections than ever before, as additional countries launch campaigns to influence the US electorate. The Washington Post reports: A short list of countries that host online influence operations with a history of meddling across borders includes Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, researchers say. They say it's not often not clear exactly who runs these operations - whether it's the governments themselves or some other actors - but they typically echo the talking points of the ruling powers and back their geopolitical goals through tweets, posts and online videos.... The influence operations in these countries, however, do not all share Russia's demonstrated preference for Trump and other Republicans. The Iranians, for example, typically oppose Trump in their disinformation messaging, criticizing his decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and administration policy on other issues, including Israel and the civil wars in Yemen and Syria, research shows. Another Democrat, representative Peter DeFazio, announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. \"I believe that the time has come for the Judiciary Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry and collect the evidence necessary to build a strong case against President Trump,\" DeFazio said in a statement. \"His presidency is a danger to our national security and a threat to our democracy.\" DeFazio's announcement brings the total number of House members supporting impeachment up to 95, according to a CNN count. The Oregon congressman is also the second Democrat, after Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, to back impeachment after special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony. The confirmation process for Air Force general John E. Hyten to become the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will advance despite sexual misconduct allegations against him. Hyten was nominated to become the military's No. 2 officer in April, but an Army colonel alleges he repeatedly made sexually abusive contact with her. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Hyten's confirmation hearing could occur as soon as next week. Inhofe met with Hyten today to discuss the allegations, which he denies. Members of the committee have also previously met with Hyten's accuser, and questions about her allegations are sure to dominate the hearing. Senate Republicans have twice blocked legislation aimed at strengthening US election security in the 24 hours since special counsel Robert Mueller warned that Russian election interference remains ongoing. \"It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here,\" Mueller said of Russia's efforts during his congressional testimony yesterday. \"And they expect to do it during the next campaign.\" But since he left the witness stand, Republican senators have blocked a House-backed bill and a separate trio of bills meant to beef up US election security. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell criticized the House bill as \"so partisan it received just one Republican vote over in the House,\" asserting that any election security proposal must be bipartisan. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer fired back against McConnell by accusing Republicans of having \"buried commonsense election security bills in their legislative graveyard.\" Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google, accusing the search engine giant of stifling her free speech by briefly suspending her campaign's advertising account. The Hawaii congresswoman is seeking an injunction against Google, as well as damages of at least $50 million. Gabbard's complaints about the suspension seemed to eerily echo accusations from Republicans that Google discriminates against conservative voices. \"Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"This is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.\" The company blamed the Gabbard campaign's brief suspension after the first Democratic debate on an automated system that flags unusual activity, asserting that they provide ad products \"without bias toward any party or political ideology.\" The Senate intelligence committee has released some of its findings from the panel's bipartisan investigation into Russian election interference. The first volume of the report includes many blacked-out redactions, but Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said he hoped the findings would \"provide the American people with valuable insight into the election security threats still facing our nation and the ways we can address them.\" \"Our bipartisan investigation identified multiple problems and information gaps that hindered our ability to effectively respond and defend against the Russian attack in 2016,\" Democratic vice chairman Mark Warner added. \"I hope the bipartisan findings and recommendations outlined in this report will underscore to the White House and all of our colleagues, regardless of political party, that this threat remains urgent, and we have a responsibility to defend our democracy against it.\" The report's release comes one day after special counsel Robert Mueller emphasized in his congressional testimony that Russian election interference remains ongoing. \"It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here,\" Mueller said. \"And they expect to do it during the next campaign.\" A staffer for the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA was fired after it was discovered that Trump appeared at the group's event Tuesday in front of a doctored presidential seal that bore a resemblance to the Russian coat of arms. The fake seal showed a two-headed eagle, similar to the Russian Federation's state seal, holding a set of golf clubs in its talons. Turning Point USA said there was \"zero malicious intent\" behind the use of the doctored seal, blaming the error on a haphazard Google search. \"We're sorry for the mix-up and meant no disrespect to the White House or the President or the advance team,\" a Turning Point spokesperson said. A source said the now fired individual was told hours before the event that the team needed a presidential seal for the screen behind Trump, and the person \"did the search and with the pressure of the event, didn't notice that it is a doctored seal.\" Representative Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman who was the subject of a \"Send her back\" chant at a Trump campaign rally, wrote a New York Times op-ed urging Americans to respond forcefully to the president's racist comments. Omar writes: The president's rally will be a defining moment in American history. It reminds us of the grave stakes of the coming presidential election: that this fight is not merely about policy ideas; it is a fight for the soul of our nation. The ideals at the heart of our founding - equal protection under the law, pluralism, religious liberty - are under attack, and it is up to all of us to defend them.... The only way to push back is to be unequivocal about our values. It is not enough to condemn Mr. Trump's racism. We must affirmatively confront racist policies - whether the caging of immigrant children at the border or the banning of Muslim immigrants or the allowing of segregation in public housing.... Today, democracy is under attack once again. It's time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before. Representative Mark Meadows, a close ally of Trump's, said he did not think the president's tweet endorsing the budget deal would sway any members of the House Republican caucus. \"We don't believe that we should bankrupt America,\" Meadows said, voicing conservatives' concerns about the bill raising federal spending by more than $300 billion. \"We have a difference of opinion on this particular issue and one that's not going to change.\" Most House Republicans are expected to vote \"no\" on the proposal, which is expected to come up for a vote later today. But the bill could still pass with mostly Democratic support. Jeffrey Epstein has been placed on suicide watch after being found unconscious in his Manhattan jail cell with injuries to the neck. Epstein, who is in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, told officials that he was beaten up and called a child predator, according to CNN. His injuries are reportedly not serious, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons has declined to comment on the matter. The divorce case of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has taken another dramatic turn, with the former New York mayor saying the prolonged split forced him to borrow $100,000 from a colleague. Giuliani said after a hearing in New York state court that he borrowed the six-figure sum from fellow Trump lawyer Marc Mukasey after his wife, Judith Giuliani, tied up a joint bank account. \"I had to borrow the money to pay taxes, because she was holding up the account,\" Giuliani said outside the Manhattan courtroom. \"I'll pay that back to him as soon as this is decided.\" Although Giuliani shouted at his wife's lawyer during a previous hearing, it was Judith who was chastised by the judge today for an outburst. When Giuliani's lawyer accused her of taking items from their New York condo that did not belong to her, Judith pounded the table and yelled, \"I did not!\" The judge replied, \"I'm not going to tolerate any outbursts.\" The case is headed toward trial in January. Trump spoke to the president of the Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to congratulate him on his recent election, the White House said in a statement. \"President Trump and President Zelenskyy discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and economic cooperation,\" a White House spokesperson said. \"Both leaders also expressed that they look forward to the opportunity to meet.\" The House oversight committee has voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas for all White House work communications sent via personal email and cellphone. The panel asked the White House earlier this month for all communications sent via nonofficial means in their investigation of whether the Trump administration violated federal record-keeping laws. The request followed reports that some officials, including the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been communicating using personal email accounts and encrypted apps. After a heated debate between the panel's Republicans and Democrats on the issue, the committee voted 23-16 to authorize subpoenas. \"I don't know how to say this any differently: We have laws,\" Cummings said during the debate. \"And the laws say we keep official records.\" Republican representative Jim Jordan fired back that his Democratic colleagues were trying to \"go after the emails of the first family in an attempt to create an appearance of some type of controversy.\" The passed resolution allows Cummings to subpoena records sent using nonofficial means, \"including text messages, phone-based message applications, or encryption software, that were not forwarded to the official accounts of the employees within 20 days.\" Here's where the day stands so far. The Justice Department announced it would resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. They have scheduled five executions of death-row inmates, with the first execution set for December 9. Nancy Pelosi has told House Democrats that they have to do their \"own thing\" when it comes to supporting an impeachment inquiry against Trump. It was reported after special counsel Robert Mueller's hearing that the House speaker had pushed back against entreaties to launch impeachment proceedings. Most House Republicans are expected to oppose the budget deal negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi. Trump has encouraged his party's lawmakers to back the agreement, but a majority still seem inclined to vote \"no.\" That leaves the question of whether the president will actually sign a huge funding bill mostly backed by Democrats. And we're still watching this House judiciary committee hearing on the Trump administration's migrant family separation policy and the conditions of detention centers. Stay tuned. Trump just finished delivering remarks at a ceremony welcoming the new secretary of defense, Mark Esper. \"You're going to do a great job. I have absolutely no doubt,\" Trump said of Esper. The former Republican staffer and lobbyist secured Senate confirmation earlier this week by a vote of 90-8. He will be the Pentagon's first permanent chief since Jim Mattis, who resigned over policy differences with Trump and left the Defense Department in January. Brian Hastings, Custom and Border Protection's chief of law enforcement operations, contradicted a report that a 3-year-old migrant girl was forced to choose which of her parents would remain with her in the United States while the other was sent back to Mexico. NPR reported earlier this month that a Honduran girl named Sofia was faced with the heart-wrenching choice at a Border Patrol holding facility in El Paso, Texas. \"The agent asked her who she wanted to go with, mom or dad,\" Sofia's mother, Tania, said through an interpreter. \"And the girl, because she is more attached to me, she said mom. But when they started to take [my husband] away, the girl started to cry. The officer said, 'You said [you want to go] with mom.' \" But Hastings claimed during a House judiciary committee hearing that the child was not choosing which parent would be deported and which would remain in the United States. He said the whole family was sent back to Mexico but was briefly held in separate cells while they were processed at a detention center. According to Hastings, Sofia was only being asked which parent's cell she wanted to wait in. Only a fraction of the House Republican caucus is expected to support the budget deal negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Even though Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to back the two-year deal that would raise the debt ceiling and end harsh annual spending cuts, the party's House leadership expects most of its caucus to vote \"no\" on the deal. House minority whip Steve Scalise said Trump's supportive tweet \"helps\" build support within the caucus. But he added, \"We've heard from a lot of members who said they're voting 'No,' no matter what.\" The president has already said he backs the deal, but the idea of signing a massive funding bill mostly passed with Democratic support may make him reconsider. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has come out strongly against the Justice Department's announcement that it would resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The California senator has a unique history on the issue. She has consistently opposed capital punishment, a position that has landed her in hot water more than once. Most notably, while Harris was serving as San Francisco's district attorney, she refused to seek the death penalty against the man eventually convicted of killing police officer Isaac Espinoza. The decision was lambasted by the law enforcement community and even some of Harris' fellow Democrats, such as senator Dianne Feinstein. A migrant child said she was \"beaten and abused\" while detained at a facility in Clint, Texas. The alleged abuse occurred on March 12 and is still under investigation by the Customs and Border Protection's internal watchdog, NBC News reports. The allegation follows other accusations of abuse against migrant children, including an alleged sexual assault against a girl at a facility in Yuma, Arizona. House Democrats are expected to ask about the alleged abuse during a judiciary committee hearing on the Trump administration's migrant family separation policy and the conditions of detention centers. The hearing is already underway and can be watched live here. The US federal government has not executed a death-row inmate since 2003, when Louis Jones Jr. was put to death for the rape and murder of Pvt. Tracie Joy McBride. McBride was kidnapped from an Air Force base in Texas in 1995 and later beaten to death with a tire iron, a murder that Jones confessed to. Jones died by injection eight years later at the federal penitentiary near Terre Haute, Indiana, the same penitentiary where the Justice Department intends to carry out five more executions between December and January. The five executions scheduled by the Justice Department are set to take place between December 9 and January 15. The department noted the executions will take place at US Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, adding that additional executions \"will be scheduled at a later date.\" \"Each of these inmates has exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies, and currently no legal impediments prevent their executions,\" the Justice Department said in its statement. Presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand today rolled out what she is calling a \"climate change moonshot\" to \"save our planet.\" The Democratic senator from New York said in a blog post that \"climate change is the most serious threat to humanity today, and we need immediate and bold action to address it before it's too late.\" She said she would enact the Green New Deal and mobilize $10 trillion in public and private funding to neutralize America's share of the pollution heating the planet by 2050. The deadline aligns with other Democrats running for president, and the spending tops what most have proposed. Gillibrand wants to tax fossil fuel production to generate $100 billion annually for climate mitigation projects. She would put a price on carbon, requiring emitters to pay $52 per metric ton. The senator would also halt new fossil fuel leases on public lands and the outer continental shelf and invest $100 billion in preparing rural communities for the climate crisis. Her plan would require support from Congress. The Justice Department's noted in its statement about resuming capital punishment that the first person set to be executed belonged to a white supremacist group. \"Daniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white supremacist group, murdered a family of three, including an eight-year-old girl,\" the Justice Department's statement read. Lee was found guilty on three counts of murder, among other charges, in 1999. The department has set his execution for December 9. Trump has previously downplayed the growing threat of white nationalism and white supremacy. After a white supremacist attack on two mosques in New Zealand left 49 people dead in March, he was asked whether he considered white nationalism to be a rising threat around the world. \"I don't really,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\" The Justice Department said in a statement that it would resume capital punishment after a nearly two-decade lapse on the policy. The statement noted that Attorney General William Barr has asked the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five death-row inmates convicted of murder, with the first planned for December 9. \"Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,\" Barr said. \"The Justice Department upholds the rule of law-and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\" Nancy Pelosi told a CNN reporter that she has \"never\" discouraged fellow House Democrats from supporting an impeachment inquiry against Trump and that they need to follow their own instincts on the matter. But reports started emerging last night that the House speaker had rebuffed efforts to launch impeachment proceedings after special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony. Some House Democrats also have a deadline of the upcoming recess on their minds, according to CNN. They fear that the impeachment issue could lose momentum if it is not raised before the August recess. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is raising eyebrows with his hefty bill for private jet travel. The millennial mayor has spent $300,000 on private jets this year, more than any other Democratic presidential hopeful, the AP reports. Buttigieg's campaign defended the charter flights as a necessary expense, given its headquarters in South Bend, Indiana. \"We are careful with how we spend our money, and we fly commercial as often as possible,\" a Buttigieg spokesperson said. \"We only fly noncommercial when the schedule dictates.\" But his competitors seem to already be jumping on the potential gaffe. \"No private planes for this campaign,\" Beto O'Rourke said in a video posted to his campaign's YouTube channel on Monday. The pair of candidates may get a chance to spar over the travel issue next week. They are sharing the same stage on the first night of debates in Detroit. Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America have struck a deal with California to produce more fuel-efficient cars in the US. The agreement could undercut the Trump administration's efforts to relax gas mileage standards for American cars. The Washington Post reports: Mary D. Nichols, California's top air pollution regulator, said in an interview Wednesday that she sees the agreement as a potential 'olive branch' to the Trump administration and hopes it joins the deal, which she said gives automakers flexibility in meeting emissions goals without the 'massive backsliding' contained in the White House's current proposal.... In a joint statement, the four companies said their decision to hash out a deal with California was driven by a need for predictability, as well as a desire to reduce compliance costs, keep vehicles affordable for customers and be good environmental stewards. Trump is up and tweeting about the two-year budget deal that would raise the debt ceiling and end painful annual spending cuts. The president's unequivocal endorsement should relieve House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. When the deal between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House speaker Nancy Pelosi was announced, Trump said he was \"pleased\" with the agreement. But the lack of a full-throated endorsement worried some Republicans, particularly given a handful of conservatives' complaints about the deal. Trump's endorsement should quiet those concerns before Congress votes on the bill - assuming the president doesn't change his mind, which is always possible. Good morning, live blog readers! Washington is still processing everything we heard from special counsel Robert Mueller yesterday during his hearings before two House panels. But one (very important) person seems to have already reached a conclusion: Nancy Pelosi. The House speaker rebuffed judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler's entreaties to launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump during a closed-door meeting yesterday after Mueller's appearance. Pelosi called Nadler's idea to begin drafting articles of impeachment premature, standing by her insistence that the \"slow, methodical approach\" was the way to go. Pelosi is sure to be asked about her position on impeachment during a media availability later today. Here are a few other things the blog is keeping its eye on: Jeffrey Epstein was found unconscious in his Manhattan jail cell with injuries to the neck, the New York Post reports. The wealthy financier was denied bail last week and is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced he would resign effective 2 August, our colleague Oliver Laughland reports. Rossell\u00f3 has faced nearly two weeks of protests over misogynistic and homophobic comments he made in leaked text messages. US rapper A$AP Rocky has been charged with assault in Sweden. The artist has been in custody for more than three weeks following a fight in Stockholm late last month, and Trump has said he would reach out to Swedish authorities to discuss securing Rocky's release. The House judiciary committee will hold a hearing at 10 am EDT on migrant family separations and the conditions of migrant detention centers. The blog is covering all of that and more today.

He also pointed out that companies like Google and Facebook created products that consumers want -- so why should regulators break them up?</p><p>\"In the absence of anticompetitive conduct, is there anything about that that amounts to an antitrust violation?\" he asked.</p><p>One witness, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP Counsel Jan Rybnicek, thinks Big Tech isn't harming consumers -- and that breaking up Big Tech will harm them.</p><p>\"Not only is this proposal putting the cart before the horse as no clear market failure has yet been identified, but the solution itself is unworkable,\" he said. \"The proposal may sound simple in theory but it is anything but that in practice. For one, it is not clear exactly what these companies would be broken up into and how they would operate afterwards. ...In recent years there have been calls to dramatically reshape the antitrust laws to address what critics perceive to be an under-enforcement problem, including with respect to digital platforms and digital advertising.\"</p><p>But Yale University's Professor of Economics Fiona Scott Morton said there is an overwhelming amount of economic research and evidence that build a strong antitrust case against Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>The problem isn't how big the tech companies are, she said, but how they've suppressed and snuffed out competition in the advertising market to establish dominance and limit consumer choice.</p><p>\"If there were more competition in the marketplace, we wouldn't be so concerned about this problem,\" she said.</p><p>O'Kelley told the committee that over the past 20 years, the biggest tech companies (like Google and Facebook) have used anticompetitive practices and manipulated regulatory policies to widen profit margins.</p><p>O'Kelley and Morton both reminded the committee that consumer harms, like privacy abuses, are just a symptom of anticompetitive behavior. Antitrust isn't about \"bigness,\" and it isn't about breaking up companies just because they've harmed consumers.</p><p>\"The biggest loophole right now is advertising-supported companies seem to be free to consumers, so if we only look at the consumer price, you can do any advertising-based merger [or acquisition],\" O'Kelley said, \"and if you're Facebook and Google, you can acquire hundreds of companies and see no antitrust enforcement.\"</p><p>Hawley said it seems more online startups put money towards advertising dollars to work with Google's and Facebook's algorithms rather than toward the products they're developing, which suggests Google and Facebook control the ad market.</p><p>According to O'Kelley, Google's prioritization of its own in-house products and the ad market forced him to sell AppNexus to AT&amp;T.</p><p>\"They had so many different pieces to compete, that we could not compete,\" he said. \"Waiting for regulators to catch up, I had to sell my company. We have to figure out how to keep different businesses separate, Google can't share data across them. YouTube should be open to any advertising platform. There search data should be available to any platform or no platform. I think that's a very clear way to break them up or force them to act fairly.\"</p><p>Despite Graham's and Lee's skepticism towards antitrust, enough Republicans are on board with antitrust that they might help push an update to antitrust law -- like the one introduced by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he thinks regulators and lawmakers should deal with Big Tech in two ways: first through antitrust enforcement to address the underlying anti-competitive behaviors, and secondly through a federal privacy law to deal with some of the effects of those anticompetitive behaviors.</p><p>\"It's not against the law to be big, it's against the law to use that power in a predatory way, which is what they have done, by buying out innovators, suffocating competition, by controlling the ecosystem,\" he said at Tuesday's hearing. \"We need both antitrust enforcement and new privacy protection. We need them both. I think antitrust enforcement has an enormously important effect, I saw it myself in Microsoft litigation that I was instrumental in bringing. I think the same is true here.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons recounting several news reports that identified complaints about Google's anticompetitive conduct and privacy practices. Alphabet shares were little changed after the release of the letter. </p><p>The company declined to comment. Trump, speaking at a campaign-style rally in Evansville, Indiana, said his administration was standing up for free-speech rights and warned that large social media companies could not be allowed to \"control what we can and cannot see.\" \"You look atGoogle, Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants and I made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results,\" Trump said. \"We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices,\" he added, noting that \"it can go the other way some day too.\" Lawmakers from both major parties andGoogle's rivals have said this year they see an opening for increased regulation of large technology companies under the FTC's new slate of commissioners. U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh meets with Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 11, 2018. Photo: REUTERS/Ting Shen Google's critics say that ongoing European antitrust action against the web search leader and this year's data privacy scandal involving Facebook Inc and political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica demonstrate their concerns about the unchecked power of the tech heavyweights. About 90 percent of search engine queries in the United States flow throughGoogle. Facebook and Twitter executives are expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Sept. 5 about their efforts to deter foreign campaigns from spreading misinformation online ahead November's midterm elections. Lawmakers have criticized Alphabet for not scheduling a top executive, such as Chief Executive Larry Page, for the hearings. In 2013, the FTC closed a lengthy investigation ofGoogleafter finding insufficient evidence that consumers were harmed by how the company displayed search results from rivals. Trump accusedGoogle's search engine on Tuesday of promoting negative news articles and hiding \"fair media\" coverage of him. Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later said the White House was \"taking a look\" atGoogle, and that the administration would do \"some investigation and some analysis,\" without providing further details. Earlier this year, Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, and Representative Todd Rokita, a Republican, sent separate letters asking the FTC to probeGoogle. Simon, the new Republican chairman of the FTC, said in July the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. An FTC representative was not immediately available for comment. Hatch, at event hosted by reviews website andGooglerival Yelp Inc in May, said moves made by \"an entrenched monopolist\" deserve extra skepticism. \"They may well be used, not to further consumer welfare, but to foreclose competitors,\" he said, according to prepared remarks. Yelp, a local-search service, said in a statement that Hatch's letter was \"heartening to see\" as it underscored the bipartisan plea for FTC scrutiny ofGoogle. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671535694349745251762500073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T57-8J91-F03R-N1FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><timeReceived>5:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 31, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The bill from Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce; Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sits on both committees, is titled the 'Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act.' There are mounting calls to reform Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. </p><p>Lawmakers have complained about Big Tech's content moderation decisions and the legal immunity the companies enjoy has come under severe scrutiny. \"For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,\" Wicker said in a statement. Graham aired similar concerns, saying social media companies routinely censor content considered valid political speech. In a tweet early on Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal the legal shield. \"Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!,\" Trump said, referring to an image that transposed McConnell's face onto that of a Russian guard in Moscow's Red Square. In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms' content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230. Trump took that action after Twitter tagged the president's unsubstantiated tweets about claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts. There are several other pieces of legislation targeting Section 230 doing the rounds, including one from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune and another from Republican Senator Josh Hawley.

The bill from Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce; Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sits on both committees, is titled the 'Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act.'   There are mounting calls to reform Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Lawmakers have complained about Big Tech's content moderation decisions and the legal immunity the companies enjoy has come under severe scrutiny.   \"For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,\" Wicker said in a statement.   Graham aired similar concerns, saying social media companies routinely censor content considered valid political speech.   In a tweet early on Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal the legal shield.   \"Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!,\" Trump said, referring to an image that transposed McConnell's face onto that of a Russian guard in Moscow's Red Square.   In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms' content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230.   Trump took that action after Twitter tagged the president's unsubstantiated tweets about claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.   There are several other pieces of legislation targeting Section 230 doing the rounds, including one from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune and another from Republican Senator Josh Hawley.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) speaks during an oversight hearing held by the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in Washington, U.S. June 24, 2020.   Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS   The bill from Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce; Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sits on both committees, is titled the \u2018Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act.\u2019   There are mounting calls to reform Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Lawmakers have complained about Big Tech\u2019s content moderation decisions and the legal immunity the companies enjoy has come under severe scrutiny.   \u201cFor too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,\u201d Wicker said in a statement.   Graham aired similar concerns, saying social media companies routinely censor content considered valid political speech.   In a tweet early on Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal the legal shield.   \u201cWhy does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!,\u201d Trump said, referring to an image that transposed McConnell\u2019s face onto that of a Russian guard in Moscow\u2019s Red Square.   In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms\u2019 content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230.   Trump took that action after Twitter tagged the president\u2019s unsubstantiated tweets about claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.   There are several other pieces of legislation targeting Section 230 doing the rounds, including one from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune and another from Republican Senator Josh Hawley.

The bill from Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce; Senator Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sits on both committees, is titled the \u2018Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act.\u2019   There are mounting calls to reform Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Lawmakers have complained about Big Tech\u2019s content moderation decisions and the legal immunity the companies enjoy has come under severe scrutiny.   \u201cFor too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,\u201d Wicker said in a statement.   Graham aired similar concerns, saying social media companies routinely censor content considered valid political speech.   In a tweet early on Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal the legal shield.   \u201cWhy does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!,\u201d Trump said, referring to an image that transposed McConnell\u2019s face onto that of a Russian guard in Moscow\u2019s Red Square.   In May, Trump signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms\u2019 content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230.   Trump took that action after Twitter tagged the president\u2019s unsubstantiated tweets about claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.   There are several other pieces of legislation targeting Section 230 doing the rounds, including one from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune and another from Republican Senator Josh Hawley.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43031670649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T0-XV21-F07F-83PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), one of Silicon Valley's harshest critics in Washington, D.C., introduced a new bill on Tuesday that would ban 'addictive' social media features. The legislation, if adopted, would impact several key features found on popular apps and sites like Instagram and YouTube. </p><p>Hawley's Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act aims to 'prohibit social media companies from using practices that exploit human psychology or brain physiology to substantially impede freedom of choice.' The SMART Act[1] would ban infinite scrolling and auto-refilling, something that's found on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Moving forward, companies would need its users to click a button or sign-off before showing them more content at the bottom of a page. Autoplaying content, a staple of YouTube, would also be outlawed unless a user has curated a playlist of multiple music videos; music streaming services would be exempt from the act's ban on autoplay features.

This would likely hit Snapchat, which keeps track of its users' 'streaks,' or how often they're talking and sending pictures to their friends. Hawley's proposed act also places an emphasis on how much time users are spending on social media. Platforms would be required to provide a 'user-friendly interface' that lets users set a time limit for their app usage. Companies would also have to implement their own time limit of 30 minutes per day for each user, according to the act; users would then be able to manually adjust the time limit or remove it altogether. 'Big Tech has embraced addiction as a business model,' Hawley tweeted on Tuesday. 'Their 'innovation' isn't designed to create better products, but to capture attention by using psychological tricks that make it impossible to look away. Time to expect more ...tter from Silicon Valley.' Also Read: Facebook Weathers Another Regulatory Storm: Does It Matter?[3] The act comes as there's mounting evidence social media can be detrimental to mental health. A 2017 study from the U.K.Royal Society for Public Health[4] reported that Instagram was the social app most detrimental to mental health for people ages 14-24, often exacerbating their depression, anxiety or body image issues. Instagram, in particular, makes young women 'compare themselves against unrealistic, largely curated, filtered and Photoshopped versions of reality,' the report said. Earlier this month, Instagram expanded a test hiding the total number of 'likes' on a user's post. 'We want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get,' an Instagram rep told TheWrap. Considering how likes and other forms of digital validation affect the brain, some social media experts believe it's a worthwhile test. Also Read: Instagram Goes Down for the Third Time in Just Over a Month[5] 'The brain responds to likes like any other reward or thing that excites the brain like food, sex or gambling,' Cal State Fullerton University/USC professor Ofir Turel recently told TheWrap. 'When you get likes, the reward system lights up and releases dopamine, making us feel good.' That good feeling can become fleeting, though, as users get hooked on checking their phones for social validation after posting a picture or video. Turel, who has studied the impact of social media on the brain for more than a decade, said users habitually check their phones \u2014 including 40% of Americans while driving \u2014 because Instagram and other platforms have created a 'variable reward,' something best associated with betting in a casino.Related stories from TheWrap: White House Launches Online Tool for Users to Report 'Political Bias' on Social Media[6]Joe Scarborough Tells Biden to Brush Off Social Media: 'Ignore the Blue Check Marks' (Video)[7]Why Social Media Goliath Jellysmack Is Betting Big on Participatory Video[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/Social-Media-Addiction-Reduction-Technology-Act.pdf\">https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/Social-Media-Addiction-Reduction-Technology-Act.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/david-simon-wire-trump-baltimore\">https://www.thewrap.com/david-simon-wire-trump-baltimore</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-weathers-another-ftc-doj-storm\">https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-weathers-another-ftc-doj-storm</url>/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/status-of-mind.html\">https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/status-of-mind.html</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/instagram-goes-down-for-the-third-time-in-just-over-a-month\">https://www.thewrap.com/instagram-goes-down-for-the-third-time-in-just-over-a-month</url>/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-white-house-tool-social-media-bias\">https://www.thewrap.com/trump-white-house-tool-social-media-bias</url>/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joe-scarborough-tells-biden-to-brush-off-social-media-ignore-the-blue-check-marks-video\">https://www.thewrap.com/joe-scarborough-tells-biden-to-brush-off-social-media-ignore-the-blue-check-marks-video</url>/ [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/why-facebook-goliath-jellysmack-is-betting-big-on-participatory-video\">https://www.thewrap.com/why-facebook-goliath-jellysmack-is-betting-big-on-participatory-video</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WRAP105650156451365350725176500089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRAP-5357</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPD-HPN1-JCMN-Y1S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><timeReceived>7:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Wrap</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He noted Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had concerns about the size of large companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon. \"A number of members of this committee are concerned with the scope and control of big tech,\" said Cruz, who worked with chairman-nominee Joseph Simons and potential commissioner Christine Wilson at the FTC 15 years ago. Gallant noted one of Simons' responses to Cruz, reminding lawmakers of an old joke in which Jesse James said he robbed banks because \"that's where the money is.\" For \"antitrust, the corollary is -- the place most likely to have antitrust problems -- is places that have market power. Those are the places you want to look the most, the places you want to be monitoring carefully and paying attention to,\" Simons said.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTX-8KN1-JC8G-80SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Twitter locked the account after McConnell's campaign shared a profanity-laced video of demonstrators protesting outside the Senator's Kentucky home, where he is currently recovering from a shoulder fracture.Tensions had already been on the rise and following the incident, and numerous Republicans and GOP organizations stood by McConnell, accusing the social media platform of being supportive of anti-Conservative propaganda.National Republican Congressional Committee Executive Director Parker Poling said that 'until [Twitter] corrects their inexcusable targeting of @Team Mitch' her organization would stop all spending on the platform.GOP chief of staff Richard Walters said in a tweet that the Republican Party and Trump campaign stood with the Kentucky senator. </p><p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee too would suspend all spending on Twitter until further notice.According to Associated Press, Trump's re-election campaign and Republican Party had planned to spend around $300,000 to $500,000 this month on Twitter ads.In an interview with WHAS, a Kentucky radio station, McConnell described himself as being in a major war with Twitter over their 'selective enforcement' rules. A photo taken in Vertou, western France shows logos of U.S. online news and social networking service Twitter. Photo: LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images 'The point that we wanted to make is Twitter is perfectly fine with carrying Massacre Mitch, which is obviously an invitation to violence, but when those kinds of words are directed at me they shut us down,' he said in reference to the video, which showed Black Lives Matter Louisville leader Chanelle Helm repeatedly cursing the Republican senator. The video has been taken down by Twitter.McConnell argued that Twitter did nothing when he was being labelled 'Massacre Mitch,\" a nickname he got on Twitter for not calling off the Senate recess to impose new gun regulations after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton[2] left 32 dead.Trump and the Republicans have accused social media platforms and Big Tech companies of being biased against them, with the Trump administration drafting a legislation to tackle this issue, according to Politico. Twitter and other platforms have denied these allegations and said that they have no political bias whatsoever.

That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch. That's a fact,' Representative Jim Jordan asserted at the top of his opening remarks.</p><p>The Ohio Republican then launched into examples where conservative voices, accounts posts and articles were, he claimed, either silenced or taken down - specifically voicing his concern that these actions have been taken on an election year. </p><p>'We're 97 days before an election, and the power - as the previous chairman and ranking member have said - the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what American citizens get to see before their voting, is pretty darn important,' he said.</p><p>'If it doesn't end, there have to be consequences,' he said of tech companies trying to influence elections and silence conservative voices.</p><p>He specifically pointed to Twitter taking censoring President Donald Trump's tweet last month when he asserted he would use 'force' if rioters attempted to establish an autonomous zone outside the White House. </p><p>'Former Facebook employees admit Facebook routinely suppressed conservative views,' Jordan said. </p><p>He also insisted that excuses from tech companies asserting that post removals from conservatives are 'just a glitch' are bogus.</p><p>'If I had a nickel for every time I hear, 'it's just a glitch,' I wouldn't be as wealthy as our witnesses but I'd be doing alright,' Jordan quipped.</p><p>Wisconsin Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, the ranking member of the Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee, said: 'Conservatives are consumers too, and they need the protection of the antitrust laws.' </p><p>But his attack feel flat when he asked Zuckeberg about Donald Trump Jr. being prevented from tweeting for 12 hours on Tuesday after promoting a discredited video claiming hydroxychloroquine could 'cure' Covid-19.</p><p>'I think that this is a legitimate matter of discussion. Why did that happen?' Sensenbrenner, 77, who is stepping down from Congress at the end of this term after 44 years asked.</p><p>'I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter,' Zuckerberg replied.</p><p>'It's hard for me to speak to that. I can talk to our policies about this. We do prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm.' </p><p>Jordan also pressed Pichai repeatedly on claims of anti-conservative bias at the search giant.</p><p>The Republican asserted that Google had 'helped' Hillary Clinton win in 2016 - which Google dispute strongly - and asked: 'Can you assure Americans that you won't tailor your features to help Joe Biden in 2020?'</p><p>Pichai replied: 'We don't do any work to politically tilt one war or another, it's against our core values.' </p><p>Other Republicans listed right-leaning websites they said they struggled to find on search, including The Gateway Pundit, and which had severely reduced traffic, including Breitbart. </p><p>Republican Matt Gaetz pressed Facebook's Zuckerberg on whether content moderators disadvantaged conservative content.</p><p>Zuckerberg said they were trained to be neutral. 'We aim to be a platform for all ideas,' he said. 'I certainly don't want our platform to be run in such a way to have a ... bias.'</p><p>And one Republican, Greg Steube, claimed that his campaign emails went to spam on Gmail solely because he is a Republican. </p><p>The former Florida state senator claimed he could 'prove' bias because the campaign emails even went to his father's spam folder and said he had 'never heard' of it happening to Democrats or 'read about it in the Press.'</p><p>Pichai responded that such systems are not biased - and then Florida Democrat Val Demmings said she had the same problem. </p><p>One Democrat, Jamie Raskin, called his Republican colleagues' questions 'fringe conspiracy theories.' </p><p>But Democrats had their own attack on the platforms. </p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline noted a series of popular conspiracy theories - including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax - that have thrived on Facebook's platform during the deadly virus\u00b4 grip across the globe.</p><p>'It brings the most activity which, of course, produces great profit,' Cicilline said to Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network's users don't want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. </p><p>But that only invited more push back from Cicilline, noted out that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u00b4t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus.</p><p>The video raked in more than 20 million views before Facebook started removing it, with dozens of other versions of it still cropping up. Earlier in the hourslong hearing, GOP congressmen had complained that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took down that same video at all, describing it as censorship.</p><p>Nodding to that political tightrope he\u00b4s walking on, Zuckerberg defended the company's misinformation policies, 'we've been quite aggressive in taking some of that down, as some of the questioning from the other side of the aisle has shown so far.'</p><p>But that was hardly the only drama in a day without recent Congressional precedent.</p><p>FACEBOOK'S ZUCKERBERG'S EMAILS REVEAL COMPETITION 'LAND GRAB' </p><p>In the most damaging moments, lawmakers unveiled Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internal emails boasting about buying competitors, saying Instagram was a threat as he plotted to purchase it, and talking about a 'land grab' on other competition.</p><p>Democratic Representative Joe Neguse bluntly told Zuckerberg he was running a monopoly in the tech marketplace as he read from the emails.</p><p>'You did tell one of Facebook's senior engineers in 2012 that you can, quote 'Likely just buy any competitive start up, but it will be a while until we can buy Google.' Do you recall writing that?' Neguse asked of the Facebook co-founder.</p><p>'Congressman, I don't specifically, but it sounds like a joke,' Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The newly revealed 2012 email chain, Neguse said, came directly after Facebook closed on its purchase of Instagram - one of its biggest competitors at the time.</p><p>In the emails, Zuckerberg detailed that his goal is to 'neutralize potential competitors,' especially those that could be 'disruptive' to Facebook.</p><p>'Here's why I ask these questions, Mr. Zuckerberg,' Neguse said in closing. 'It strikes me that over the course of the last several years, Facebook has used its market power to either purchase or replicate the competition.'</p><p>'And Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram are the most now downloaded apps of the last decade - and your company, sir, owns them all,' the Colorado representative concluded.</p><p>                     ZUCKERBERG'S EMAILS ON INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP WHICH REVEAL PLAN TO BUY OUT COMPETITION - AND JOKING ABOUT BUYING GOOGLE</p><p> House Democrats revealed a series of internal communications between Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives. Some are to unnamed recipients but others showed him emailing the company's chief financial officer David Ebserman in 2012 before buying Instagram, and then before the purchase of WhatsApp</p><p>'And we have a word for that - that word is monopoly.'</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that the documents obtained from the company 'tell a very disturbing story' of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>And Democra Pramila Jayapal asked Zuckerberg: ''Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company?'</p><p>When he replied 'no,' she said: 'I'd like to remind you that you're under oath,' then detailed how when Facebook bought Instagram, it was also developing a similar product called Facebook Camera. </p><p>Facebook acquired several social media and messaging apps - the most high-profile being Instagram and WhatsApp since growing to one of the most popular platforms in the world and the major social media power. It has also attempted to buy others, like SnapChat. </p><p>AMAZON'S BEZOS IS SLAMMED FOR PLAN TO KILL COMPETITION AND 'ABUSING' THIRD-PARTY SELLERS</p><p>Bezos, in his first ever appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Cicilline.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products. </p><p>'Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?' the committee chair asked.</p><p>'We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.'</p><p>But then Bezos said that he couldn't guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied. </p><p>Cicilline told how a one seller did well as a third-party on Amazon - but then the company launched its own version of their product but at a lower price.</p><p>He read the account of the seller who said: 'We called it Amazon heroin. Amazon strings you along for a while, because it feels so good to get that paycheck every week.' </p><p>Democrat Pramila Jayapal pressed Amazon's Bezos on whether the company used data from third-party sellers in making sales decisions. In a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied this under oath and was contradicted by a later news report.</p><p>Bezos answered cautiously that the company had a policy against such actions. 'If we found that somebody violated it, we would take action against them,' he said. </p><p>'We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,' Bezos said in a response to a question from Jayapal. 'But I can\u00b4t guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.' </p><p> But he came under sustained assault on what happened between his company and one-time competitor Diapers.com, with emails revealing how executives said it had to be beaten on price 'at any cost.'</p><p>Diapers.com and Soap.com were run by Quidsi, before the online retailer made a $545 million deal in late 2010 to buy the startup.</p><p>Amazon shut down its Quidsi unit, which runs websites Diapers.com and Soap.com, due to a persistent lack of profitability there in 2017.</p><p>At the time an Amazon spokesperson: 'Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh.'</p><p>AmazonFresh lets people shop online for grocery store goods, including pet, baby and beauty supplies.</p><p>Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore went on to create another online commerce company, Jet.com, which was bought last year by Walmart for about $3 billion in a move aimed at competing with Amazon. </p><p>                     'MATCH PRICING, NO MATTER THE COST...THEY EXPECT TO LOSE MONEY, THIS WILL MAKE IT WORSE.' HOW AMAZON TOOK DOWN DIAPERS.COM REVEALED                   </p><p> Emails from 2010 show Amazon's internal plan to take out Quidsi, which ran diapers.com and soap.com - which it then acquired.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I DIDN'T KNOW FACEBOOK INFLATED VIDEO CLAIMS - WHICH LED TO JOURNALISTS BEING FIRED (BUT I WON'T APOLOGIZE)</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg denied knowing that Facebook's video stats were inflated for more than a year during a Wednesday hearing before a House Judiciary subcommittee. </p><p>He had been asked about the scandal by Nadler, who tore into the Facebook boss because 'based on these metrics, news publishers fired hundreds of journalists, choosing instead to boost their video division.' </p><p>'Congressman, no I did not and we regret that mistake and we have put in place a lot of other measures since then,' Zuckerberg said. </p><p>Nadler gave Zuckerberg the opportunity to apologize. </p><p>'What do you have to say to the journalists who lost their jobs due to Facebook's deception?'</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't, instead replying, 'Congressman I disagree with that characterization and also your description of what ...'</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't finish his statement as Nadler snapped, 'OK, reclaiming my time.' </p><p>In October 2018, advertisers filed a complaint in California federal court, which was part of a 2016 lawsuit against the tech giant. </p><p>The filing, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, said that Facebook knew there was a problem in how the company measured viewership of videos on the platform for more than a year before publicly disclosing the issue in 2016. </p><p>Plaintiffs in the lawsuit called this fraud alleging Facebook knew of the irregularities by January 2015 and understood the impact within a few months, though didn't disclose the issue for more than a year. </p><p>The 2018 filing was based upon some 80,000 internal documents from the tech company obtained through the lawsuit. </p><p>Nadler opened up this particular bit of questioning with Zuckerberg by bringing up the stakes. </p><p>'The news and journalism industry in this country are in economic free-fall, over 200 counties in America no longer have a local newspaper and tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in recent years,' the New York Democrat began. </p><p>The reason journalism is in free-fall is that Google and Facebook now capture the vast majority of digital ad revenue,' he continued. 'Although news publishers produce valuable content, it is Google and Facebook that increasingly profit off that content.' </p><p>Nadler then accused Google and Facebook of practicing 'anti-competitive conduct,' which was the broader topic of the Wednesday hearing in the subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. </p><p>Nadler asked Zuckerberg if he realized the harm he caused journalists around the U.S. </p><p>Zuckerberg didn't answer questions directly about the media industry. </p><p>'Congressman, certainly I know how important it is that the metrics that we report are accurate and we've put in place additional measures to make sure we can audit those,' the Facebook boss said. </p><p>And Google was also attacked on its handling of media advertising, with Jayapal detailing how it operates a market in ads and accusing it of 'insider trading' by acting on the buy and sell sides of media advertising, and running the exchange system. </p><p>'YOU STOLE YELP'S REVIEWS': GOOGLE IN THE CROSSHAIRS</p><p> Cicilline alleged Google stole reviews from the company Yelp Inc and said Google threatened to delist the company from search results if it objected. </p><p>'Why does Google steal content from other businesses?' he said.</p><p>'The evidence we collected showed Google stole restaurant reviews from Yelp to bootstrap its own local search business. Do you know how Google responded when Yelp asked you to stop stealing their reviews? They threatened to delist them.' </p><p>Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>Pichai responded that he would want to know the specifics of the accusation. 'We conduct ourselves to the highest standards,' he added, disagreeing with the characterization that Google steals content from other businesses to keep users on its own services. </p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. </p><p>He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>'PUT YOUR MASK ON!' REPS SQUABBLE AMID PARTISAN SHOUTING MATCH </p><p>Tensions between Jordan and the subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline started early, when the Republican requested unanimous consent</p><p>Before yielding back to Cicilline, Jordan requested that his Republican colleague Rep. Mike Johnson, who is the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, be given time to speak.</p><p>A Democratic member objected and Cicilline rejected the request for Johnson to speak - which goes against usual precedent observed at subcommittee hearings.</p><p>Jordan was not pleased.</p><p>'Why are we not allowing - it is customary -' he began, but was cut off by Ciclline.</p><p>'This has never happened,' Jordan spoke over the chairman.</p><p>'Mr. Jordan, I have the time,' Cicilline shot back as he attempted to introduce the witnesses for the hearing.</p><p>'We're talking about people's liberties here,' Jordan argued back, but Ciclline ignored him and continued in the hearing's procedures.</p><p>'Put your mask on!' another member could be heard yelling at Jordan.</p><p>Members are required to wear masks when they are not questioning witnesses.</p><p>'I'm going to remind members of the committee, unless you are speaking, our rules require you to wear a mask, according to the attending physician,' Cicillone said in another interruption of his introduction.</p><p>Jordan, who had already put on a face covering, indicated he had done so.</p><p>Cicilline clarified he was 'speaking about another member of this committee,' likely referencing Florida Republican Representative William Gregory Steube, who had his bandana mulled below his mouth.</p><p>About an hour into the hearing, the issues of masks came up again when Jordan got into a squabble with Pennsylvania Representative Mary Scanion.</p><p>'I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,' she said of Jordan's line of questioning to the witnesses, then began to ask a question of Bezos.</p><p>'Mr. Chairman we have the email, there is no fringe -' Jordan was cut off by a myriad of shouting from Democrats.</p><p>Cicilline shouted, 'Excuse me, it's not your time!,' while repeatedly pounding his gavel. 'Please be respectful.'</p><p>Jordan continued talking through the cross speak.</p><p>'Put your mask on!' Rep.

When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities,' he says.</p><p>He adds that Amazon hired an additional 175,000 employees during the coronavirus pandemic, including many who were laid off from other jobs. </p><p>Bezos includes personal information about his life before becoming a billionaire and how he was raised by a teen mother and Cuban immigrant adoptive father. </p><p>'It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country,' he says. </p><p>'We nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking.'</p><p>Zuckerberg also touched on the theme of the American success story, arguing that Facebook grew into a billion-dollar business 'the American way, by starting out with nothing and providing products that people find valuable. </p><p>'Although people around the world use our products, Facebook is a proudly American company. We believe in values - democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression - that the American economy was built on,' he says. </p><p>He also argues Facebook faces intense competition from large rivals adding: 'We compete against the companies appearing at this hearing, plus many others that sell advertising and connect people. We also compete globally, including against companies that have access to markets that we aren't in.'</p><p>Zuckerberg will also defend Facebook's acquisitions by saying the social-media platform helped companies like WhatsApp and Instagram grow. Both are owned by Facebook.</p><p>He plans to remind lawmakers of the competitive threat U.S. tech companies face from China, saying the Asian country is building its 'own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.'</p><p>The billionaire tech exec also renewed Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized. </p><p>In his prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing, Pichai argued that search - which Google dominates by most metrics - was broader than just typing a query into Google, and said he remained concerned about being relevant as people turn to Twitter, Pinterest or other websites for information.</p><p>'We know Google's continued success is not guaranteed. Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,' Pichai said.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook will tell the committee the company 'does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business. That is not just true for iPhone, it is true for any product category.'</p><p>He will argue the company's 'commissions are comparable to or lower than commissions charged by the majority of our competitors. And they are vastly lower than the 50 to 70 percent that software developers paid to distribute their work before we launched the App Store.' </p><p>The high-profile hearing was originally set for Monday but was postponed because Representative John Lewis will be lying in state until Wednesday.</p><p>The panel will question the companies as part of its sweeping probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers. </p><p>It will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the United States and is likely to set up a face-off between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties. </p><p>Many tech lobbying groups and industry critics say the hearing is unlikely to address core antitrust issues or bring new information to the table, however.</p><p>'There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,' said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at industry lobby group NetChoice. </p><p>The antitrust subcommittee is expected to release a report within weeks on their investigation into the companies.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department is also probing the big four tech platforms. Facebook and Amazon are also facing inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission, while U.S. states attorneys general are looking at Google and Facebook.</p><p>READ THE TECH CEOS' OPENING STATEMENTS </p><p>AMAZON'S BEZOS: I'M LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WE'RE MAKING IT COME TRUE FOR MILLIONS OF OTHERS                   </p><p> Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the Subcommittee. </p><p>I'm Jeff Bezos. I founded Amazon 26 years ago with the long-term mission of making it Earth's most customer-centric company. </p><p>My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p> Being pregnant in high school was not popular in Albuquerque in 1964. It was difficult for her. When they tried to kick her out of school, my grandfather went to bat for her. </p><p>After some negotiation, the principal said, 'OK, she can stay and finish high school, but she can't do any extracurricular activities, and she can't have a locker.' </p><p>My grandfather took the deal, and my mother finished high school, though she wasn't allowed to walk across the stage with her classmates to get her diploma.</p><p>Determined to keep up with her education, she enrolled in night school, picking classes led by professors who would let her bring an infant to class. She would show up with two duffel bags-one full of textbooks, and one packed with diapers, bottles, and anything that would keep me interested and quiet for a few minutes.</p><p>My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. </p><p>My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he'd be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. </p><p>We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents' dining room. My dad spent two weeks at Camp Matecumbe, a refugee center in Florida, before being moved to a Catholic mission in Wilmington, Delaware. </p><p>He was lucky to get to the mission, but even so, he didn't speak English and didn't have an easy path. </p><p>What he did have was a lot of grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. </p><p>You get different gifts in life, and one of my great gifts is my mom and dad. They have been incredible role models for me and my siblings our entire lives. </p><p>You learn different things from your grandparents than you do from your parents, and I had the opportunity to spend my summers from ages four to 16 on my grandparents' ranch in Texas. </p><p>My grandfather was a civil servant and a rancher-he worked on space technology and missile defense systems in the 1950s and '60s for the Atomic Energy Commission - and he was self-reliant and resourceful. </p><p>When you're in the middle of nowhere, you don't pick up a phone and call somebody when something breaks. You fix it yourself.</p><p>As a kid, I got to see him solve many seemingly unsolvable problems himself, whether he was restoring a broken-down Caterpillar bulldozer or doing his own veterinary work. </p><p>He taught me that you can take on hard problems. When you have a setback, you get back up and try again. You can invent your way to a better place. </p><p>I took these lessons to heart as a teenager, and became a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker out of an umbrella and tinfoil, and alarms made from baking pans to entrap my siblings.</p><p> The concept for Amazon came to me in 1994.</p><p>The idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles - something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world - was exciting to me.</p><p>At the time, I was working at an investment firm in New York City. When I told my boss I was leaving, he took me on a long walk in Central Park. </p><p>After a lot of listening, he finally said, 'You know what, Jeff, I think this is a good idea, but it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job.' </p><p>He convinced me to think about it for two days before making a final decision. </p><p>It was a decision I made with my heart and not my head. When I'm 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. </p><p>And most of our regrets are acts of omission - the things we didn't try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. </p><p>And I decided that if I didn't at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal. </p><p>The initial start-up capital for Amazon.com came primarily from my parents, who invested a large fraction of their life savings in something they didn't understand. </p><p>They weren't making a bet on Amazon or the concept of a bookstore on the internet. They were making a bet on their son.</p><p>I told them that I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment, and they did it anyway. </p><p>It took more than 50 meetings for me to raise $1 million from investors, and over the course of all those meetings, the most common question was, 'What's the internet?' </p><p>Unlike many other countries around the world, this great nation we live in supports and does not stigmatize entrepreneurial risk-taking.</p><p>I walked away from a steady job into a Seattle garage to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work.</p><p> It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself, dreaming that one day we might be able to afford a forklift. </p><p>Amazon's success was anything but preordained. Investing in Amazon early on was a very risky proposition. From our founding through the end of 2001, our business had cumulative losses of nearly $3 billion, and we did not have a profitable quarter until the fourth quarter of that year.</p><p>Smart analysts predicted Barnes &amp; Noble would steamroll us, and branded us 'Amazon.toast.'</p><p>In 1999, after we'd been in business for nearly five years, Barron's headlined a story about our impending demise 'Amazon.bomb.' </p><p>My annual shareholder letter for 2000 started with a one word sentence: 'Ouch.' </p><p>At the pinnacle of the internet bubble our stock price peaked at $116, and then after the bubble burst our stock went down to $6. Experts and pundits thought we were going out of business.</p><p> It took a lot of smart people with a willingness to take a risk with me, and a willingness to stick to our convictions, for Amazon to survive and ultimately to succeed. And it wasn't just those early years.</p><p>In addition to good luck and great people, we have been able to succeed as a company only because we have continued to take big risks. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. </p><p>Outsized returns come from betting against conventional wisdom, but conventional wisdom is usually right. </p><p>A lot of observers characterized Amazon Web Services as a risky distraction when we started. 'What does selling compute and storage have to do with selling books?' they wondered. </p><p>No one asked for AWS. It turned out the world was ready and hungry for cloud computing but didn't know it yet. </p><p>We were right about AWS, but the truth is we've also taken plenty of risks that didn't pan out. </p><p>In fact, Amazon has made billions of dollars of failures. Failure inevitably comes along with invention and risk-taking, which is why we try to make Amazon the best place in the world to fail.</p><p>Since our founding, we have strived to maintain a 'Day One' mentality at the company. By that I mean approaching everything we do with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit of Day One.</p><p>Even though Amazon is a large company, I have always believed that if we commit ourselves to maintaining a Day One mentality as a critical part of our DNA, we can have both the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. </p><p>In my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the best way to achieve and maintain Day One vitality. </p><p>Why? Because customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.</p><p>Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and a constant desire to delight customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. </p><p>As a result, by focusing obsessively on customers, we are internally driven to improve our services, add benefits and features, invent new products, lower prices, and speed up shipping times - before we have to. </p><p>No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it.</p><p>And I could give you many such examples. Not every business takes this customer-first approach, but we do, and it's our greatest strength. </p><p>Customer trust is hard to win and easy to lose. When you let customers make your business what it is, then they will be loyal to you-right up to the second that someone else offers them better service. </p><p>We know that customers are perceptive and smart. We take as an article of faith that customers will notice when we work hard to do the right thing, and that by doing so again and again, we will earn trust. </p><p>You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well- delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading, and automating their homes. </p><p>As I have said since my first shareholder letter in 1997, we make decisions based on the long-term value we create as we invent to meet customer needs.</p><p>When we're criticized for those choices, we listen and look at ourselves in the mirror. </p><p>When we think our critics are right, we change. When we make mistakes, we apologize. </p><p>But when you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you're doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.</p><p>Fortunately, our approach is working. Eighty percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall, according to leading independent polls. </p><p>Who do Americans trust more than Amazon 'to do the right thing?' </p><p>Only their primary physicians and the military, according to a January 2020 Morning Consult survey. </p><p>Researchers at Georgetown and New York University found in 2018 that Amazon trailed only the military among all respondents to a survey on institutional and brand trust. </p><p>Among Republicans, we trailed only the military and local police; among Democrats, we were at the top, leading every branch of government, universities, and the press. </p><p>In Fortune's 2020 rankings of the World's Most Admired Companies, we came in second place (Apple was #1). We are grateful that customers notice the hard work we do on their behalf, and that they reward us with their trust. </p><p>Working to earn and keep that trust is the single biggest driver of Amazon's Day One culture. </p><p>The company most of you know as Amazon is the one that sends you your online orders in the brown boxes with the smile on the side. </p><p>That's where we started, and retail remains our largest business by far, accounting for over 80% of our total revenue. The very nature of that business is getting products to customers. </p><p>Those operations need to be close to customers, and we can't outsource these jobs to China or anywhere else. </p><p>To fulfill our promises to customers in this country, we need American workers to get products to American customers. </p><p>When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities. </p><p>As a result, Amazon directly employs a million people, many of them entry-level and paid by the hour. </p><p>We don't just employ highly educated computer scientists and MBAs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. </p><p>We hire and train hundreds of thousands of people in states across the country such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas, and Idaho.</p><p>These employees are package stowers, mechanics, and plant managers. For many, it's their first job. </p><p>For some, these jobs are a stepping stone to other careers, and we are proud to help them with that. We are spending more than $700 million to give more than 100,000 Amazon employees access to training programs in fields such as healthcare, transportation, machine learning, and cloud computing. </p><p>That program is called Career Choice, and we pay 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma for in-demand, high-paying fields, regardless of whether it's relevant to a career at Amazon. </p><p>Patricia Soto, one of our associates, is a Career Choice success story. Patricia always wanted to pursue a career in the medical field to help care for others, but with only a high school diploma and facing the costs of post-secondary education, she wasn't sure she'd be able to accomplish that goal. </p><p>After earning her medical certification through Career Choice, Patricia left Amazon to start her new career as a medical assistant at Sutter Gould Medical Foundation, supporting a pulmonary medicine doctor. </p><p>Career Choice has given Patricia and so many others a shot at a second career that once seemed out of reach. </p><p>Amazon has invested more than $270 billion in the U.S. over the last decade. </p><p>Beyond our own workforce, Amazon's investments have created nearly 700,000 indirect jobs in fields like construction, building services, and hospitality. </p><p>Our hiring and investments have brought muchneeded jobs and added hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity to areas like Fall River, Massachusetts, California's Inland Empire, and Rust Belt states like Ohio. </p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, we hired an additional 175,000 employees, including many laid off from other jobs during the economic shutdown. </p><p>We spent more than $4 billion in the second quarter alone to get essential products to customers and keep our employees safe during the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>And a dedicated team of Amazon employees from across the company has created a program to regularly test our workers for COVID-19. We look forward to sharing our learnings with other interested companies and government partners.</p><p>The global retail market we compete in is strikingly large and extraordinarily competitive. </p><p>Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4% of retail in the U.S. </p><p>Unlike industries that are winner-take-all, there's room in retail for many winners. </p><p>For example, more than 80 retailers in the U.S. alone earn over $1 billion in annual revenue. </p><p>Like any retailer, we know that the success of our store depends entirely on customers' satisfaction with their experience in our store. </p><p>Every day, Amazon competes against large, established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and, of course, Walmart -a company more than twice Amazon's size. </p><p>And while we have always focused on producing a great customer experience for retail sales done primarily online, sales initiated online are now an even larger growth area for other stores. Walmart's online sales grew 74% in the first quarter. </p><p>And customers are increasingly flocking to services invented by other stores that Amazon still can't match at the scale of other large companies, like curbside pickup and in-store returns.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on these trends, which have been growing for years.</p><p>In recent months, curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200%, in part due to COVID19 concerns. </p><p>We also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart-companies that enable traditionally physical stores to put up a full online store almost instantaneously and to deliver products directly to customers in new and innovative ways-and a growing list of omnichannel business models.</p><p>Like almost every other segment of our economy, technology is used everywhere in retail and has only made retail more competitive, whether online, in physical stores, or in the various combinations of the two that make up most stores today. </p><p>And we and all other stores are acutely aware that, regardless of how the best features of 'online' and 'physical' stores are combined, we are all competing for and serving the same customers. </p><p>The range of retail competitors and related services is constantly changing, and the only real constant in retail is customers' desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience. </p><p>It's also important to understand that Amazon's success depends overwhelmingly on the success of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that also sell their products in Amazon's stores. </p><p>Back in 1999, we took what at the time was the unprecedented step of welcoming third-party sellers into our stores and enabling them to offer their products right alongside our own. </p><p>Internally, this was extremely controversial, with many disagreeing and some predicting this would be the beginning of a long, losing battle. </p><p>We didn't have to invite third-party sellers into the store. We could have kept this valuable real estate for ourselves. </p><p>But we committed to the idea that over the long term it would increase selection for customers, and that more satisfied customers would be great for both third-party sellers and for Amazon. </p><p>And that's what happened. Within a year of adding those sellers, third-party sales accounted for 5% of unit sales, and it quickly became clear that customers loved the convenience of being able to shop for the best products and to see prices from different sellers all in the same store. </p><p>These small and medium-sized third-party businesses now add significantly more product selection to Amazon's stores than Amazon's own retail operation. </p><p>Third-party sales now account for approximately 60% of physical product sales on Amazon, and those sales are growing faster than Amazon's own retail sales.</p><p>We guessed that it wasn't a zero sum game. And we were right - the whole pie did grow, third-party sellers did very well and are growing fast, and that has been great for customers and for Amazon. </p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores. More than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in our stores in 2019. </p><p>On top of that, we estimate that third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world. One of those sellers is Sherri Yukel, who wanted to change careers to be home more for her children. </p><p>She started handcrafting gifts and party supplies for friends as a hobby, and eventually began selling her products on Amazon. Today, Sherri's company employs nearly 80 people and has a global customer base. </p><p>Another is Christine Krogue, a stay-at-home mother of five in Salt Lake City. Christine started a business selling baby clothes through her own website before taking a chance on Amazon.</p><p>She has since seen her sales more than double, and she's been able to expand her product line and hire a team of part-time employees. Selling on Amazon has allowed Sherri and Christine to grow their own businesses and satisfy customers on their own terms. </p><p>And it is striking to remember how recent all of this is. We did not start out as the largest marketplace -eBay was many times our size. </p><p>It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay. </p><p>One such tool is Fulfillment by Amazon, which enables our third-party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers, and we take on all logistics, customer service, and product returns. </p><p>By dramatically simplifying all of those challenging aspects of the selling experience in a cost-effective way, we have helped many thousands of sellers grow their businesses on Amazon. </p><p>Our success may help explain the wide proliferation of marketplaces of all types and sizes around the world.</p><p>This includes U.S. companies like Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Target, as well as retailers based overseas but selling globally, such as Alibaba and Rakuten. </p><p>These marketplaces further intensify competition within retail. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other company - hundreds of thousands of jobs across 42 states. </p><p>Amazon employees make a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage (which we have urged Congress to increase). We've challenged other large retailers to match our $15 minimum wage. </p><p>Target did so recently, and just last week so did Best Buy. We welcome them, and they remain the only ones to have done so. </p><p>We do not skimp on benefits, either. Our full-time hourly employees receive the same benefits as our salaried headquarters employees, including comprehensive health insurance starting on the first day of employment, a 401(k) retirement plan, and parental leave, including 20 weeks of paid maternity leave. </p><p>I encourage you to benchmark our pay and benefits against any of our retail competitors.</p><p>More than 80% of Amazon shares are owned by outsiders, and over the last 26 years - starting from zero - we've created more than $1 trillion of wealth for those outside shareholders. </p><p>Who are those shareowners? They are pension funds: fire, police, and school teacher pension funds. </p><p>Others are 401(k)s-mutual funds that own pieces of Amazon. University endowments, too, and the list goes on.</p><p>Many people will retire better because of the wealth we've created for so many, and we're enormously proud of this. </p><p>At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things.</p><p>I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million. </p><p>I love garage entrepreneurs-I was one.</p><p>But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do.</p><p>I don't care how good an entrepreneur you are, you're not going to build an all-fiber Boeing 787 in your garage. </p><p>Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact on important societal issues. </p><p>The Climate Pledge is a commitment made by Amazon and joined by other companies to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net zero carbon by 2040. </p><p>We plan to meet the pledge, in part, by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian - a Michigan-based producer of electric vehicles. </p><p>Amazon aims to have 10,000 of Rivian's new electric vans on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. </p><p>Globally, Amazon operates 91 solar and wind projects that have the capacity to generate over 2,900 MW and deliver more than 7.6 million MWh of energy annually - enough to power more than 680,000 U.S. homes. </p><p>Amazon is also investing $100 million in global reforestation projects through the Right Now Climate Fund, including $10 million Amazon committed in April to conserve, restore, and support sustainable forestry, wildlife and nature-based solutions across the Appalachian Mountains-funding two innovative projects in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy. </p><p>Four global companies-Verizon, Reckitt Benckiser, Infosys, and Oak View Group-recently signed The Climate Pledge, and we continue to encourage others to join us in this fight.</p><p>Together, we will use our size and scale to address the climate crisis right away.</p><p>And last month, Amazon introduced The Climate Pledge Fund, started with $2 billion in funding from Amazon. </p><p>The Fund will support the development of sustainable technologies and services that in turn will enable Amazon and other companies to meet The Climate Pledge. </p><p>The Fund will invest in visionary entrepreneurs and innovators who are building products and services to help companies reduce their carbon impact and operate more sustainably. </p><p>We recently opened the largest homeless shelter in Washington state-and it's located inside one of our newest headquarters buildings in downtown Seattle. </p><p>The shelter is for Mary's Place, an incredible Seattle-based nonprofit. </p><p>The shelter, part of Amazon's $100 million investment in Mary's Place, spans eight floors and can accommodate up to 200 family members each night. It has its own health clinic and provides critical tools and services to help families fighting homelessness get back on their feet. </p><p>And there is dedicated space for Amazon to provide weekly pro-bono legal clinics offering counsel on credit and debt issues, personal injury, housing and tenant rights. </p><p>Since 2018, Amazon's legal team has supported hundreds of Mary's Place guests and volunteered more than 1,000 pro-bono hours. </p><p>Amazon Future Engineer is a global childhood-to-career program designed to inspire, educate, and prepare thousands of children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue a computer science career. </p><p>The program funds computer science coursework and professional teacher development for hundreds of elementary schools, introductory and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country, and 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. </p><p>Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed internships at Amazon. </p><p>There is a diversity pipeline problem in tech, and this has an outsized impact on the Black community. </p><p>We want to invest in building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for underrepresented minorities. </p><p>We also want to accelerate this change right now. To find the best talent for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with historically Black colleges and universities on our recruiting, internship, and upskilling initiatives. </p><p>Let me close by saying that I believe Amazon should be scrutinized. </p><p>We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors. </p><p>It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country.

Republican staffers on the House Judiciary Committee are blasting...</p><p>\u201cThe legislative branch is unnecessarily taking on work for which it is ill-equipped,\u201d says a GOP memo, which could bode poorly for hopes of bipartisan legislation to rein in Silicon Valley.    Republican staffers on the House Judiciary Committee are blasting the panel's management of Wednesday's high-stakes hearing into the tech industry , according to a GOP memo obtained by POLITICO \u2014 accusing Democrats of harboring \"predetermined conclusions\" about the outcome of a Silicon Valley probe that Congress is \"ill-equipped\" to carry out.    The GOP staffers also call for making conservative allegations of ideological bias a major focus of the hearing, whose stated purpose is to examine complaints of antitrust abuses in the biggest U.S. tech companies.      The Republican staffers prepared the lengthy memo for a Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing in which the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple will testify together for the first time, a historic collision between the power centers of Washington and Silicon Valley. The document points to some glaring fissures in the antitrust panel's probe, despite the widespread scrutiny the tech industry's practices have drawn from lawmakers of both parties, as well as the Trump administration's regulators and authorities in Europe.     The memo also points to some of the roadblocks that may lie in wait for attempts to crack down on the tech companies through legislation \u2014 a possible sign of good news for the industry.    The Republican staffers even raise doubts about future cooperation for the panel's probe, which for more than a year has shown rare signs of bipartisan cooperation.    \u201cThough this investigation began as a bipartisan endeavor, the majority\u2019s approach is raising grave concerns about whether it can continue on that basis, or whether it simply reflects the majority\u2019s efforts to promote predetermined conclusions under an unearned banner of bipartisanship,\u201d the memo reads.    The Republicans also argue that Congress' probe is duplicative, given that President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are already pursuing investigations into the four tech giants.    \u201cThe legislative branch is unnecessarily taking on work for which it is ill-equipped,\u201d the memo says. \u201cEven if this hearing suggests that any of these companies have violated antitrust laws, that would arguably not establish systemic problems with current antitrust laws. Changing laws in response to such findings would be premature.\u201d    And it lists GOP allegations of bias in Silicon Valley \u2014 charges the tech giants deny \u2014 as a top theme for the hearing, which Democrats had scheduled to home in on charges  of anticompetitive conduct by Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Democrats, including Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler of New York, have dismissed the bias allegations as baseless and politically driven.    \u201cPolitical bias in big tech should be decried, but antitrust won\u2019t solve it,\u201d reads the heading of one section of the memo.    The memo also argues that the global coronavirus pandemic is a reason for Congress to proceed with caution on new antitrust legislation.    \u201cCongress should arguably act with special deliberation as the economy seeks to recover from the effects of COVID,\u201d the memo reads.       Russell Dye, a spokesperson for the committee\u2019s Republicans, blamed Democrats for the release of the document.    \u201cIt\u2019s truly unfortunate that an internal document related to a sensitive congressional investigation was leaked to the press the evening before a seminal hearing on antitrust law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Democrats are clearly trying to undermine what was supposed to be a bipartisan investigation.\u201d    A spokesperson for subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.) declined to comment.    Judiciary\u2019s top Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, has hammered committee Democrats for not hosting the blockbuster session at the full committee level, which would give more members a chance to grill the CEOs.    And he made a last-minute plea for the committee to add Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the hearing line-up. Republican lawmakers are eager to question Dorsey about the social media company\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s tweets. The company offered the committee a briefing instead of his testimony, according to a source familiar with the plans, who spoke anonymously to discuss private deliberations.    The split over Wednesday's hearing is the latest instance of GOP Judiciary members taking issue with Democrats\u2019 leadership of the tech investigation. Two other top Republicans accused Democrats in a February letter of having \u201cpre-conceived conclusions that America\u2019s large tech companies are inherently bad.\u201d Cicilline disputed the assertion at the time.    Despite the recent rebukes, other GOP lawmakers on the committee have continued to laud its Democratic leadership for their bipartisanship in the investigation. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with the bipartisan and cooperative nature of the process that we are going through,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) told POLITICO in an interview last week.    And a number of the committee\u2019s actions in the investigation have featured backing from both Democrats and Republicans, including a May letter demanding that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos testify before the panel .    Buck added that he expects bipartisan buy-in for the report the committee is expected to issue at the conclusion of its investigation.    \u201cEverything that I know about the drafting of that report indicates to me that it will be bipartisan and very thoughtful in its approach and therefore I do not foresee any objections,\u201d he said.    Parts of the memo echo the views of the Chamber of Commerce, America\u2019s biggest business lobby, which counts Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as members. The Chamber launched a website Tuesday making many of the same points.    Many of the memo\u2019s footnotes cite Republican antitrust officials, including former FTC chairs Tim Muris and Maureen Ohlhausen;  former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright; and Deb Garza, a former DOJ antitrust official. Muris has represented Facebook and Intel, while Wright\u2019s clients include Google and Qualcomm. Wright and Muris both teach at George Mason University\u2019s law school. Wright helms the law school\u2019s antitrust institute, which has received funding from Google and Amazon, according to a New York Times report .    Garza, who also helmed a congressionally appointed 2007 panel on modernizing antitrust, is a partner at Covington &amp; Burling, which frequently represents Facebook, including in its deal to purchase WhatsApp.    The memo\u2019s conclusions \u2014 that U.S. antitrust laws are working and don\u2019t need to be changed for the digital age \u2014 match the traditional Republican views on antitrust, and indicate that any legislative proposals the panel\u2019s Democrats seek to include in the investigation\u2019s final report may have difficulty gaining broad bipartisan support.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The order came after the president and a number of others on the Right opined publicly about Big Tech putting \u201ctheir thumb on the scale for the political left\u201d ahead of November\u2019s election. However, before going any further, the administration should consider the long-term effects of this move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A highly regulated internet, which fails to rely on the free market principles that conservatives hold dear, could stifle more conservative speech than it protects.</p><p>The president has embraced social media to speak directly to his millions of followers more than any other politician to date. In many respects, this is thanks to a previously obscure portion of law known as Section 230. This law limits the liability that online platforms face for hosting and moderating content that users create. Prior to this law, platforms faced a tough dilemma: moderate everything or nothing at all. Section 230 freed platforms from this \u201cmoderator\u2019s dilemma\u201d and simultaneously flipped the paradigm of traditional broadcast media.</p><p>Indeed, for a long time before social media came to be, conservatives bemoaned traditional media for its liberal tilt. However, social media gave conservatives a platform where they could establish brands on their own terms and create their own ecosystem. Big names, including Tomi Lahren, James O\u2019Keefe, and Dennis Prager, built massive social media followings they almost certainly could not have achieved relying solely on television or print. The freedom to moderate (or not moderate) online content, enabled by Section 230, very much built the media framework that put Trump and other Republicans into office.</p><p>But as more users share information and connect online, moderation practices enabled by Section 230 have come under scrutiny. There are reasons to suspect that implicit biases may make their way into moderation decisions. But regardless of the extent of anti-conservative bias, there have at least been anecdotal cases of speech from conservatives being removed from platforms, while speech from more liberal groups and individuals has not. As a result, many conservatives feel victimized by Section 230 and are looking for ways to fix it. </p><p>Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s designee in this fight, Sen. Josh Hawley (a Republican from Missouri), seems to either not understand the \u201cmoderator\u2019s dilemma\u201d or not care about the nuances of content moderation.</p><p>His new bill would revoke the protections of Section 230 from platforms with over 30 million U.S. users and $1.5 billion in global revenue, unless they disclose, in advance, the policies they use for moderating content, and also pledge to follow that policy down to the letter without any \u201cintentionally selective enforcement.\u201d Any failure to make good on that promise opens up the provider to damages of at least $5,000 per user. That means that even if these platforms maintain Section 230 immunity, they\u2019re no less immune to frivolous lawsuits. Rather, the clearly defined immunity Section 230 provided would be replaced by a legally ambiguous \u201cgood faith\u201d standard.</p><p>To win these legal battles would be no relief, either, as platforms will still have wasted time and money on these cases and likely stalled any decisions about updating their moderation policies in the meantime. Keep in mind that this bill would disincentive platforms from moderating content for fear of lawsuit. Your favorite social media platform could end up flooded with spam and other undesirable content, drowning out many voices.</p><p>However, many of these social media companies are risk averse, meaning that platforms will likely opt-out of these new perverse Section 230 \u201cprotections\u201d that would allow the proliferation of lawsuits and instead over-remove content, restrict the ability of users to post, or abandon attempts at moderation altogether in order to avoid liability. Some platforms may also over-moderate inflammatory content that could be considered defamatory because the victim of the speech will have every right to a lawsuit. </p><p>In short, toying with liability protections is sure to backfire. If platforms over-moderate content, it will stifle the voices of many, including conservatives. While some big conservative names could pivot back to traditional media, many voices who don\u2019t fit within traditional media will not be able to leverage social media to raise their public profile. </p><p>If the situation sounds dire, that's because it is. </p><p>Fortunately, we don\u2019t need to find out. As both Trump and Hawley have ignored thus far, a traditional Republican solution to many problems works equally well here: the free market.</p><p>Users do not have to use Twitter or Facebook. There are myriad other social media applications available today. If, for example, the president announces he will be taking his Twitter talents to Gab, the right-wing social media platform that already exists today, thousands of users would follow him to the new service. And even if no platform fits perfectly, the costs of creating a rival social media service are relatively low, and conservative networks exist irrespective of any one service. </p><p>While many conservatives are worried about social media bias, we must be extremely careful when altering the legal regime that created the modern internet, as even seemingly minor changes can have a drastic impact on internet speech. But if these concerns warrant a response, let\u2019s rely on the free market principles that for so long have guided conservatives and led to the success of the global internet to date. Without it, those worried about social media bias might remember the words of Randy Bachman: You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.</p><p>Shoshana Weissmann (@SenatorShoshana) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.

The order came after the president and a number of others on the Right\u00a0opined [2]\u00a0publicly about Big Tech putting \u201ctheir thumb on the scale for the political left\u201d ahead of November\u2019s election. However, before going any further, the administration should consider the long-term effects of this move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A highly regulated internet, which fails to rely on the free market principles that conservatives hold dear, could stifle more conservative speech than it protects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president has embraced social media to speak directly to his millions of followers more than any other politician to date. In many respects, this is thanks to a previously obscure portion of law known as Section 230. This law limits the liability that online platforms face for hosting and moderating content that users create. Prior to this law, platforms faced a tough dilemma:\u00a0moderate [3]\u00a0everything or nothing at all. </p><p>Section 230 freed platforms from this \u201cmoderator\u2019s dilemma\u201d and simultaneously flipped the paradigm of traditional broadcast media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for a long time before social media came to be, conservatives bemoaned traditional media for its liberal tilt. However, social media gave conservatives a platform where they could establish brands on their own terms and create their own ecosystem. Big names, including Tomi Lahren, James O\u2019Keefe, and Dennis Prager, built massive social media followings they almost certainly could not have achieved relying solely on television or print. The freedom to moderate (or not moderate) online content, enabled by Section 230, very much built the media framework that put Trump and other Republicans into office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as more users share information and connect online, moderation practices enabled by Section 230 have come under scrutiny. There are reasons to suspect that\u00a0implicit biases [4]\u00a0may make their way into moderation decisions. But regardless of the extent of anti-conservative bias, there have at least been anecdotal cases of speech from conservatives being removed from platforms, while speech from more liberal groups and individuals has not. As a result, many conservatives feel victimized by Section 230 and are looking for ways to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s designee in this fight, Sen. Josh Hawley (a Republican from Missouri), seems to either not understand the \u201cmoderator\u2019s dilemma\u201d or not care about the nuances of content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His new\u00a0bill [5]\u00a0would revoke the protections of Section 230 from platforms with over 30 million U.S. users and $1.5 billion in global revenue, unless they disclose, in advance, the policies they use for moderating content, and also pledge to follow that policy down to the letter without any \u201cintentionally selective enforcement.\u201d Any failure to make good on that promise opens up the provider to damages of at least $5,000 per user. That means that even if these platforms maintain Section 230 immunity, they\u2019re no less immune to frivolous lawsuits. Rather, the clearly defined immunity Section 230 provided would be replaced by a legally ambiguous \u201cgood faith\u201d standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win these legal battles would be no relief, either, as platforms will still have wasted time and money on these cases and likely stalled any decisions about updating their moderation policies in the meantime. Keep in mind that this bill would disincentive platforms from moderating content for fear of lawsuit. Your favorite social media platform could end up flooded with spam and other undesirable content, drowning out many voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many of these social media companies are risk averse, meaning that platforms will likely opt-out of these new perverse Section 230 \u201cprotections\u201d that would allow the proliferation of lawsuits and instead over-remove content, restrict the ability of users to post, or abandon attempts at moderation altogether in order to avoid liability. Some platforms may also over-moderate inflammatory content that could be considered defamatory because the victim of the speech will have every right to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, toying with liability protections is sure to\u00a0backfire [6]. If platforms over-moderate content, it will stifle the voices of many, including conservatives. While some big conservative names could pivot back to\u00a0traditional media [7], many voices who don\u2019t fit within traditional media will not be able to leverage social media to raise their public profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the situation sounds dire, that\u2019s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we don\u2019t need to find out. As both Trump and Hawley have ignored thus far, a traditional Republican solution to many problems works equally well here: the free market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users do not have to use Twitter or Facebook. There are myriad other social media applications available today. If, for example, the president announces he will be taking his Twitter talents to Gab, the right-wing social media platform that already exists today, thousands of users would follow him to the new service. And even if no platform fits perfectly, the costs of\u00a0creating [8]\u00a0a rival social media service are relatively low, and conservative networks exist irrespective of any one service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many conservatives are worried about social media bias, we must be extremely careful when altering the legal regime that created the modern internet, as even seemingly minor changes can have a drastic impact on internet speech. But if these concerns warrant a response, let\u2019s rely on the free market principles that for so long have guided conservatives and led to the success of the global internet to date. Without it, those worried about social media bias might remember the words of Randy Bachman: You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Endnotes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cexecutive order\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/will-trumps-executive-order-harm-online-speech-it-already-did\">https://www.lawfareblog.com/will-trumps-executive-order-harm-online-speech-it-already-did</url>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201copined\u201d:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFgsYCQtML8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cmoderate\u201d:\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFgsYCQtML8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cmoderate\u201d:</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rstreet.org/2018/03/21/the-roots-of-section-230-show-why-we-shouldnt-abandon-intermediary-liability-protection/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cimplicit\">https://www.rstreet.org/2018/03/21/the-roots-of-section-230-show-why-we-shouldnt-abandon-intermediary-liability-protection/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cimplicit</url> biases\u201d:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rstreet.org/2019/12/05/when-it-comes-to-content-moderation-weve-been-focusing-on-the-wrong-type-of-bias/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cbill\u201d:\">https://www.rstreet.org/2019/12/05/when-it-comes-to-content-moderation-weve-been-focusing-on-the-wrong-type-of-bias/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cbill\u201d:</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Limiting-Section-230-Immunity-to-Good-Samaritans-Act.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cbackfire\u201d:\">https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Limiting-Section-230-Immunity-to-Good-Samaritans-Act.pdf&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cbackfire\u201d:</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/06/22/why-we-need-section-230/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ctraditional\">https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/06/22/why-we-need-section-230/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ctraditional</url> media\u201d:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624-chapter-14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ccreating\u201d:\">https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624-chapter-14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ccreating\u201d:</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-wants-an-unbiased-social-media-platform-he-should-have-the-government-make-one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-wants-an-unbiased-social-media-platform-he-should-have-the-government-make-one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The</url> post Republicans want to protect conservative voices, but they may end up destroying them appeared first on R Street.&lt;/p&gt;

Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons recounting several news reports that identified complaints about Google's anti-competitive conduct and privacy practices. </p><p>Alphabet shares were little changed after the release of the letter. The company declined to comment. Lawmakers from both major parties and Google's rivals have said this year they see an opening for increased regulation of large technology companies under the FTC's new slate of commissioners. Google's critics say that ongoing European antitrust action against the web search leader and this year's data privacy scandal involving Facebook Inc and political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica demonstrate their concerns about the unchecked power of the tech heavyweights. About 90 percent of search engine queries in the United States flow through Google. Facebook and Twitter executives are expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on September 5 about their efforts to deter foreign campaigns from spreading misinformation online ahead November's midterm elections. Lawmakers have criticized Alphabet for not scheduling a top executive, such as Chief Executive Larry Page, for the hearings. In 2013, the FTC closed a lengthy investigation of Google after finding insufficient evidence that consumers were harmed by how the company displayed search results from rivals. President Donald Trump accused Google's search engine on Tuesday of promoting negative news articles and hiding \"fair media\" coverage of him. Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later said the White House was \"taking a look\" at Google, and that the administration would do \"some investigation and some analysis,\" without providing further details. Earlier this year, Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat, and Representative Todd Rokita, a Republican, sent separate letters asking the FTC to probe Google. Simon, the new Republican chairman of the FTC, said in July the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. An FTC representative was not immediately available for comment. Hatch, at event hosted by reviews website and Google rival Yelp Inc in May, said moves made by \"an entrenched monopolist\" deserve extra skepticism. \"They may well be used, not to further consumer welfare, but to foreclose competitors,\" he said, according to prepared remarks. Yelp, a local-search service, said in a statement that Hatch's letter was \"heartening to see\" as it underscored the bipartisan plea for FTC scrutiny of Google. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121535663434618251766100125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T55-Y3V1-JB5Y-N3WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><timeReceived>9:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC000CY6C</classCode><className>YELP!

Greg Walden, R-Oregon, ranking Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued the following opening remarks at the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce hearing entitled \"Oversight of the Federal Trade Commission: Strengthening Protections for Americans' Privacy and Data Security\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with broad and important responsibilities and its jurisdiction spreads out over almost every aspect of the U.S. economy - from large, household-named technology companies in Silicon Valley to small mom-and-pop shops in rural America.</p><p>\"But, recently, concerns surrounding data security and data privacy, including questions about what information is collected, how companies use that information, who that information is shared with, and what protections exist for consumers, have demanded more Congressional attention.</p><p>\"Last Congress, this Committee held high profile hearings around incidents involving data security and data privacy issues with the CEOs of Equifax, Facebook, and Twitter. We also held hearings focused on: securing consumer information; understanding algorithmic decision making; exploring the online advertisement ecosystem and how it operates; and an oversight hearing with you, the FTC.</p><p>\"Privacy was a premiere issue during these hearings. But as we learned, this is a tough issue; privacy does not mean the exact same thing to every American.</p><p>\"I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague Rep. Rodgers who outlined the vast benefits consumers get from the use of their information online. We cannot lose sight of the tremendous benefits consumers get from the use of data - access to top-tier journalism, affordable and quickly delivered products, telehealth and research initiatives, and much more.</p><p>\"Here in the U.S., we have a thriving startup ecosystem and a regulatory environment that enables small businesses to grow and compete, in no small part because of the free flow of information. And, as a result, companies innovate, create new jobs, and offer consumers options and convenience.</p><p>\"I believe it is important that we work together toward a bipartisan federal privacy bill. And we are ready and willing to tackle crafting such a bill. I hope that we can continue down the bipartisan path together.</p><p>\"A federal privacy bill must set one national standard. Allowing a patchwork of state laws will not only hurt innovation and small businesses but will limit consumers options online. Consumers expect a seamless online experience, and I do not want to see that taken away.</p><p>\"We must protect innovation and small businesses. We should learn from Europe - where large companies are only getting larger and small companies are only getting smaller. JPMorgan Chase &amp;#38; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon recently said Dodd-Frank created a moat around his company - which is exactly what we risk doing with the likes of Google and Facebook if we do not carefully craft a national privacy bill.</p><p>\"We must enhance security for consumers. Companies must have reasonable practices in place to protect consumer information.</p><p>\"We must increase transparency - consumers deserve to know how their information is collected, used, and shared.</p><p>\"And we must improve accountability. When companies fail to keep their promises or outright misuse consumer information, those companies must be held accountable. This goes to the heart of the enforcement issues.</p><p>\"The FTC accomplishes its consumer protection mission through law enforcement - by bringing actions against companies who engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices; through advocacy; and through consumer and business education efforts. The FTC can file injunctions, levy civil penalties, and can seek remedies on behalf of consumers to redress their harms.</p><p>\"The FTC generally operates as a highly effective bipartisan agency. Returning millions directly to consumers after they are defrauded, and I look forward to hearing an update on those efforts. I also look forward to hearing about the consumer protection hearings and what the agency has learned about privacy harms and risks.</p><p>\"Every agency has challenges, and recent court cases have changed the direction of some agency activity to refocus on due process. I am encouraged that these types of improvements would help small businesses understand their rights when faced with the full force of the FTC.</p><p>\"I believe the FTC is the right agency to enforce a new privacy law with appropriate safeguards and process improvements to ensure strong, consistent enforcement. Some have suggested that the quick answer is more money, more rulemaking authority, and more employees. There is no quick fix. I would like to hear from the Chairman about his views on unbounded rulemaking for the FTC, and whether the agency can compete for talent with the big tech firms moving to the DC area. We must consider market realities and ask if there is a more effective way to get experts to the FTC for unique cases.</p><p>\"I look forward to hearing from you all about how you are thinking of using the current tools at the FTC to address privacy concerns in our digital world.</p><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6722926 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6722926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-8JS1-JC11-11GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Greg Walden, R-Oregon, ranking Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued the following opening remarks at the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology hearing entitled \"Legislating to Safeguard the Free and Open Internet\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>- Consumer Protection Online Should Apply to the Entire Internet Ecosystem</p><p>* * *</p><p>\"A permanent, legislative solution produced in good faith with our Democratic colleagues is the only way to protect consumers, innovation, and an open internet. I have repeatedly called for an end to this ridiculous, partisan back-and-forth. It's time for bipartisan legislation that can actually become law. Yet, even after offering a menu of bipartisan legislative proposals at our hearing last month to preserve an open internet once and for all, unfortunately our Democratic colleagues have once again refused to work with us on a bipartisan solution.</p><p>\"Their partisan approach is not the answer. Title II is not necessary to preserve a free and open internet. We can permanently address blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization without the harmful, heavy-handed approach of Title II.</p><p>\"We heard last month about the regulatory impact of Title II on rural broadband deployment from a small Internet Service Provider, Joe Franell of Eastern Oregon Telecom. In my district in eastern Oregon and across rural America, we rely on small ISPs like Eastern Oregon Telecom to help connect our communities with high-speed internet. In an op-ed in the East Oregonian this morning, Joe wrote that the heavy hand of Title II \"shifted Eastern Oregon Telecom's focus from our consumers to regulatory interference and the draining cost of reporting and compliance.\" Joe went on to say that every dollar he spends on reporting to regulatory agencies is a dollar not spend on serving rural Oregon.</p><p>\"Frankly, Title II could provide the federal government near unlimited and unchecked authority to regulate and tax the internet. That is not an internet that protects consumers nor does it allow for American ingenuity to thrive. We can do better.</p><p>\"I'd also like to note that the internet seems to be working today, despite all the hyperbolic rhetoric to the contrary last year. So what internet crisis brings us to the hearing room today? It's certainly not the abuses by the tech platforms that occupy the news everyday - not the limiting of conservative voices on social media, not the seeming inability to curb harmful and illicit behavior online, not how tech makes their deals to prioritize internet traffic, and not their own agreements on sharing of people's personal information. What brings us here is that Speaker Pelosi still believes broadband providers are the real threat, and so directed the majority to act on a bill that won't become law.</p><p>\"The internet of today grew dramatically with little or no government interference. Saddling it now with archaic regulation of the 1930s monopoly-era copper landline phone company seems like an odd way to spur investment and innovation. Meanwhile, Big Tech companies want complete freedom not just from regulation, but also from liability for facilitating all sorts of harmful and illicit activity.</p><p>\"Twenty years ago, a Republican Congress and a Democrat President granted special liability limitations to help the tech sector to flourish. This is Section 230 of the Telecom Act of 1996, and without question this bipartisan agreement accomplished its primary objective. Online platforms are now major venues for communication and commerce, and not just in the United States but around the world. But, Section 230 was also supposed to be about responsibility. With a liability limitation in their backpocket, we increasingly see the tech giants wield their power at the wrong targets.</p><p>\"When will this subcommittee seriously consider the role of the edge providers either as common carriers in the internet age, or how they are the ones with business models that use our data for their profits? If you're going to \"protect\" consumers online, should those online protections apply to the whole internet ecosystem?</p><p>\"Meanwhile, we should hear directly from the Federal Communications Commissioners about how this legislation will impact the vitality of the internet. I was under the impression that the majority planned to have the FCC up to testify in the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet. From a process standpoint and considering the need for the full Commission to weigh in on the impact of this proposal, Mr. Chairman will you commit to letting us have a hearing with the Commissioners before this measure is rushed to a markup?</p><p>\"I know Ms. Eshoo was quite vocal last summer when Republicans wanted to match our bipartisan success of enacting the FCC reauthorization with completing an NTIA reauthorization. Despite having had numerous hearings that included NTIA's Administrator as well as former Administrators and interested parties, there was still a demand by the Democrats to have Mr. Redl appear again following our legislative hearing. Can you assure me that the majority will hold itself to the same standard in this case?</p><p>\"With that, I yield back.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6646339 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6646339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMK-M071-DYG2-R1M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><timeReceived>7:44 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maxine Waters, D-California, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following opening statement on Feb. 11 at the semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins hearing on monetary policy and the state of the economy with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I discussed at our last hearing with you, I remain very concerned by the President's efforts to interfere with the Fed's independent monetary policy. A recent news story noted that Trump has tweeted over 100 times about the Fed since your nomination. Many of those tweets appear to be attempting to exert pressure on the Fed.</p><p>Chairman Powell, you and the Fed Board of Governors must not be swayed by these aggressive tactics. In upholding the Fed's independence, you should also be mindful of public perception.</p><p>Of course, Trump continues to try to claim credit for economic growth that was put in motion by the policies of President Obama, Congressional Democrats and the Federal Reserve. His irresponsible trade war and the GOP tax scam have blown up the national debt, slowed our economic growth, and harmed hardworking American families. Trump continues to squander this inherited economy.</p><p>Let me note that I am disappointed in the Fed's efforts to deregulate megabanks, most recently by proposing to further roll back the Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act made our financial system safer, but it depends on agencies like the Fed to prudently use the tools available to monitor and mitigate threats to our economy.</p><p>The Committee is carefully monitoring the developments in the repo market and the Fed's response. The Fed should not arbitrarily reduce liquidity requirements, in response to the repo market disruption, as some on Wall Street have asked for. Instead, the Fed should make appropriate adjustments to promote a well-functioning repo market while ensuring we have strong capital rules that can't be gamed through \"window dressing,\" a practice where banks alter their balance sheet to appear less risky and reduce their capital levels. In addition, the riskiness of various financial assets is increasing as climate change poses a more serious risk to our economy. The Fed and other regulators should utilize financial stability tools under Dodd-Frank, such as incorporating climate-related losses into supervisory stress tests of big banks, to address this growing risk.</p><p>I would also like to discuss recent developments involving the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). We've had a series of hearings on this issue, and I am very concerned about OCC Comptroller Otting's harmful proposal to turn CRA into the Community Disinvestment Act and allow banks to escape their obligation to make responsible investments in the communities where they are chartered.</p><p>I urge the Fed to take a careful, deliberate approach to any changes to the implementation of the CRA, and to not join Comptroller Otting's misguided efforts. Governor Brainard's statement that \"...it's more important to get the reforms done right than to do them quickly,\" is absolutely correct. The OCC and FDIC should heed that advice as well and extend the public comment period as community banks, state regulators, community and civil rights groups as well as Committee Democrats have called for so that all stakeholders have the opportunity to voice their concerns.</p><p>I also encourage the Fed to keep a watchful eye on Facebook's efforts to launch a cryptocurrency and digital wallet, which, as we discussed at our last hearing could have profound implications for monetary policy and compete with our own U.S. dollar. In light of the many risks Facebook's plans could create, I and other Democrats have called on Facebook to halt their plans until Congress can examine the issues associated with a big tech company developing these digital products, and take action.</p><p>I look forward to your testimony today Chairman Powell, and to discussing these matters.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7016675 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7016675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-4VR1-JC11-10TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>7:56 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maxine Waters, D-California, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following opening statement at a hearing entitled \"Examining Facebook's Proposed Cryptocurrency and Its Impact on Consumers, Investors and the American Financial System\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today we are here for a hearing on Facebook's proposed digital currency, Libra, and digital wallet, Calibra, and their impacts on consumers, investors and the financial system. Our first witness is David Marcus, Calibra's CEO. Following his testimony, a panel of experts will share their views on Facebook's plans.</p><p>\"I have serious concerns with Facebook's plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet and its efforts to enlist partners that expand its reach, like Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Uber, Lyft, and Spotify. Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar. This venture is slated to be based in Switzerland, which has a history as a monetary haven for criminals and shady corporations. Facebook's plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebook's over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy.</p><p>\"In addition, Facebook has proposed backing Libra tokens with government currencies and government guaranteed securities, and holding them in a so-called Libra Reserve, to be governed by Facebook and its partners. Ownership of government assets on such a massive scale without proper oversight threatens to concentrate government influence in the hands of a few elites. Ultimately, if Facebook's plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments.</p><p>\"Facebook's proposed entry into financial services is all the more troubling because it has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar to Wells Fargo, and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale similar to Equifax. Facebook remains under a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for deceiving consumers and failing to keep consumer data private. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook provided 50 million users' private data to a political consulting firm, the company will reportedly pay a record $5 billion fine to the FTC for data privacy failures. In addition, Facebook has allegedly: insecurely stored user passwords dating back to 2012; paid unsuspecting teenagers to download spyware; experienced a hack of nearly 50 million accounts; and experienced a software bug that granted third party access to 6.8 million users' photos. It has also been sued by HUD and civil rights groups for violations of the Fair Housing Act in what amounts to modern day redlining. Facebook also allowed malicious Russian state actors to purchase and target ads in a campaign to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>\"I am also concerned about the lack of diversity in Facebook's upper ranks, and fear that if these plans go forward, women and minorities and women- and minority-owned businesses may be excluded from participating fully.</p><p>\"In light of these and other concerns, my colleagues and I wrote to Facebook earlier this month to call on it to cease implementation of its plans until regulators and Congress can examine the issues associated with a large technology company developing a digital currency, and take action. The Independent Community Bankers of America and others support this commonsense step.</p><p>\"Facebook's plans also raise larger concerns about Big Tech's expansion into financial services, as it appears to inappropriately mix commerce and banking activities. So, today we will discuss a draft bill, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.</p><p>\"Today's hearing is only the first step in our oversight and legislative process. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6792969 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6792969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-2RV1-JC11-1361-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maxine Waters, D-California, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following opening statement at a full committee hearing entitled \"Examining Facebook's Proposed Cryptocurrency and Its Impact on Consumers, Investors and the American Financial System\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today we are here for a hearing on Facebook's proposed digital currency, Libra, and digital wallet, Calibra, and their impacts on consumers, investors and the financial system. Our first witness is David Marcus, Calibra's CEO. Following his testimony, a panel of experts will share their views on Facebook's plans.</p><p>\"I have serious concerns with Facebook's plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet and its efforts to enlist partners that expand its reach, like Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Uber, Lyft, and Spotify. Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar. This venture is slated to be based in Switzerland, which has a history as a monetary haven for criminals and shady corporations. Facebook's plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebook's over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy.</p><p>\"In addition, Facebook has proposed backing Libra tokens with government currencies and government guaranteed securities, and holding them in a so-called Libra Reserve, to be governed by Facebook and its partners. Ownership of government assets on such a massive scale without proper oversight threatens to concentrate government influence in the hands of a few elites. Ultimately, if Facebook's plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies and governments.</p><p>\"Facebook's proposed entry into financial services is all the more troubling because it has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar to Wells Fargo, and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale similar to Equifax. Facebook remains under a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for deceiving consumers and failing to keep consumer data private. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook provided 50 million users' private data to a political consulting firm, the company will reportedly pay a record $5 billion fine to the FTC for data privacy failures. In addition, Facebook has allegedly: insecurely stored user passwords dating back to 2012; paid unsuspecting teenagers to download spyware; experienced a hack of nearly 50 million accounts; and experienced a software bug that granted third party access to 6.8 million users' photos. It has also been sued by HUD and civil rights groups for violations of the Fair Housing Act in what amounts to modern day redlining. Facebook also allowed malicious Russian state actors to purchase and target ads in a campaign to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>\"I am also concerned about the lack of diversity in Facebook's upper ranks, and fear that if these plans go forward, women and minorities and women- and minority-owned businesses may be excluded from participating fully.</p><p>\"In light of these and other concerns, my colleagues and I wrote to Facebook earlier this month to call on it to cease implementation of its plans until regulators and Congress can examine the issues associated with a large technology company developing a digital currency, and take action. The Independent Community Bankers of America and others support this commonsense step.</p><p>\"Facebook's plans also raise larger concerns about Big Tech's expansion into financial services, as it appears to inappropriately mix commerce and banking activities. So, today we will discuss a draft bill, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prevent large platform utilities like Facebook from becoming financial institutions and block them from creating their own currencies.</p><p>\"Today's hearing is only the first step in our oversight and legislative process. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6794452 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6794452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-W8C1-JC11-11RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maxine Waters, D-California, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following opening statement at the full committee hearing entitled \"Promoting Financial Stability? Reviewing the Administration's Deregulatory Approach to Financial Stability\":</p><p>\"Today we are here to discuss the Trump Administration's actions that have undermined, and not promoted, our nation's financial stability.</p><p>\"As I have said many times before, I am very concerned about this Administration's actions to eliminate important protections for consumers, investors and our economy. It appears that our banking regulators are following the deregulatory blueprint that the Treasury Department under Secretary Mnuchin's leadership has mapped out point by point, and rolling back many of the critical reforms Democrats made to prevent another financial crisis. If these rollbacks continue, there will be grave consequences for financial stability and our economy.</p><p>\"The 2008 financial crisis was devastating for our nation. 11 million Americans lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth was lost, and nearly 9 million Americans lost their jobs. As Chairwoman of this Committee, I am committed to doing everything that I can to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past as I've now seen twice how the road of deregulation leads to financial crises.</p><p>\"The focus of this hearing is the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC. We created FSOC as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to eliminate regulatory gaps and to ensure the government could identify and mitigate risks to our economy.</p><p>\"After the financial crisis, FSOC designated several large nonbank financial companies for enhanced oversight, including AIG, the well-known poster child for the financial crisis. Under the Trump Administration, however, FSOC ceased supervision of all of these nonbanks, and advanced an activities-based approach that amounts to more deregulation, willfully ignoring how catastrophic the failure of a large financial institution would be for the financial system and economy.</p><p>\"The Trump Administration has also cut FSOC's budget and reduced its staff by half. It has also reduced the budget and staff of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), which collects data and conducts research and analysis to aid FSOC in its important work. Along the way, the Trump Administration has fleeced American taxpayers with their tax scam, which contained more big giveaways to the nation's largest banks.</p><p>\"All of these steps put Wall Street's bottom line first and Main Street back at risk. And make no mistake, the risks are growing. Climate change, cybersecurity, leveraged lending, hedge funds, and the rapid emergence of big tech in the financial system led by Facebook are all concerns that must be taken seriously.</p><p>\"Today, Secretary Mnuchin will once again be asked to explain the harmful actions of the Trump Administration to the American public.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6949480 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6949480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNX-FGK1-DYG2-R0MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"503\"/><timeReceived>10:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, issued the following statement on the House vote on the Save the Internet Act:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The internet isn't broken, so why are liberals trying to fix it? In this legislation, House Democrats want to give federal entities nearly unlimited authority to regulate the internet, which is why I voted against it.</p><p>\"I support the bipartisan and commonsense 'bright line' rules for net neutrality - no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization - that protect consumers, but the Save the Internet Act reaches far beyond these commonsense protections. In rural districts like mine, this bill would slow down or reduce network expansion, a critical delay as I fight to expand broadband connectivity in remote areas.</p><p>\"This isn't even the first time we've had a net neutrality debate. When President Trump first announced he was repealing regulations, liberals would not stop talking about how this would radically change the internet as we knew it. But when the regulations ceased, these doomsday predictions fell flat. Life continued uninterrupted, and Americans enjoyed affordable and reliable internet access.</p><p>\"This so-called attempt to 'save the internet' has nothing to do with better internet service; it's a gift to edge providers who want to market personal data. GOP members have introduced at least three bills that would protect consumers without overbearing government involvement - let's focus our attention on those practical solutions instead.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background:</p><p>The Save the Internet Act would:</p><p>Allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to set prices, sanction investments and dictate how broadband companies interact with their customers.</p><p>Lay the groundwork for taxing and overregulating the internet.</p><p>Require FCC approval for development of new 5G and other innovative technologies, which would discourage, delay or block them altogether.</p><p>Limit access for rural Americans. Studies show that 80 percent of providers in rural areas incurred additional expenses when complying with the Obama-era net neutrality regulations, which led to delayed or reduced network expansion.</p><p>Allow big tech corporations like Facebook and Google to undermine American families' privacy.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6690542 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6690542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVS-S7S1-JC11-13N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

amendment to the country's securities law that also aims to better protect investors and prevent insider trading.</p><p>Mainland authorities have recently stepped up moves to attract listings of big tech firms, including launching a new technology board in Shanghai in July, as the country's economy has stuttered to its slowest rate of growth since the early 1990's.</p><p>\"This amendment is a big

It is expected to include proposals for sweeping controls over tech companies' handling of personal data and their use of \"opaque\" algorithms to rank how they display advertisements, search results and content. In a 328-page preliminary report issued in December, the ACCC had raised alarm over the \"substantial\" market power wielded by the likes of Google and Facebook, and notably the \"lack of transparency\" in their operations.</p><p> \"We are at a critical point in considering the impact of digital platforms on society,\" said the report, initiated by the conservative government at the behest of Australia's main media organisations. The report focused particular attention on the huge impact Google and Facebook have had on Australia's news industry, with the number of newspaper and online journalists falling more than 20% since 2014 as digital advertising revenues were overwhelmingly captured by the two tech titans.</p><p> \"While the ACCC recognises their significant benefits to consumers and businesses, there are important questions to be asked about the role the global digital platforms play in the supply of news and journalism in Australia,\" it said. A set of preliminary proposals set out in the report, many of which are expected to figure in the final conclusions, include greater regulation over the handling of personal data, similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced last year.</p><p> It also called for new penalties for invasion of privacy and greater controls on merger and acquisition activity by the biggest digital firms. - Growing power of Big Tech - One of its most radical suggestions is the creation of an Algorithm Review Board to monitor the complex formulae used to deliver advertisements, and rank news content and referral services to news media.</p><p> The ACCC said such a regulator was needed to ensure the big digital players do not \"favour their own business interests, through their market power and presence across multiple markets\". \"There are also issues with the role of digital platforms in determining what news and information is accessed by Australians, how this information is provided, and its range and reliability.</p><p>\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims has said regulatory authorities in the United States, Britain, Europe and other areas are closely monitoring the outcome of the Australian inquiry as they all mull possible responses to the growing power of tech titans. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has already taken controversial steps targeting Big Tech, including introducing criminal penalties for executives of social media companies which permit the distribution of violent content on their platforms and an unprecedented law forcing tech firms to help security services break encrypted communications.</p><p> Tech companies have warned that enacting many of the ACCC's proposed recommendations would be impractical, or lead firms to simply avoid doing business in Australia. \"We obviously need really clear rules for the internet that protect privacy, safety, the economic and social benefits of technology while also protecting competition and innovation,\" said Sunita Bose, head of the DIGI lobbying group formed by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other firms to deal with Australian regulators.</p><p> But, in an interview with Nine media newspapers ahead of the ACCC release, Bose cautioned that some of the watchdog's recommendations, on top of the government's earlier measures, could not only hurt the big players but have an even greater impact on start-ups and smaller firms with limited resources to meet new regulatory demands. She warned in particular against attempts to monitor and regulate algorithms, which she said \"constitute highly sensitive commercial information\".</p><p> \"The prospect of having to disclose such sensitive information will serve as a deterrent to global digital companies and start-ups initiating or expanding their operations in Australia,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG23062019035852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-6NJ1-F00C-64NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 23, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
