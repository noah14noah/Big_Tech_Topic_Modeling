But as the big tech platforms brace for 2018, their business models that have been so disruptive to everybody else are now under siege from regulators and politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The halo effect has been shattered.</p><p>Eric Goldman, a former Silicon Valley lawyer turned tech policy academic, says the pendulum has swung hard against the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"For a long time the internet community was viewed as a saviour or part of the solution, whereas now they're seen as the enemy or the problem,\" he says.</p><p>Facebook's peddling of \"fake news\" produced by Russian operatives during last year's US election, a record (EURO)2.4 billion ($3.7 billion) fine against Google for abusing its dominance in search, growing concerns in Washington about big tech wielding outsized influence on society and Amazon's demolition of brick and mortar retailers have collided to make it a fertile time to attack the world's largest companies.</p><p>In Australia, the competition regulator has opened an unprecedented inquiry into Google and Facebook's impact on competition in media and advertising markets.</p><p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also taken aim at Apple for not co-operating more with law enforcement authorities on decrypting data belonging to criminal suspects such as terrorists.</p><p>Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya stunned the tech community in December when he admitted to feeling guilty about social media \"destroying how society works\". Palihapitiya later partially walked back his critique, saying Facebook was a \"force for good in the world\" and that he really meant to start \"an important conversation\".</p><p>Prominent economist Kenneth Rogoff goes as far as to suggest that the tech firms are hurting competition in the economy because of their oligopoly-like power.</p><p>\"They're anti-innovation,\" he says. \"Any little innovative company, they buy it up.\"</p><p>In Rogoff's mind this ability to take over any emerging competitive threat interferes with the creative destruction of capitalism. Even media mogul Rupert Murdoch sold the bulk of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets because of the competitive threat from Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Google in streaming content to viewers.</p><p>The world appears to have experienced similar phenomena in the past. The coveted front page of Forbes magazine a decade ago featured an image of Nokia chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo using one of the Finnish company's flip phones. \"Nokia. One billion customers - can anyone catch the cell phone king?\" posed the headline. The Nokia mobile phone was eclipsed by Apple's iPhone very soon after that question was posed. Nokia's share price today is about (EURO)4, crashing from a peak of (EURO)63 in 2000.</p><p>In the 1980s and '90s the US government wanted to regulate IBM and Microsoft as monopolies, just as a new breed of technology disrupters were emerging to take their crowns.</p><p>Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, says regulators need to be careful not to prematurely intervene in the market: \"Facebook's and Google's dominance is not going to be sustainable over a longer period of time.\"</p><p>Which brings us to the question many are asking: Could this time be different because the big tech firms control so much valuable data on their users that the barriers to entry for competitors are much higher than in the past?</p><p>\"You don't get to be a major, major global success without hurting competitors,\" says Rob Atkinson, president of the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think-tank.</p><p>\"The people hurt by that support the narrative and cast aspersions on them to get a commercial leg up on lobbying positions in Washington.\"</p><p>Indeed, Murdoch's News Corporation publications, including The Australian and The Wall Street Journal, have given front page space to the failures of big tech. Google and Facebook have sucked away millions in advertising revenue from News and Fairfax Media, publisher of AFR Weekend.</p><p>Their data and algorithms are so precise in targeting consumers, that Google and Facebook collect about 84 per cent of international digital advertising revenue, media buying agency GroupM estimates.</p><p>Belatedly perhaps, big tech has seen the writing on the wall and is trying to spruce up its image to keep heavy-handed regulators at bay. Facebook is tweaking its controversial international tax structure by announcing it will no longer book some digital advertising sales through its low-tax Irish subsidiary.</p><p>Google is entering into revenue-sharing and data-sharing agreements with traditional media publishers, such as Fairfax, News Corp, the Financial Times and The New York Times. In theory such deals should direct more advertising, and as a result more ad dollars, to these publishers.</p><p>Facebook is setting up new transparency tools to check who is really behind advertisements, in response to the outcry about Russia manipulating the social media platform to boost Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton during the election.</p><p>The ITIF's Atkinson says tech companies should have done a better job earlier to take preventive steps. \"If they don't fix the problem, they're in big, big trouble.\"</p><p>But he foresees a new emerging backlash against tech disrupters that may unite blue and white collar workers alike against big tech: the automation of jobs.</p><p>\"Automation and jobs is going to continue to challenge the tech industry,\" Atkinson says. \"They're really disruptive and I don't think the industry had done a good job of pushing back against these narratives.\"P</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6y5eip1d89t5daoxjj2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8B-N6G1-JD34-V02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p> Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>Facebook</p><p> With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p> Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea.</p><p> Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook also has stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p> New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Google</p><p> As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p> Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p> It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p> But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Apple</p><p> Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p> If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p> App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy.</p><p> Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p> Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.<br/>Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.<br/> Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.<br/>FACEBOOK<br/> With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?<br/> Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea.<br/> Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.<br/>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability.<br/>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.<br/> New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.<br/> Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.<br/>GOOGLE<br/> As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.<br/> Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.<br/>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.<br/> It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.<br/>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.<br/> But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.<br/> Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.<br/>APPLE<br/> Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.<br/> If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.<br/> App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.<br/>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.<br/> Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.<br/>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.<br/> Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.<br/>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"<br/>AMAZON<br/> From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.<br/> The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.<br/> Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.<br/> When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"<br/>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90 percent of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"<br/> But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52 percent of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48 percent last year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMAN-n11031393</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8R-GT61-JBYT-H1VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Manufacturing News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defences could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice-President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 per cent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 per cent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New York;

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defences could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice-President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 per cent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 per cent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New York;

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defences could be.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech, as has Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Former Vice-President Joe Biden has said that he is open to the idea .</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Warren, however, has laid out plans for legislation that targets companies with more than $25 billion of annual revenue. It would limit their ability to expand and force parts of their business to operate as separate entities.</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might simply argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 per cent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 per cent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>When Warren tweeted in April that big tech companies like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back: \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a similar case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p><p>_____</p><p>Associated Press writers Mae Anderson in New York;

Experts say breakups are unlikely in the short term, and Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on the investigations.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defences could be.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion (U.S.) in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it an illegal, competition-crushing monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are already investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be tough to break up the business.</p><p>Google</p><p>As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals at all - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>Apple</p><p>Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the Justice Department is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Amazon</p><p>From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting an early-stage probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.</p><p>Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos made a case in a recent letter to shareholders: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019072755182635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNK-5YR1-DY91-K3XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 27, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power. </p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be. </p><p>Facebook: With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it a  monopoly? </p><p>Federal regulators are  investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram.  </p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example. </p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. </p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google. </p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google. </p><p>Google: As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit. </p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently. </p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>It's Google's technology and Google can use it as it wishes, goes one line of reasoning. </p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system. </p><p>But Google might  argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones. </p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said. </p><p>Apple: Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the DOJ is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed. </p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser. </p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Apple says the commissions cover costs for running the app store, including hiring people to review apps. </p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use. </p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives likened a breakup to \"a complex and almost impossible Siamese twin operation.\"</p><p>Amazon: From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries. </p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting a probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services. </p><p>Cicilline, the congressman, said Amazon has identified bestselling products elsewhere, rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products over those of its rivals.In a recent letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos took issue with allegations of the dominance: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\" </p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0096204351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9K-0TT1-JBM5-R01B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

This is one of those times. Several US politicians, most loudly presidential wannabe Elizabeth Warren, are calling for the break-up of \"Big Tech\". If they have their way, British consumers and businesses will share with their American counterparts both the benefits, if any, and the costs, if any, of a radical restructuring of a large sector of the economy - one that has changed the way we communicate, get news, shop, do research and live our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The call for the break-up of Facebook, Google (for convenience, I use that designation rather than its parent Alphabet), Amazon and perhaps others goes far beyond what competition enforcers in the EU and in Britain have been doing - fines and forcing an end to certain practices, but leaving the structures of the companies untouched.</p><p>The challenge is serious, more so because it is part of a basic rethinking of competition law, dominated for decades by the so-called Chicago School led by my former colleague Bob Bork: in brief, no consumer harm, mostly in the form of higher prices, equals no antitrust problem. Companies giving away their services (Google, Facebook), or driving prices down (Amazon), could not possibly be violating the law. They are the consumers' friends.</p><p>Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who chairs the House antitrust sub-committee, is not so sure. He has issued a sweeping demand for Big Tech company documents, and will soon hold hearings. His counsel, Lina Khan, triggered the policy rethink when at Yale Law School. The attackers also include the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the attorneysgeneral of 48 states, plus Puerto Rico and DC (California, home to many of these companies, and Alabama have abstained), and assorted academics.</p><p>Their targets are relying on their mere size being no offence under existing competition law. So long as they can show their size results from superior efficiency and skill - from building the proverbial better mousetrap - it will be difficult for even the most skilled lawyers to persuade a judge to follow the lead of a court that, in 1984, ordered the dismemberment of communications giant AT&amp;T. Big Tech has two problems in relying on that defence. The first is that they grew largely by acquiring other companies. Amazon has bought or invested in at least 128 companies in the past 20 years, and its appetite seems undiminished. Facebook grew by snapping up 79 companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Google has more than 200 acquisitions under its belt, including YouTube, Nest Labs and DoubleClick. In this era of newly revived antitrust enforcement, many of these deals might have been turned down by regulators because they harmed competition, real or potential. The approval of those deals is now being reviewed by the authorities.</p><p>Big Tech's second problem is posed by some of its business practices, which may have contributed more to the companies' growth than the construction of better mousetraps. Amazon's use of own-brand merchandise to compete with vendors that use its distribution system is causing concern, and announcing a plan to enter the meal-kit market sent shares plummeting in rival Blue Apron.</p><p>\"Amazon Meal Kits\" are now displayed prominently in Whole Foods, acquired by Amazon for $13.7bn ((EURO)12.2bn) in cash in 2017. Google, which has what regulators consider a dominant share of the search market, allegedly uses that power to promote its own maps and other products over those of small competitors. Facebook's promises of reform remain just that, and its lack of competition has prevented users from switching to other platforms in protest. Or so its critics claim.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a move that is either courageous or reckless, Google has presented itself as a test case of the new, reinvigorated competition policy by buying Fitbit for $2.1bn, pending regulatory approval. The price is no problem - it comes to less than 2% of the company's net cash balance - and Google also accounts for 37.2% of all digital advertising spending, according to the research firm eMarketer.</p><p>Google says it will not use the health data available from Fitbit's 28m active users to target its ads better and so increase its market share. Regulators will want more than mere promises.</p><p>This is not the place to consider whether competition from other advertising outlets or emerging competitors (among them Amazon) is sufficiently intense to make digital dominance by Google and Facebook irrelevant. Lots of lawyers and economic consultants, not to mention lobbyists for both companies, will be comfortably retired before that issue is decided.</p><p>Which brings us back to the EU approach - order an end to anticompetitive practices, levy fines, but do not break up these companies. An alternative remedy is forced restructuring - break-up in some form.</p><p>Amazon might be required to make its infrastructure widely available and to cease selling own-brand products in competition with small companies that sell via Amazon. Google might be required to spin off products and services that compete with independent providers. And Facebook might be forced to divest companies it should never have been allowed to acquire in the first place.</p><p>Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg told his staff that he will fight efforts to break up his company and \"we will win\".

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power. </p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be. </p><p>Facebook: With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it a monopoly? </p><p>Federal regulators are  investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram.  </p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer - as it's done with Snapchat, for example. </p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. </p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google. </p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google. </p><p>Google: As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit. </p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently. </p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals - an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies. </p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system. </p><p>But Google might  argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones. </p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said. </p><p>Apple: Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps. </p><p>If it opens an investigation, the DOJ is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed. </p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser. </p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use. </p><p>Amazon: From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries. </p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting a probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services. </p><p>In a recent letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos took issue with allegations of the dominance: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\" </p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0096339651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB6-XFB1-JBM5-R31S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the subcommittee pursuing the House investigation, called such measures a \"last resort.\" But even without that, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple could face new restrictions on their power.</p><p>Here's a look at the cases that could be brought against them and what their defenses could be.</p><p>Facebook: With 2.4 billion users, $56 billion in revenue last year and a name that's synonymous with social media, Facebook is certainly big. But is it a monopoly?</p><p>Federal regulators are investigating the company's privacy practices. But the antitrust question has been rumbling in the background, with critics calling for spinning off WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Critics believe a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer -- as it's done with Snapchat, for example.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation, though nothing that comes close to breaking it up. In a recent statement, the company's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook \"accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for \"new rules\" in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>Facebook has also stressed that it has competitors in messaging and digital communication, including Apple and Google.</p><p>New York University law professor Eleanor Fox said that because antitrust law focuses on companies that raise prices too much, and Facebook is free, it will be a tough to break up the business. And Facebook commands less than a quarter of worldwide digital advertising, well behind Google.</p><p>Google: As Google becomes a leading mail provider, search engine and advertising platform, federal regulators are starting to wonder if it needs to be knocked down a bit.</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals -- notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently.</p><p>Google might argue it doesn't have an obligation to do business with its rivals -- an argument that other companies have made when faced with similar challenges, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates breaking up monopolies.</p><p>Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices it uses to get its search and other products featured on smartphones. Some say Google imposes too many self-serving regulations on smartphone makers who use Google's Android operating system.</p><p>But Google might argue that Android users like Google products and want them on their phones.</p><p>Under existing laws, it is difficult to make the case that Google has monopoly power, \"even though I think a lot of people think it's really obvious,\" Fox said.</p><p>Apple: Since its opening in 2008, Apple's pioneering app store has given customers instant access to services that entertain, enlighten and engage. But it's also a place where Apple controls all the access and sets commission rates for subscriptions and other purchases made through the apps.</p><p>If it opens an investigation, the DOJ is most likely to focus on whether Apple is abusing its veto and pricing power to throttle and gouge its competition. The commissions it collects are also the subject of a consumer lawsuit that the Supreme Court recently cleared to proceed.</p><p>App makers periodically allege that they are blocked because Apple wants people to use its own services. In a recent example, several makers of apps for managing the amount of time kids can use their iPhones say they were kicked out of the store not long after Apple introduced its own screen-management controls.</p><p>Apple says it typically blocks only apps with buggy software or features that invade users' privacy. The company likens its rules to merchants deciding what products to carry. Apple also says its store includes apps that compete with its own products, including Google Maps and Google's Chrome browser.</p><p>Also under criticism is the 30 percent cut that Apple pockets on new subscription sign-ups during the first year and a 15 percent slice for renewals. The app store is expected to generate about $16 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Antitrust regulators could try to impose requirements that lower Apple's commissions or, in a worst-case scenario, force it to spin off the app store. The latter option, though, could hurt consumers by making iPhones and other Apple products more cumbersome to use.</p><p>Amazon: From an online bookseller, Amazon has grown into a gigantic e-commerce player with its tentacles in everything from web hosting to streaming video to groceries.</p><p>The European Union's antitrust chief has been conducting a probe into whether Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. Italy has been looking into whether Amazon abused its dominance by offering preferential treatment to companies that used Amazon's own delivery-management services.</p><p>In a recent letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos took issue with allegations of the dominance: \"Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that's largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores.\"</p><p>But Amazon does dominate online. Market research company eMarketer expects Amazon to account for 52% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, up from 48% last year. ct19 0035 190608 N S 0000000000 00003463</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: (Facebook logo) RICHARD DREW/AP<br/>Photo: (Google logo) JEFF CHIU/AP<br/>Photo: (Apple logo) HECTOR RETAMAL/GETTY-AFP<br/>Photo: (Amazon logo) DENIS CHARLET/GETTY-AFP</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo(s)6325</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-190606391839930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8X-TP41-JBG7-43TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chicago Tribune Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There is a reason why everyone turns to big tech during downturns. At the beginning of the year, these companies combined made about 11% of the value of the U.S. stock market. Their share's swelled to 17% by the end of May. </p><p>This is not really a surprise as these stocks have been S&amp;#38;P 500's outperformers since 2015. It all just got much more dramatic in 2020. Since the beginning of the year, Amazon is up nearly 37%.If we look at Facebook alone, and specifically between March 23rd and June 8th, its stock grew more than 56%. Since the Great Financial Crisis, the growth of the largest companies has been nothing less than staggering. But that doesn't mean it will continue indefinitely.The Mighty Have Fallen BeforeAt the end of 2013, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM[6]) comprised 2.7% of the S&amp;#38;P 500. With oil at its death bed, this has now shrunk to 0.87%. In 2018, the shrinking stock price of the giant General Electric Company (NYSE: GE[7]) caused it to be delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Its fall began during the 2008 crisis when it started cutting on dividends. It is all just a confirmation that the future is promised to no oneand even big tech has an Achilles heel.Facebook - Legal IssuesNot all financial problems come from harmed top lines. Regulatory pressures pose a serious threat as well. With the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook's stock tumbled. Yet, when its CEO testified in front of Congress, shares rose nearly 5% so the market's reaction is difficult to forecast. But the way Zuckerberg approached the latest controversy when he defended the platform's hands-off policy towards posts that promoted violence and contained misinformation was severely judged by many. Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR[8]) and Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP[9]) took a stand against President Trump's aggressive posts. And some advertisers took a timeout from Facebook due to the morally unacceptable behavior. And considering the platform generates 98% of its revenuefrom ads, this attitude couldresult in painful consequences.Amazon - Poor Employee ManagementBack in March, Amazon had to deal with an action antitrust lawsuit regarding allegedprice-fixing. But more importantly, the pandemic has forced the e-commerce giant to focus on its employees in the same way it centers its business around its consumers. Amazon's market value might have skyrocketed during the pandemic, but it has also put more light on its weak spots, such as labor policies. If its workforce doesn't feel safe, protected, and appreciated, there cannot be any long-term success.Google - Regulatory PressuresThe Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is moving forward with an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet as early as this summer. Like Facebook, Google had its fair share of controversy.Microsoft - Forced To Rethink Its ActionsEven the clear skies of Microsoft receivedsome clouds due to the tragic passing ofGeorge Floyd.The company is being urged to follow the footsteps of Amazon and IBM (NYSE: IBM[10]). The tech giant has vocally supported the black community, but not with action. What it needs to do is alter what it sells to police agencies. By 'what', we mean 'facial recognition' which has caused various racial issues. Research from 2019 showed that for some algorithms, African American and Asian people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white males. OneZero also reported Microsoft's own employees have been calling on the tech company to stop working with police and many are calling for a total ban on the tech across the U.S.Apple - Lack Of InnovationLet's face it: Apple didn't bring anything new to the table, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. To diversify its risk, the company has been shifting away from hardware to a service-based business model and it's doing it quite well. But this also entails its ecosystem is overlapping with midcaps such as the Chinese TENCENT HOLDING/ADR (OTCPK: TCEHY[11]) whose portfolio also contains music, gaming, and video streaming. The most recent issue is a hardware fault with no other than the star itself, the iPhone. So, despite having the abundant cash flow to go through more than one storm, the pressure on Apple is surely rising.Outlook - Emphasis On Human Values Will Be The JudgeAs COVID-19 swept the globe, it took many lives and threatened even more. A paused global economy was unthinkable just three months ago, yet it happened. But there are issues which have long been ignored throughout human history and it is no invisible enemy but something we can influence. And even big tech will suffer with all its success if it chooses to turn its back on human values.

In some regards, it\u2019s not surprising, considering the incredible accommodative stance from global Central bankers.</p><p>Beneath the surface of the stock market indices lies a somewhat concerning trend of five companies: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook, which represent almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> Such a large concentration of a few companies pushing the stock market higher has usually led to tears. Let me explain, why.</p><p> The S&amp;P 500 index is capitalization-weighted by its constituents. As one company appreciates, their weighting in the index then rises. Microsoft has the largest capitalization of any company, at $1.6 trillion. That is, all of their 7.6 billion outstanding shares, multiplied by the current share price of $211, is worth $1.6 trillion. This represents 6% of the entire index. If Microsoft appreciates 1% in a single day, the contribution to the total index return is 0.06%. However, if McDonald\u2019s, which represents only 0.5% of the index with a total market cap of $136 billion, rises 1%, its contribution to the return is 0.005%, or less than one-tenth that of Microsoft.</p><p> As illustrated in the example above, if five companies represent almost 20% of the broad stock market, investors need to own these companies in similar weightings if they hope to \u201ckeep up\u201d with the market.</p><p> Growth investors may need to be even more careful.</p><p> The same five companies in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF represent over 37% of the fund! Investors are usually very cautious about having 5% of their portfolio in a single stock. In many of the growth indices, Microsoft represents 10%, Apple 9.7%, and Amazon 8%!</p><p> The party may end soon.</p><p> For several years, technology giants have been probed by regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad. Lately, the pressure seems to be increasing.</p><p> There are always two sides to the story, however, and it is easy to articulate why these companies should be in your portfolio. But also, be mindful of industry and stock concentration and look to reduce outsized positions.</p><p> Beese Fulmer Private Wealth Management was founded in 1980 and is one of Stark County\u2019s oldest and largest investment management firms. The company serves high-net-worth individuals, families, and non-profits, and has been ranked as one of the largest money managers in Northeast Ohio.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REPTRY-4282190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REPTRY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BM-2B81-DXVP-V1D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387651</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"396\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a presidential contender, says companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google have too much power over our economy, society, and democracy. President Trump has said that \"something is going on in terms of monopoly,\" and it's \"a bad situation.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many Americans agree with them. They worry about the volume of personal data the tech giants possess and the sway these companies have over their lives. Facebook has 2.4 billion active monthly users. Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce spending in America. Google gets more than 92 percent of global search engine inquiries. Apple became the first company to cross the $1 trillion mark in market capitalizationa market cap larger than the GDP of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The government is upping its scrutiny of Big Tech, which is facing sweeping antitrust investigations by the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and Congress. New laws could be coming too: Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced a bill dubbed the Monopolization Deterrence Act, which would impose harsher penalties on Big Tech companies that engage in anticompetitive practices.</p><p>And perhaps feeling this pressure, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in an audio clip that was leaked in early October, can be heard blasting Warren's plan to break up Big Tech companies if she's elected president. \"I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\" Zuckerberg says in a speech to Facebook employees. \"It's like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.</p><p>But is it a good idea, or even possible, to split up these companies? We asked five Questrom School of Business professors about the questionseconomic, political, and customer-relatedwe need to consider before rethinking our regulation of Big Tech.</p><p>A breakup might not be legal</p><p>Back in the 1880s, many companies in the United States were growing into monopolies, using anticompetitive, oppressive business practices. As a result, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, and the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914, outlawing monopolies, cartels, and trustsand they started picking the biggest offenders apart. The American Tobacco Company was broken up into four different firms. Standard Oil became 34 separate companies.</p><p>Those broadly worded statutes still hold up more than a century later, says antitrust expert Michael Salinger, Jacqueline and Arthur Bahr Professor of Markets, Public Policy, and Law.</p><p>\"These acts were passed before we had radio, telephones, televisionand yet, the principle that it should be illegal to monopolize a market through means other than providing a better product at a better price still holds true.\"</p><p>But before we start smashing modern monopolies, we need to figure out if they've actually broken long-established antitrust laws, says Salinger, markets, public policy, and law department chair. \"These companies need to have violated laws in ways in which an appropriate remedy would be to break them up. We can't just do it because some politicians think it'd be a good idea,\" he says.</p><p>If we start breaking up companies wantonly, that's going to hurt innovation.</p><p>Garrett Johnson, assistant professor of marketing</p><p>That caution is echoed by Garrett Johnson, an assistant professor of marketing: \"It's frustrating that the conversation tends to go along the lines of, 'These companies are doing bad things, so we want to hurt them by breaking them up.' If we start breaking up companies wantonly, that's going to hurt innovation.\"</p><p>As to whether these companies have violated antitrust laws, Salinger isn't so sure they have.</p><p>\"You have to ask how they got the market position they have,\" he says. \"You're only guilty of monopolization if you've attained your monopoly by means other than providing a better product at a better price. Look at Google. People want to search on Google. Their search yields useful information and it's free, so it's no wonder they've got such a strong position in the market.\"</p><p>One solution would be to stop companies getting too big in the first place. Timothy Simcoe, an associate professor of strategy and innovation, believes we should pay more attention to Big Tech mergers before they happen. Take Facebook and its acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>\"I don't know that those mergers got a particularly hard lookand maybe they should have,\" Simcoe says. That said, he doesn't think predicting which mergers will turn a company into a monopoly will be a simple task. \"Of course, that's easy to say and hard to do. Often, these technologies are nascent when acquisitions are proposed,\" he says. He suggests tightening up merger reviews by giving more resources to antitrust agencies, and not placing a presumption of efficiency on every vertical merger.</p><p>Blurry boundaries</p><p>One of the main purposes of antitrust laws is to protect competition and the market. According to Kabrina Chang (CAS'92), a clinical associate professor of markets, public policy, and law, the first step in determining whether a company has a monopoly is defining its marketsomething that might not be so easy to do with modern tech giants. \"I don't know what the market is with Amazon,\" she says. Jokingly referring to Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017, she asks, \"Is it groceries now?\"</p><p>\"What does it mean when Amazon enters healthcare or groceries, or Google enters self-driving cars?\" says Marshall Van Alstyne, Questrom Professor in Management and coauthor of Platform Revolution: How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy and How to Make Them Work for You. \"These are market adjacenciesand you want to be able to bring in high quality and innovation to adjacent industries, but you might still be relying on the market power of a firm that's incumbent in a narrower industry. The boundaries are getting very challenging to define.\"</p><p>One answer to the problem of blurry boundaries is to isolate what economists call a bottleneck resourcewhat gives a company its monopoly power.</p><p>\"What are the joints along which you carve to get the benefits you're hoping to get by breaking up these companies?\" asks Simcoe. \"Some economists suggest preventing monopoly providers from entering other industries, so for example, allowing Google to continue in search, but barring it from adjacent markets, like getting involved in airline reservations.</p><p>\"If you can identify the bottleneck resource that gives them monopoly power, put that in a separate organization with a 'must-deal-with-everyone' sort of requirement, then you spin off all the unrelated businesses into a different unit.\"</p><p>Although Amazon has a market cap of more than $900 billion, CEO Jeff Bezos and the company insist it is not a monopoly.

Illustration by Lee Caulfield</p><p>Our data isn't gold</p><p>Something else that may give us pause before breaking up tech companies is how much we've come to rely on them. Google and Facebook have become integrated into our daily lives: the average person conducts three to four Google searches and spends 35 minutes on Facebook every day. We may be uneasy with the power of tech companies, but most of us willingly sign away our rights to get access to a service. How many times have you blindly accepted online terms and conditions?</p><p>Perhaps one of the reasons we're so distrusting of Big Tech, Chang says, is the amount of power we've let these companies accumulateover us, our data, and our democracy.</p><p>\"They have immense power, and they've got immense influence in public discourse. There have even been Supreme Court cases that ruled that since social media is so important, it's unconstitutional to prohibit people from using Facebook. It really is a modern public square,\" she says.</p><p>Warren has argued that her plan to break up Big Tech would \"give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold\" and restrict the advantages analyzing our data gives bigger, more established firms. But our data might not be the cash cow we think it is. There's no doubt Big Tech companies make buckets of money from using our data, especially for advertising purposesin 2018, Amazon's ad business surpassed $10 billion and Google's ad sales totaled $116 billionbut, says Johnson, \"These high dollar amounts have caused some people to think that their data is a huge pot of gold being stolen from them by these evil companies. That's really an overstatement of what's going on.\"</p><p>For example, on a per-consumer basis, Facebook's global average revenue per user hovers around $25 a yearcapping how much your data is actually worth. \"With over two billion users, collectively, each of our $25 helps fund all of the free internet services we enjoy [from Facebook]. This notion that we are being robbed of our high-value data is really overstated, and I think that's crucial to understand,\" says Johnson.</p><p>Van Alstyne, who's also chair of the information systems department, agrees that the use of our data isn't always bad. \"On one end is using a single user's data in service of the goals and benefits of that particular user; for example, if you've got a heart condition, the doctor wants to know all the data about your previous treatments to deliver the best in the next generation of treatment. Very few people object to that; that's exactly what should be happening. Then, on the opposite side of the spectrum, which is quite troubling, is using your data to exploit you, either through reshaping your opinionsas in the case of Cambridge Analytica [which was accused of harvesting data from Facebook to help political campaigns]or price discriminating and charging you more.\"</p><p>What next?</p><p>In Europe, regulators have pursued a privacy policy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), legislation that treats privacy as a fundamental human right, enhancing protections around personal data. \"GDPR applies to all data, all forms of personal data, whether it's extremely sensitive, like your health data, or less sensitive, like whether or not you clicked on an ad,\" says Johnson. He's studying the effectiveness of GDPR and says it's clear that even with limitations in place, websites continue to share information on their users.</p><p>Van Alstyne thinks neither Europe nor the United States has gotten it quite right when it comes to Big Tech and data legislation. \"The Europeans are a little too interventionist and quick to use government authority for privacy protection as distinct from wealth creation. By contrast, the American approach tends to be too much one of free markets and allowing firms to do as they pleaseand while that creates value, it also creates serious distortions of who gets to keep that value. The ideal solution is really somewhere in between, continuing to have companies create value, but taking into consideration the European approach of fair allocation.\"</p><p>We need new and better economics and legislation to get this rightand to understand that the nature of creating value has shifted drastically.</p><p>Marshall Van Alstyne, Questrom Professor in Management</p><p>He doesn't think it's enough to rely on legislation from a bygone age. \"In the industrial era, we saw giant firms in energy, cars, iron, oil, and railroads. All of those were supply-side economies of scale, with high fixed costs and low marginal costs. Today, however, we're seeing giant demand-side economies of scale with Big Tech, and specifically with platforms like Facebook and Amazon. Treating them as though they're supply-side economies of scale gets it wrong.\"</p><p>For Van Alstyne, legislation needs to consider how valuefor both consumers and companiesis being created. Companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon need to be asking how they can both yield a profit and provide beneficial products and services; should they produce their own goods or should they orchestrate those of others?</p><p>A lot of Big Tech companies have chosen the latter through what Van Alstyne calls the inverted firm, a model where the company's focus shifts from producing value within to producing value outside of the firm, encouraging others to create on their behalf.</p><p>\"In an open ecosystem, you can harness third parties,\" he says. \"You and I are creating the web pages, not Google. You and I are creating the posts, not Facebook. And current economists don't understand the inverted firm. We need new and better economics and legislation to get this rightand to understand that the nature of creating value has shifted drastically.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123260100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9J-62K1-DYTH-G1HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2162\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bruce and I are both dubious about the current media trope that facial recognition technology was spawned by the Antichrist. He notes that what we are really worried about is a lot bigger than facial recognition, and he offers ways in which the law could address that deeper worry. I'm less optimistic about our ability to write or enforce laws designed to restrict use of personal information , which after all gets cheaper to collect, to correlate, and to store every year. It's a good, civilized exchange.The News Roundup is a little truncated due to a technical failure. </p><p>(It was a glitch in Zencastr for those of you keeping score, and I definitely am). As a result, we lost Nick Weaver's[3] audio for about half the program, including a hammer and tongs debate with me over Apple's fight with the FBI. (But never fear, opportunities for that debate come by about as often as the Red Line comes to Dupont Circle.)That said, it's still a feisty episode. It begins with Michael Vatis[4] teeing off on the California Consumer Privacy Act, the worst-drafted law he's worked with in over 30 years of practice - and not much better on policy grounds.We then return to Illinois's recent law[5] regulating AI hiring interviews systems like HireVue[6], and sparks fly again as Mark MacCarthy[7] and I mix it up over allegations of AI \"bias.\" (I'm a skeptic, to put it mildly.)Matthew Heiman[8] covers the surprisingly thin claim[9] that the GRU has phished[10] its way into Burisma Holdings. And Nick comments on (yet another!) Italian surveillance tech firm getting into trouble[11] by misusing its capabilities.Not-so-Big Tech has begun asking Congress for antitrust help[12] against Big Tech. Mark is skeptical; I'm a little less so.Matthew and I compliment frequent contributor David Kris on his speed in delivering an amicus report[13] on the FBI's Horowitz reforms\u2014between one Cyberlaw Podcast episode and the next - and before his Congressional critics can even finish a letter[14] questioning his appointment. One lingering, and possibly salutary, effect of the kerfuffle is that some good questions are now being directed at the FISA Court itself, asking why it didn't do a better job of policing the Carter Page excesses.Mark reports on an unusual effort[15] by Europe's chief privacy officer to exempt academic researchers from strict compliance with data protections laws. Privacy law, as I've said for years, is all about privileging the powerful, and academics qualify, so of course they deserve a data protection exemption.In quick hits, Matthew notes that Erdogan has bowed to the Turkish Supreme Court and reinstated access to Wikipedia[16]. He also reports on the U.S. Department of the Interior permanently grounding its drone fleet[17] over spying concerns. Nick chuckles over China's APT 40 getting doxxed[18], and we both give credit to NSA's Anne Neuberger for disclosing and enabling the patch by Microsoft[19] of a major vulnerability[20] in the Crypt32 library. Finally, I predict that Clearview[21] will be sued for violating terms of service to obtain the facial recognition data it uses to provide identification services to law enforcement. Because privacy law is all about protecting the privileged, and crime victims don't qualify.Download the 296th Episode (mp3).[22]You can subscribe to The Cyberlaw Podcast using iTunes[23], Google Play[24], Spotify[25], Pocket Casts[26], or our RSS feed[27]!As always, The Cyberlaw Podcast is open to feedback.

People shop online at Amazon, chat and share photos on Facebook, search the internet on Google and text, talk and listen to music on Apple devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The executives of the four technology giants say their innovations, business practices and size allow them to sell easy-to-use products at inexpensive prices. Some are free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But others, led by U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., say the convenience offered by Big Tech masks the dangers of their dominance. Big Tech companies control the information they collect, stifle competition, destroy jobs and weaken the economy, Cicilline says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He adds that they are in a position to exploit their growing influence by charging exorbitant fees, imposing oppressive contracts and extracting more valuable data from people and businesses that rely on them.</p><p>\u201cSimply put: They have too much power,\u201d said Cicilline, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.</p><p>The subcommittee has spent 15 months studying Big Tech and may release its final report and recommendations as soon as this week. Cicilline declined to be interviewed, but in previous public comments he has suggested restricting Big Tech\u2019s power by strengthening antitrust laws and federal regulations. He has even discussed a government-ordered breakup, such as actions taken against corporate behemoths like Standard Oil and AT&amp;T.</p><p>He and his allies, however, are opposed by the Big Tech CEOs, their armies of lobbyists in Washington, D.C., and some members of Congress who argue that Cicilline is off track.</p><p>Also, there seems to be no public outcry calling for Big Tech reforms because consumers do not feel directly affected. People this year have been more worried about their jobs, racial justice, the presidential election and getting sick from the coronavirus.</p><p>Cicilline says the virus and its impacts have accelerated the urgency for reining in Big Tech because after COVID-19, the tech companies will emerge stronger and more powerful than ever.</p><p>\u201cAs American families shift more of their work, shopping and communications online, these giants stand to profit,\u201d he says. \u201cLocally-owned businesses \\x97 mom and pop stores on Main Street \\x97 face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history.\u201d</p><p>That will end up hurting everybody, he says.</p><p>Cicilline and his subcommittee have collected evidence, interviewed witnesses and held hearings that culminated on July 29 with testimony from Big Tech\u2019s CEOS: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundai Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary, Google LLC.</p><p>All four gave full-throated defenses of their businesses, arguing that they face fierce competition and are good for consumers.</p><p>Cicilline argued they are monopolies, for these reasons:</p><p>\\x95 Amazon controls 70% of online sales and runs businesses including cloud computing, movie production and small-business lending. The company\u2019s market valuation exceeds $1.5 trillion, bigger than Walmart, IBM and eBay.</p><p>\\x95 Apple dominates smartphone sales and has more than 100 million iPhone users in the United States. The company sells hardware services, apps for financial services, media and games.</p><p>\\x95 Facebook is the world\u2019s biggest provider of social networking services and sells digital ads. The company\u2019s profits were $18 billion last year.</p><p>\\x95 Google, owned by Alphabet, captures more than 90% of online searches, sells ads and has more than a billion users of its products, including browsers, smartphones and digital maps.</p><p>Others also see Big Tech\u2019s dominance.</p><p>\u201cThese are the natural monopolies of the 21st century,\u201d said Liam C. Malloy, chair and associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Rhode Island.</p><p>He explained that they benefit from an economic principle called the \u201cnetwork effect,\u201d in which the value of a product increases as more people use it. For example, the more people use Amazon to shop, the more small businesses must sell on Amazon\u2019s site.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that these firms have a dominant market position and have used that to reduce competition and increase profits,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cThat implies some need for regulation.\u201d</p><p>But a solution is elusive, because Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple operate differently with different products and platforms.</p><p>\u201cThere is no one-stop regulation for these companies,\u201d said Andrea Boggio, associate professor of legal studies at Bryant University.</p><p>He said, \u201cBig Tech falls in a bit of a legal vacuum\u201d because some are regulated only as websites and some as online retailers. If they were treated as media companies, the Federal Trade Commission could be given a broader mandate to regulate them, Boggio said.</p><p>The dual role Big Tech plays in the marketplace also concerns Cicilline. He has suggested prohibiting Big Tech companies from running a platform and competing with other independent merchants by selling their own products and services on it.</p><p>But Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos testified at the July 29 hearing that it is not anti-competitive or a conflict for Amazon to sell its products on the e-marketplace it controls.</p><p>\u201cThe consumer is the one ultimately making the decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cThey\u2019re making the decisions about what to buy, and who to buy it from.\u201d</p><p>He said other retailers, including grocery and drug stores, sell self-made products in their stores.</p><p>Cicilline and others said that Big Tech\u2019s collection of data from its dual purposes \\x97 and decisions about who gets to use the information \\x97 also need more regulation.</p><p>\u201cEach platform uses its control over digital infrastructure to surveil other companies \\x97 their growth, business activity and whether they pose a competitive threat,\u201d he said, \u201cEach platform has used this data to protect its power, by either buying, copying or cutting off access for any actual or potential rival.\u201d</p><p>Pichai, the Google CEO, denied in testimony to Congress that the company leverages its search engine to steal information from competitors and use the data to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p>The collection and use of information have created winners and losers throughout business history, said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>\u201cWhoever controls the data controls the market,\u201d he said, \u201cThe collection and hoarding of digital data fuels the software algorithms that deliver the companies and services.\u201d</p><p>He said that\u2019s the 21st-century equivalent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s 20th-century monopoly over oil.</p><p>He recommends that government regulators require Big Tech to share the data it collects to give entrepreneurs and others an equal opportunity to enter markets.</p><p>He also advocates the creation of a new Digital Platform Agency, similar to the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, to monitor and regulate anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Malloy, the URI professor, said that Big Tech\u2019s collection, use and control of digitized data is the biggest difference with earlier industrial giants.</p><p>He suggests that collectors sell the data to a government-run or government-regulated clearinghouse and that users of the data pay for it.</p><p>He said existing antitrust laws don\u2019t need to be rewritten, but the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission need to do a better job of enforcing them. He said regulators have allowed mergers and acquisitions that have led to concentrated industries, a reference to Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram for $1 billion and WhatsApp for $19 billion.</p><p>He also said Big Tech is better compared with utilities, and therefore should be regulated like a utility.</p><p>Any legislative proposals by Cicilline and his allies will face challenges from some members of his subcommittee and other members of Congress.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said he\u2019s not convinced that new antitrust laws are needed. He suggested improved enforcement of existing laws, and he opposes changes that would prompt breakups of the companies.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the subcommittee should focus on the companies that regularly silence conservatives, and he has filed a bill that removes liability protections from tech companies in an effort to curb alleged political bias.</p><p>Framing the debate is the public\u2019s interest in Big Tech, or how it affects their lives.</p><p>The reason \u201cpeople aren\u2019t more upset about the market power of these firms is because they don\u2019t see it affecting them directly,\u201d said Malloy.</p><p>But Cicilline asserts that there is indirect damage being done now that will eventually have a direct impact on people, the economy and democracy.</p><p>\u201cOpen markets are predicated on the idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers and business partners will choose another option,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat choice is no longer possible.\u201d</p><p>John Kostrzewa, a former assistant managing editor/business at The Providence Journal, can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:johnekostrzewa@gmal.com\">johnekostrzewa@gmal.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Big Tech has grown into a mainstay of everyday life.

Perhaps less so than before Christmas, but there's no shortage of developers promising vast swathes of square footage around the capital. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the completion dates on the developments vary, projected occupancy rates are almost uniform following a year that saw the highest level of activity ever recorded in Dublin's office space market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, so positive. But, some of those with skin in the game suggest that the office space party is beginning to come to an end. Denis O'Brien, himself a commercial property investor, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irish Times</emphasis> in Davos that Dublin is in the midst of an office-market bubble and there \"won't be enough\" people to put in them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He's not the first to suggest that Dublin's office offering is on track to outstrip demand. In September, Anne Breen of Aberdeen Standard Investments, said that if construction continues at current levels, the city will have a glut of offices. </p><p>So is it the case that we're returning to the trends of the recent past or are the voices of the naysayers simply being given too much attention?</p><p>Certainly, there's a lot of activity. As Knight Frank noted in its review of the market in 2017, 334,450 sq m (3.6 million sq ft) was let as the market expanded for the fifth consecutive year. More interestingly, they say the top 10 deals last year were higher than the combined total of deals between 2009 and 2016. </p><p>Take-up in the city centre was particularly strong, accounting for 61 per cent. But perhaps that portion of the market is in line for a slowdown. This week, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irish Times</emphasis> learned that the famously tight-lipped Google is taking just shy of 4,924 sq m (53,000 sq ft) in Sandyford, a move that marks a shift in its office accommodation strategy. </p><p>The company had, until now, mostly concentrated its office space needs around the Dublin 4 area of the city - so much so that the area has earned the moniker Silicon Docks. Google does have a presence in East Point, and had previously signed a small agreement in Sandyford, but this lease mirrors the size of the recent move into the Velasco building. </p><p>Then of course there's Microsoft. It has expanded its Dublin presence but far away from the bright lights of Grafton Street, instead bringing its workers closer to the racing action in a brand new building in Leopardstown. </p><p>They're just two players in the market, and not necessarily indicative of an overall shift. LinkedIn, for example, only last year moved into its new offices on Wilton Place. But if these companies are looking to move lower-value roles to lower-cost areas, the suburbs could be in line for a boost. </p><p>Last year was one that saw demand for office space driven by the technology, media and telecommunications sectors, which accounted for 51 per cent of take-up. In a distant second came the finance sector, accounting for 20 per cent. This raises another question of whether we're shoving too many eggs into one basket. If big tech was to pull out tomorrow, Grand Canal would be as quiet as Ballaghaderreen on a December morning. </p><p>\"Clearly, if there's a sudden shock to the system and one of them has to pull out, that would clearly have adverse effects,\" Lisney's Paul Hipwell told this newspaper last month. </p><h>More demand than London This premature concern may be misplaced. The suggestion from those familiar with the Dublin market is that, for the most part, there's far less risk than there was before. </h><p>\"There are very few new leases signed with a break option within the next 10 years,\" says Goodbody property analyst Colm Lauder. \"[Developers are] trying to have responsible income streams and de-risk these things as much as possible.\"</p><p>Lauder suggests developers have been minimising their income risk by opting for longer leases and fewer breaks, \"thus boosting net effective income\". </p><p>Compared to London, one source in a multinational financial services company said, Dublin has more supply. \"The potential risk is greater but, at the moment, it seems to have more tenant demand [than London].\"</p><p>They noted, however, that Dublin has typically been a cyclical market in the past, even more so than London. From an international investor point of view, more worrying is the fact that the market is prone to sudden changes in regulation and central government policy, industry insiders say. The surprise and unwelcome change in commercial stamp duty announced in the recent budget is cited as an example. </p><p>Savills Ireland chairman Roland O'Connell says all property markets are cyclical \"and there's no doubt that, at some stage, we'll end up in a slightly oversupplied situation and that we'll see a bit of a downturn, but I don't think we see it yet\".</p><p>For investors, he thinks Dublin still provides promising opportunities. \"As a buyer to develop, I still think it's a good time. Assuming you're buying your sites at sensible values, it is still profitable to develop offices.\" </p><p>Office rents currently hover around the EUR 65 per sq ft mark - not far off the prime peak. If pricing is an indicator of what stage of the cycle the market is at, then surely a slowdown is to be expected. Goodbody predicts rents will float between EUR 60 and EUR 62.50 per sq ft in 2019, slightly lower than the highs of this year. </p><p>O'Connell, however, suggests market equilibrium is still about two years off. </p><p>Craig Wright, a European property analyst with Aberdeen Standard, agrees. \"We think the supply coming on stream between now and 2020 will largely be absorbed and that should mean rents will remain stable,\" he said. </p><p>Sources familiar with the real estate investment trusts operating in Ireland signal they have learned lessons from the mistakes of previous cycles. Both Hibernia Reit and Green Reit have gradually weaned their portfolios off speculative development as the market begins to normalise. </p><p>For Green Reit, a play into the logistics market could be seen as an insurance policy against a fall in office take-up. One person knowledgeable on their strategy suggests, however, that the company believes the market is operating in a well-balanced manner. But they did highlight transport infrastructure for residential developments as a constraint. </p><p>Whatever about the mixed messages coming from the industry on how the Dublin office market is performing, people agree that the constraints in Ireland are still significant, something that could potentially deter prospective investors or movers. </p><p> Wright highlighted issues with housing and school places and said: \"I know it's been an issue for chief executives moving to Ireland. It's been a barrier, but it's discussed in the market as a constraint.\"</p><p>The lack of thought given to how these office spaces will be serviced with a corresponding volume of residential units is clearly an issue of concern for speculative investors. John Ring, head of research at Knight Frank, said in residential terms, \"it's no doubt been an issue\".</p><p>\"The low delivery has been high on the agenda for multinationals. It'll probably take a couple of years to resolve itself.\"</p><p>Despite that, Ring says new demand is emerging from Asia, with institutional investors there, content with a lower rate of return, showing interest in Dublin - now seen as a core European market. </p><p>Buyers from the US and Europe account for 29 per cent and 22 per cent respectively, a statistic that shows the \"considerable depth in the market\", according to Knight Frank. </p><p>And although yields dropped to 4 per cent in the second half of last year, that was still competitive compared to European peers, with German and UK office yields below 3.75 per cent, according to Goodbody.</p><h>Landlords' market </h><p>For some time, the Dublin market hasn't been one that favoured tenants. Only last month, Lisney suggested the presence of tech firms in the city centre is pushing indigenous Irish business to seek space in the suburbs.  </p><p>\"It remains a landlords' market,\" said Tony Waters, managing director of real estate agency HWBC. On the comments from O'Brien, Waters said it was sensible to be prudent after five years of gains, \"but all the indicators are that there is ample demand for space as it is completed, and close to 40 per cent of the space planned for 2018 is already pre-let\". </p><p>This week, would-be investors in the logistics sector got another boost when Core Industrial Reit announced its intention to float. Perhaps in the not-too-distant future, the limelight in commercial property will be shone firmly on the industrial sector, which delivered returns of about 14.5 per cent for the 12 months to the end of September, according to the MSCI Ireland property index. Whether success in logistics will be at the expense of the office sector is anyone's guess. But if Brexit doesn't provide the expected boost to staff numbers in Dublin, the market could become one in which tenants can have their cake and eat it once again. </p><p>\"That's probably a good thing for the market overall that there's choice for tenants,\" Roland O'Connell from Savills said. </p><p>While it's difficult to find somebody who signs up to O'Brien's thinking that we're on the verge of an office bubble, Ireland hasn't exactly had a healthy relationship with property and perhaps his crystal ball is right to indicate a slowdown in the market - something tenants, or at least those who have been priced out of the city centre, would undoubtedly welcome. </p><h>Top 10 deals in 2017  </h><p> Tenant Location Sq Ft 1 Microsoft Leopardstown 301,400 2 Indeed Sir John rogerson's

Earlier in December Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, told the Fina...</p><p>Competition policy in the EU is undergoing rapid change. </p><p>Earlier in December Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, told the Financial Times she was looking at how to curb unfair competition from state-owned companies from outside the EU. And in a recent speech she vowed to review and update how her agency delineates the markets where competitive pressures are measured.</p><p>In that speech, she compared the task of defining markets to \u201ccharting a coastline. The shape is already there \u2014 our job is just to measure it as accurately as we can. And nothing we do will change the shape of that coastline itself.\u201d</p><p>But that is a stretch. Through the terms of the trade agreements it concludes and by its regulation of the EU\u2019s own single market, the European Commission certainly influences the size and shape of markets, even if perhaps its competition arm in a narrow sense takes the \u201ccoastlines\u201d as given. </p><p>Indeed, Ms Vestager herself will be shaping markets in her parallel role as commissioner for the digital economy. Decisions she takes in her mission to make Europe \u201cfit for the digital age\u201d will have an impact on who the effective competitors are in digital and data-intensive sectors. </p><p>That raises the question of whether there is a risk that the two parts of Ms Vestager\u2019s portfolio could contradict each other. </p><p>Laurence Boone, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, suggests it is logical to run digital and competition policy together. One reason is that \u201ccompetition policy has to evolve because of digitisation\u201d, she said. </p><p>The digital economy brings new challenges \u2014 OECD experts including Ms Boone have for example warned against \u201calgorithmic collusion\u201d. It also demands new tools for competition authorities that are designed for a digital world \u2014 for example, data portability requirements. </p><p>Old tools must also be applied in new ways because \u201cdigitisation is changing the pace of things\u201d, added Ms Boone. The same point was raised by a recent review of competition policy for the UK government by Jason Furman, formerly an economics adviser to Barack Obama when he was US president. </p><p>For example, rather than approve a merger once and for all, \u201cperhaps you have to revisit mergers two or three years down the road, maybe you need clauses allowing you to revise something\u201d, said Ms Boone. She thinks that Ms Vestager \u201cis taking the right direction\u201d of \u201cflexibility and pragmatism\u201d. </p><p>As flexible and pragmatic as it may be, the commission\u2019s approach does look as though it is becoming tougher on Big Tech. </p><p>Ms Vestager is reviving so-called \u201cinterim measures\u201d to restrain suspected anti-competitive behaviour while investigations are going on, rather than wait for them to conclude, and has indicated the burden of proof may shift against those accused of stifling competition.</p><p>Could a more aggressive competition policy stifle innovation? There seems to be at least the potential for a conflict with the revived popularity of industrial policy in Europe. </p><p>But Ms Boone said that as long as authorities do not try to \u201cpick firms\u201d, competition policy should allow \u201cthe public sector to kick-start innovation\u201d. She pointed to Darpa, the US military agency that promotes technology research, as a \u201cclean way of mixing competition and innovation at the same time\u201d. </p><p>It is a popular inspiration: there is a lot of interest in the EU in building a European equivalent of Darpa, including from Thierry Breton, the French commissioner for the EU\u2019s internal market and responsible for the bloc\u2019s industrial strategy. </p><p>The optimistic take is that competition policy is not only compatible with innovation but can become a powerful political asset. Competition helps consumers by driving prices down or quality up. It can also be used to show that politicians are serious on dismantling a rigged system that favours well-placed companies. </p><p>It is \u201ca superb political opportunity because it kills two birds with one stone\u201d, according to Ms Boone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-3185ca26233a11eab8a1584213ee7b2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVW-0WH1-JB77-K1HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

And is Europe ready for it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those questions are perplexing policy makers around the European Union these days. The stakes are high: Europe, it\u2019s often said, was late to the Internet party and ceded ground to now-dominant US companies. It started strong in mobile telephony, but retreated in the face of stiff Asian competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody, in government or industry, wants to miss the next big tech wave \u2013 and that has led to a small industry of experts forecasting technology trends. The OECD, for instance, recently pooled studies from its developed-country members to identify 10 key technologies that will matter for the future. The list includes artificial intelligence, big data analysis, blockchain financial technology, synthetic biology and nano-materials. Most, it says, will pose social and ethical dilemmas \u2013 and several factors are needed for success, including ample public research support.</p><p>Here, we look briefly at three emerging fields: gene-editing, quantum computers and deep offshore wind production. Each has the potential to expand the scope of human possibilities \u2013 or create new problems. Either way, if Europe is to have a say in how they develop, it needs to matter in the marketplace. For these three technologies, we ask: can it? 1. Making today\u2019s supercomputers obsolete</p><p>Scientists are laying the foundation for arguably the most sophisticated piece of technology ever. A working quantum computer, experts say, could solve problems that even the most powerful supercomputers today cannot attempt. Several of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies are investing in the field, with Google, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin and IBM each having dedicated quantum computing research groups.</p><p>So far, however, breakthroughs in the lab are difficult to replicate, and don\u2019t support commercial activity. \u201cThere are devices tested right now which can measure gravity ten times more accurately. But any industry applications related to this discovery only show two to three times the improvement,\u201d says Richard Murray, Innovate UK\u2019s lead for emerging technologies and industries.</p><p>Europe has some notable skin in the game. The quantum computer with the most qubits so far \u2014 20 \u2014 is being tested at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. European companies such as MuQuans, E2V and Thales are developing near-term applications in quantum sensing and metrology.</p><p>But it\u2019s a complex picture. For commercial applications, \u201cyou could argue that the US is ahead of Europe,\u201d says Peter Bentley, author and computer scientist at University College London. \u201cIn areas such as fundamental science and simulation, you could argue that Europe is ahead.\u201d</p><p>A quantum machine would be an entirely different beast than the traditional PC, where the unit of information is binary digits or \u2018bits\u2019 and can have a value of either 1 or 0, representing on/off, true/false states. Its equivalent in a quantum system \u2013 called a quantum bit or qubit \u2013 can be both 1s and zeros at the same time, a state known as superposition. This gives quantum machines the theoretical ability to carry out trillions of calculations per second.</p><p>Drumming up investment for quantum has been a challenge, with some exceptions. The British government is investing \u00a3270 million over five years for four quantum technology hubs. In Germany, the government has made research into secure quantum communications a priority, with \u20ac9.5 million funding over three years, while the Netherlands is investing \u20ac130 million to build a quantum computer. A year ago, the European Commission announced that it would create a \u20ac1 billion research effort in the field, and it should start to invite grant applications later this year. \u00a0</p><p>The effort may not be enough to fend off fierce competition from China and the US, says Anton Zeilinger, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna. During the summer, China tested what may be the world\u2019s first unhackable communication system, which uses quantum technology to encrypt data so securely that it can\u2019t be got at without sounding an instant, hacker-proof alarm. \u201cWith the exception of the UK, no European country is investing enough in the field,\u201d Zeilinger warns. 2. The \u2018unthinkable power to control evolution\u2019</p><p>Despite the incredible number-crunching promise of quantum tech, probably no invention this century has as much far-reaching potential as the gene-editing tool Crispr/Cas9.</p><p>In 2012, Jennifer Doudna, a microbiologist at the University of California at Berkeley, and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier co-published the first findings pointing to a cheap and quick way to fix genes. Crispr/Cas9 allows scientists to precisely insert, delete or repair single letters of genetic code. To quote the title of Doudna\u2019s memoir, the tool represents \u201cthe unthinkable power to control evolution\u201d.</p><p>Already, the US is threatening to corner the market on gene-editing. The three companies that have licensed the technology for human therapeutics and floated \u2014 Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and Crispr Therapeutics \u2014 have their R&amp;D operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about a mile apart from each other. Crispr Therapeutics, a Basel-headquartered company, decided it could raise more money on the Nasdaq than on any stock exchange in Europe.</p><p>Finding funding for unproven tech in Europe is an age-old problem, according to Barbara Freischem, executive director of European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises, based in Brussels. \u201cThere\u2019s simply not enough specialised funds here. You can travel around and see all the European funds in five days. Spend five days in New York and you still haven\u2019t left Fifth Avenue,\u201d she said.</p><p>That is not to say there are no big pushes here. In 2015, Crispr Therapeutics partnered with Bayer to launch a joint venture, with the German pharma giant pledging to invest at least $300 million over five years. Also, an Irish company called ERS Genomics is licensing Charpentier\u2019s work for research and other non-therapeutic applications.</p><p>Patient trials are still in the planning stages, but gene editing may one day protect babies from a variety of hereditary conditions such as muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis, and enable plants to yield more food and resist drought.</p><p>European scientists must also compete with countries, like the US, where gene-edited products are not regarded as being the same as genetically-modified organisms (at least for now). Continued legal limbo on gene editing tech in Europe could see studies and advances in different member states put off or held up. The EU has not been able to decide yet on how to regulate gene-editing: without updated rules, it seems unlikely we\u2019ll see human clinical trials in Europe in the near future. 3. Wind in Europe\u2019s sails</p><p>Wind may not sound like a very hot technology \u2013 but the challenges of deep water \u2018floating wind farms\u2019 could unlock many new opportunities for energy creation, and sustain Europe\u2019s already-strong position in wind technologies. \u00a0</p><p>The problem to be solved is simple to state: \u201cAll the very favourable shallow water depths \u2013 the low hanging fruit \u2013 are already taken by wind farms,\u201d explains Bruno Geschier, chief sales and marketing officer with French manufacturer Ideol. Instead, the new challenge is deep-water wind farms. Conventional turbines have foundations embedded in a shallow sea floor; floating turbines, well, just float. \u00a0</p><p>The further you go offshore, the stronger the wind gets, so the potential prize is a big one. Harnessing it could see Europe produce its electricity needs many times over, Geschier says. \u201cIn fact, without floating wind farms, the EU can\u2019t achieve its renewable targets,\u201d he predicts.</p><p>European companies such as Norwegian oil group Statoil, Ideol, and Spain\u2019s Cobra, are leading the charge on the technology side, which is currently very expensive, and have launched world-first trials in waters off the coast of Norway, Scotland and Portugal. If the projects are a success, they will be pursued globally, for example in the steeply shelved coastlines off the US West Coast or Japan. This would help further drive down costs, and propel wind above other forms of low-carbon electricity generation.</p><p>The price of offshore wind energy has fallen far faster that anyone predicted. In 2014, the power generated by a forest of turbines out at sea was priced at around \u00a3150 per megawatt hour. Today this cost has dropped as low as \u00a357.50 The dramatic price fall means companies such as Denmark\u2019s Dong Energy can now develop offshore schemes without the help of subsidies.</p><p>The success of wind power also sets the stage for further innovations. The world\u2019s biggest wind-turbine maker, Denmark\u2019s Vestas Wind Systems, is working with US car and battery maker Tesla to figure out how to combine wind turbines and batteries, storing away power during breezy times to use when the air is still.

American tech firms have traditionally opposed regulation, and scorned the efforts of European countries to bring them to heel. Yet here was Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, telling a data protection conference in Brussels last year: \"It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Granted, Apple is famously pro-privacy, at least outside China (where it follows local laws mandating government access to user data). Yet Cook is not alone in singing the praises of the European Union. Brad Smith of Microsoft, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Aaron Levie of the cloud storage firm Box are all on record as believing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">the USA should copy the EU in some way</url> .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Mark Zuckerberg, who had said last year that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">he was not sure whether Facebook should be regulated</url>, has very publicly changed his tune, writing, in an op-ed in the Washington Post: \"People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the EU's... and I agree.\"</p><p>Why are tech companies suddenly so keen to be told what to do? And why are they looking to Europe specifically? The answer, in part, lies on the influence that European efforts are having on the rest of the world - particularly in the US, which has the power to affect internet users across the world because so many tech firms are headquartered there.\u00a0</p><p>\"[The EU] won in the market of ideas,\" says Professor Paul Schwartz, director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology in California. \"Brad Smith [of Microsoft] and Tim Cook, they're speaking the language of data protection law. What they're saying is it's a human right. It's really quite noticeable... think about French ideas of liberty and freedom jumping over the Atlantic and influencing the American Revolution.\" Now, he says, it is happening again.</p><p>The EU's most influential move has been the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a massive privacy law which finally came into effect last year after almost a decade of methodical work by Martin Selmayr, the head of the EU's civil service (reportedly nicknamed \"the monster\" for his hardball tactics).</p><p>What has been done so far</p><p>But tech giants have also faced action from Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, who has earned the wrath of Donald Trump by leving $9.4bn in fines against Google alone.</p><p>Other commissioners have corralled Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into voluntary codes of conduct on fake news, political advertising and hate speech, increasing the share of illegal content deleted within 24 hours from 28pc in 2016 to 72pc this February.</p><p>National governments have also grown bolder. In Germany, Angela Merkels' government passed a \"Network Enforcement Act\", popularly called the NetzDG, setting deadlines for the deletion of illegal content.</p><p>In France, Emmanuel Macron and his new digital minister C\u00e9dric O have convinced Facebook to agree to an audit of its algorithms and to give French courts information about hate speech suspects (previously it only did so for violent offences such as terrorism).</p><p>In Britain, after a campaign by the Daily Telegraph, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">Government has announced plans to give tech firms a duty of care towards under-18s</url>, possibly to be enforced by a brand new regulator.</p><p>\"The EU has certainly led the way in developing a strong, comprehensive approach to privacy protection,\" says Eleni Kyriakides, international counsel for the Washington DC-based Electronic Privacy Information Centre. \"The US is one of the few advanced democracies without comprehensive privacy legislation. GDPR-style legislation is, simply put, long overdue.\" James P Steyer, founder of the US lobby group Common Sense, likewise says that \"momentum\" is now on the side of \"citizens who are calling for privacy protections and digital wellbeing as an industry standard\".\u00a0</p><p>American politicians have taken notice. In a series of US senate hearings on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">how to regulate Big Tech</url>, GDPR has been a constant touchstone for senators' interrogation of executives.</p><p>The state of California has passed its own privacy bill, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), explicitly inspired by GDPR. Beyond North America, Brazil, Thailand and Japan have also passed data privacy laws closely modeled after GDPR, while France, Australia and New Zealand are following similar paths on hate speech and terrorism.</p><p>US 'clearly\u00a0inspired'\u00a0by Europe</p><p>According to Steve Weber, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information, GDPR has served \"as a big signal that governments can do this, and as a lodestar\" for how it can be done. He says the CCPA was \"clearly inspired\" by European laws - even if many people who discuss it \"don't actually know what it is\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">At a glance | Your data rights under GDPR</url></p><p>Schwartz adds that the EU has benefited from being \"flexible\", allowing different countries to implement its ideas in their own way and extending its reach via negotiation and influence rather than by the sheer force of of its market power.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission is reportedly mulling a fine against Facebook that would be bigger than any it has ever levied - but comparable to those already levied by the EU. American politicians are talking more openly than ever before about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">breaking up tech giants,</url> or at least restraining their market power.</p><p>Elements of the NetzDG have also become visible in global discussions about online hate speech. Both Facebook and YouTube now publish regular statistics on how much content they have taken down, similar to those required in Germany. Zuckerberg has said that other companies should follow suit, and that nation states should \"set baselines\" for content moderation.\u00a0</p><p>The battle is not yet over</p><p>This global wave is ultimately why tech giants have changed their tune. \"These folks are past the point of believing they can continue to exist in this splendid, permission-less isolation ,\" says Weber. \"Maybe two years ago people would say, 'look, we're in a short-term storm and if we can just ride that out, we can do whatever we want to do.'\" That train has left the station, and now the sense is that if there's going to be meaningful regulation then let's shape that regulation in a way that helps us.\"\u00a0</p><p>But Europe's battle is not finished yet. To start with, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">GDPR itself has not yet led to that much change</url>, with many companies simply adding more permission checklists to their services.</p><p>Whether anyone is even behaving differently is still an \"open question,\" says Schwartz. \"Could you say that practices are fundamentally different in the EU, regarding technology and collection of data, than they are in the US?\" Probably not - so how much would an American GDPR really change?</p><p>Indeed, most observers of Capitol Hill now believe that attempts to create such a law have stalled, with no legislation expected until after 2020.</p><p>Some experts have argued before Congress that GDPR would be the wrong model because users are not capable of meaningfully consenting to the dizzying array of data collection practices that tech companies employ. Meanwhile, the CCPA has become bogged down in a sludge of amendments, backed by tech industry lobbyists, which insert new loopholes and undermine its protections.</p><p>There are other reasons to doubt Silicon Valley's embrace of regulation. In Germany, for instance, Facebook has just been fined 2 million euros (\u00a31.8m) for not making its transparency report transparent enough. According to the court, its statistics included \"only a fraction\" of complaints, and its interface for reporting illegal content is \"too hidden\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Zuckerberg's op-ed also avoided mention of any deadlines for taking down content - arguably the NetzDG's most important component, but one which Facebook has persistently lobbied against.</p><p>Similarly, on GDPR, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/social-media-has-become-dangerous-wild-west1/\">tech companies have been supportive of watered-down versions</url>, laws which look a lot like the EU's but which are missing fundamental clauses, like the need for a lawful basis for processing someone's information. One such bill failed to pass in Washington state earlier this year.\u00a0</p><p>Ultimately, Weber believes that European tech laws will continue to influence American politics - but not necessarily in the way Martin Selmayr might hope. \"Europe plays this weird shadow reality role in American thinking,\" he says. \"Two years ago we were saying that the Europeans were going to hamstring themselves with GDPR, they're going to set back the development of AI by years, and they don't understand the digital economy. Now that we have come around to the idea that we should do something, we idealise the Europeans: 'wow, they've figured it out!'\"\u00a0</p><p>In his view, the US has arrived at this regulatory moment for its own reasons (such as liberal backlash against the role of Facebook in the election of Donald Trump), and the spectre of Europe is an easily available crutch.</p><p>In fact, Weber argues that even though US politicians have more power to regulate tech giants than the EU, they might be less willing to do so because they depend on Silicon Valley - for job creation, economic growth, a buoyant stock market and, naturally, campaign contributions.</p><p>The EU, however, seems happy to press forward alone. Its member states have just nominated Ursula von der Leyen, a German defence minister, as the new head of the European Commission. She has long called for greater regulation of Big Tech, and is is expected to keep Vestager in her post. If that happens, it probably won't matter whether Silicon Valley's smiles are sincere.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-54270076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH5-KFS1-F021-63RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1599\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Part of this is the American public's shifting attitudes toward Big Tech and platforms in general. But the driving problem has been the way the platform was tied up with and perhaps implicated in Russia's attempt to influence[1] the 2016 presidential election. Users' trust in the platform has been shaken, politicians are threatening scrutiny and possible regulation, and there's even a campaign to get people to delete their Facebook accounts. </p><p>All of this is widely known and we hear more about it every day. But most users, most people in tech and also Wall Street (which is the source of Facebook's gargantuan valuation) don't yet get the full picture. We know about Facebook's reputational crisis. But people aren't fully internalizing that the current crisis poses a potentially dire threat to Facebook's core business model, its core advertising business. Facebook is fundamentally an advertising business. Almost all of the company's revenue comes from advertising that it targets with unparalleled efficiency to its billions of users. In a media world in which advertising rates face almost universal downward pressure, Facebook's rates have consistently risen. Monopoly power may drive some of that growth. But the key driver is efficiency. If old-fashioned advertising shows my advertisement to 100 people for every actual buyer and other digital platforms show it to 30 people and Facebook shows it to 5 people, Facebook's ads are just worth a lot more.As long as the rates bear some relationship to that efficiency (those numbers above are just for illustration), I'll be happy to pay it. Because it's objectively worth more. Indeed, as the prices have gone up, Facebook has actually gotten more efficient. As one digital ad agency executive recently told me, even if Facebook jacked up the prices a lot more, his firm would likely keep using them just as much because on this cost to efficiency basis it's still cheap. This is the basis of Facebook's astronomical market capitalization which today rates at over $450 billion, even after some recent reverses. So the money comes from the advertising. And the advertising comes from the data and the artificial intelligence that crunches it and models it into predictive efficiency. But what if there's a breakdown in the data? Starting in a early March, a number of marketers running substantial sums on the Facebook ad engine, who've spoken to TPM, started noticing a new level of platform instability and reductions in targeting efficiency. To understand what this means, think about it like how an efficient debt or equity market operates. If there is relatively accurate information, no big external shocks and enough buyers and sellers, pricing should have relative stability and operate within certain bands. Accounting for some reasonable amount of bumpiness that's what Facebook's ad engine has looked like for a few years. But starting in March, if you're down in the trenches working with the granular numbers, something started to look weird: price oscillations, reduced targeting efficiency and even glitches. We've talked to a number of advertisers who've reported this. We've also talk to others who haven't. But the ones who have tend to be the ones more tightly tied to the numbers and in marketing operations with tighter ROI (return on investment). Where we've seen the most of this is with so-called DTC (direct to consumer) marketers. Facebook is an amazingly large ecosystem. And it's all a black box. So there's no way for us to talk to a representative sample of advertisers. But something is going on in at least substantial sectors of Facebook's ad engine. What is it? Marketers who've asked mainly get told it's their creativity. In other words, the ad you're running isn't working. Come up with another ad. Here at TPM, we operate in a different part of the programmatic ad universe. You hear comparable things like that a lot. And it's hard to ignore. But we've talked to people with different people with (by definition) different ads in totally different industries. So that's not it. Something is happening. So what's up?One thing is already being discussed widely in the trade press[2]. In response to the rolling public relations debacle Facebook has already dramatically reduced or has announced that it will reduce advertisers' ability to use third party ad data on the Facebook platform. That is a big deal. What's that mean? Let's clarify some terms. As you know, through your activity on Facebook, Facebook collects lots of data about you that it then uses to target ads. That's 'Facebook data' (or it's yours, but you know what I mean). Facebook also allows advertisers to upload '1st party data'. What's that? That's if my book publishing company has a list of 50,000 emails, I can upload those emails to Facebook and run ads to those people. Then there's '3rd party data'. That's if the advertiser or Facebook itself goes to another personal data broker, buys access to that data and pours it into the Facebook ecosystem for more efficient targeting. If you're not versed in the world of data and digital advertising, there's a ton here to keep up with. But here's the key. How reliant is Facebook's advertising cash cow on third party data? Not just the third party data that Facebook allows advertisers to put into its ecosystem for better targeting (which is now being phased out) but 3rd party data Facebook uses itself to improve its ad targeting? As one data industry executive put it to me, sure Facebook can crunch its own data to find out all sorts of things about you. But in a lot of cases it may be easier, cheaper and in some cases simply more effective to buy that data from other sources. We don't really know - and no one outside Facebook really knows - how good Facebook's AI really is at modeling user data entirely on its own without other sorts of data mixed in. It's a black box. It matters a lot in terms of Facebook's core revenue stream. Here's another question: when you consider Facebook's own data, how reliant is Facebook on ways it collects and processes Facebook data which it may not be able to do any longer either because of new regulations that come into effect later this year for the EU[3] or because of new regulations Congress may put into effect as it puts new scrutiny on Facebook's behavior?My hunch is that the answer to most or all of these questions is 'a lot more than most people realize.' We already know that Facebook is making a lot of changes to how it uses data, especially third party data and how it allows advertisers to use data. Some of this is already public. Indeed, it's getting discussed a lot in the trade press - particular how Facebook will implement with and cope with the new regs from the European Union. So why all the choppiness in Facebook's advertising and targeting metrics? I suspect that Facebook is trying to rejigger its algorithm on the fly more than people realize in order to see if they can get it to work as effectively for ads without a lot of data sources or data uses they really aren't supposed to be doing or which they suspect they'll lose access to in coming regulation. That is the most logical explanation of the instability in their reporting. If you talk to ad industry people, they treat it as a given that Facebook is already having to 'rebuild their platform basically from the ground up' as one top agency executive told me, in response to 'fake news', propaganda campaigns, privacy scrutiny, etc. - all the stuff we've read about over recent months. But it's Facebook. They'll work it out, is what these people figure. And they're probably right. Facebook is huge, has massive resources and access to the world's largest audience for anything ever. They have oceans of data and a massive leg up on everyone. Down at the more granular level though, even in the industry press, it is treated as a given that the already publicly announced new restrictions on third party data will likely lead to at least some migration of advertisers to new platforms. Ginny Marvin, a top trade press reporter working at the granular ad tech and marketing level rather than up in tech big think land, tweeted this on March 30th[4]: 'FB removing 3P [3rd party] data is a big change for advertisers. But at FB's scale, you're not going to see advts sharply pivot elsewhere en masse. This will look more like a slow moving ship of budgets diverting to other media if they don't get performance they want from FB.' For now, as Marvin notes, Facebook's advertiser lock-in, market power and simple price value make it highly unlikely that there's going to be any dramatic near-term move from Facebook even in the worse case scenario. But Facebook isn't just making money hand over fist. It's market valuation rests on the assumption that it will keep making that amount of money hand over fist and indeed keep increasing the amount of money it makes hand over fist. Any breakdown or significant slowdown in that growth and consistency is a big problem. Years ago, everyone counted Facebook out as a true profit platform, until it exceeded everyone's expectations. Now, even with all the bad press, most figure that it's profitable forever. Both conventional wisdoms were wrong. For now, keep in mind that Facebook isn't just dealing with a reputational crisis. It's having to clean up the reputational mess by rejiggering parts of its core revenue stream it's not clear it really knows how to do. That creates a lot of unpredictability. More than most people seem to realize.

Back then, Facebook was worth around \u20ac80 billion and had 650 million users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, nearly four times that number around the world use the social network, the company is valued at over \u20ac445 billion, Zuckerberg\u2019s personal fortune is estimated to be around \u20ac60 billion and he is one of the most powerful business people on the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So for all these reasons, and because of the general public fascination with him, there was plenty of buzz when the 34-year-old stopped off in Dublin again last Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was on his way back from Germany, where he had gone to speak with policymakers, academics, business leaders and the media.</p><p>Facebook characterised the Dublin stop as a listening and communication exercise. A chance to meet some TDs, the firm\u2019s nearly 5,000 staff here and the media.</p><p>(It probably would have been an opportunity to meet both the Taoiseach and Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon, except it turned out both were out of the country on business.)</p><p>But others described it as nothing more than a cynical charm offensive, a PR stunt.</p><p>Either way, the founder was clearly attempting once again to send out the message that Facebook is sorry for the mistakes of the past and to outline how it hopes things will be done differently from now on.</p><p>And change is undoubtedly necessary. </p><p>After all, the company has been convulsed by scandal after scandal in recent years - from Cambridge Analytica to a string of big data breaches; and from electoral interference and fake news, to a fundamental failure to keep its users away from harm on the platform.</p><p>Last weekend, Mr Zuckerberg signaled how he sees the future for Facebook and social media in an op-ed piece published in the Sunday Independent and a number of international titles.</p><p>He also fleshed that out in an exclusive one-to-one interview with RT\u00c9 News on Tuesday.</p><p>In both, he called for a more active role for governments in regulation of social media and the internet.</p><p>His point, essentially, is that it shouldn\u2019t be up to private companies to define what speech is harmful, what constitutes political advertising, what privacy standards should be and how data can be moved around.</p><p>The Facebook boss is clear - governments should set those standards. </p><p>Companies like his should then find ways to meet them, should be transparent in whether they or not they achieve the goals, and presumably (although he doesn\u2019t say it explicitly) should be subject to sanction if they don\u2019t.</p><p>This represents something of a volte face from Facebook - a firm that has traditionally pushed back hard against government interference in its affairs, instead relying on self-regulation.</p><p>So what is behind this road to Damascus conversion? </p><p>The most benign interpretation would be that Zuckerberg realises that he was wrong.</p><p>Perhaps now that he is older, wiser and more mature than that Zuck who was pictured strolling nonchalantly down Grafton Street eight years ago, he realises he can no longer control the beast he inadvertently created as a teen in a dorm in Harvard.</p><p>Maybe he now sees that after all the scandals involving his and other social media and internet companies, regulation is inevitable.</p><p>And possibly he sees that he should now embrace the change, encourage it and in the process end up on the right side when the history of the development of social media is written in 30 years\u2019 time.</p><p>A less benign possibility also starts with Zuckerberg realising that regulation is going to happen, one way or another.</p><p>However, this view assumes that he and his team of advisors think that by getting out first, appearing to embrace the change, they may be able to temper and soften that regulation and shape it as it comes into being.</p><p>It was interesting, in that context, to note that Nick Clegg, the former Lib-Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister in the UK, who was appointed Facebook\u2019s Head of Global Affairs back in October, was by his boss\u2019 side during his visit to Dublin.</p><p>A seasoned politician, Mr Clegg presumably has a good sense of how best to handle this kind of politically charged debate and change.</p><p>The third possible view is that Facebook doesn't want any regulation, but is trying nonetheless to give the public and policy-makers a positive impression that it is open to it, via a charm offensive and PR campaign - an option that looks the least likely at this point in time.</p><p>Whatever the correct answer, there is little doubt that there is much at stake for Zuckerberg and his company, which is very much at a crossroads in its development.</p><p>Privacy regulators in most territories are breathing down its neck on multiple fronts.</p><p>Here, the Data Protection Commission has 15 statutory investigations under way at the moment, ten of which relate to Facebook, or its other platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg says he wants a more standardised data privacy regime across the world along the lines of the General Data Protection Regulation that recently came into force here.</p><p>But with that would come considerably more pressure on the company to move away from its old way of doing things, to a more privacy by design approach.</p><p>The company is also potentially facing anti-trust or competition challenges too.</p><p>Its proposal to merge its three messaging services into one common back-end platform has been met with concerned looks and skepticism in many quarters.</p><p>The EU, through Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, is increasingly coming down hard on big tech firms with massive fines and other remedies.</p><p>In the US, the talk now is of whether regulators should be considering going a step further by breaking up some of these firms in order to end their dominance.</p><p>When it comes to stopping election interference, Facebook has also clearly run out of road. </p><p>It has taken a large number of steps to prevent a repeat of the 2016 US Presidential Election where foreign actors manipulated the platform to try to influence the outcome.</p><p>Any more incidents like that though, where democracy is possibly undermined in any jurisdiction by misuse of Facebook user data, would be hugely, hugely damaging.</p><p>Clearly, based on what Mr Zuckerberg told me during our interview on Tuesday, he believes the social network is making progress in stopping such bad actors, but can\u2019t guarantee it can completely stop them.</p><p>And then there is the massive issue of safety on the platform, particularly where children are concerned.</p><p>The latest high-profile incident where Facebook was misused with devastating consequences in this way was the recent mass shooting in New Zealand, during which the gunman streamed his killing spree live on the social network.</p><p>It may have been an extreme case, but nearly every day there is some sort of controversy in the news about harmful material on a Facebook platform having a negative impact on users, especially children.</p><p>From hate speech to self-harm imagery, and cyber-bullying to violent extremism, it is a considerable problem.</p><p>In the medium to long-term, if the company doesn\u2019t sort these issues out, it could see not only users, but also advertisers, vote with their feet and leave.</p><p>It may also lead to personal pressure on Mr Zuckerberg to take a step back from running the company he founded and has led since day one, in order to let someone else try a different approach.</p><p>The challenges are, therefore, serious and many for Facebook and its leader right now.</p><p>So does Mark Zuckerberg really intend to change its direction to safeguard its future and continue its growth?</p><p>It is too early to say for sure. Actions will tell a lot.</p><p>Having spent some time with and around him last Tuesday, what is clear is that he is very clever, has thought deeply about the issues it faces and still appears to have a strong enough passion for his invention to want to put it right.</p><p>The big question now is, can he and will he?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1041008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTR-2D51-F16V-S2TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We looked at the numbers for evidence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>engulfed in scandals stemming from the abuse of its network, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2017/Q3/Q3'17-Earnings-Release.pdf\">promised to spend</url> large sums policing its operations, even if those outlays hurt the company\u2019s bottom line.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s first-quarter results, released on Wednesday, gave the public a chance to see if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is investing a lot more on cleaning up and securing its network. The company\u2019s profits did not suffer much in the quarter. The results did show that expenses went up, and a company executive said on a conference call that security spending in part drove the increases.</p><p>Still, the expense numbers did not provide clear evidence that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is going the extra mile to police its network. Stamping out abuse was not the only cause of <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s higher expenses \u2013 and the company\u2019s costs are more or less in proportion to the levels of past quarters. Here are some relevant numbers.</p><p> On the conference call, David Wehner, <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s C.F.O., highlighted a 51 percent increase in sales and marketing expense, the company\u2019s third-biggest expense item. One of the drivers of the increase was spending on protecting the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>community, he said. But there were other factors, he added, like spending on what he called innovation.</p><p> What is more, the sales and marketing expense was equivalent to 13 percent of revenue in the first quarter, the same share as a year ago. An increase in that percentage would bolster <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s claims that it is pulling out the stops to prevent misuse.</p><p> Cost of revenue expense, the second largest cost line, surged 66 percent in the first quarter, and it rose proportionately as well. In the first quarter, it was 16 percent of revenue, compared to 14 percent for the same period a year earlier.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s largest expense line, research and development, did not show an abnormal increase. It had a 22 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, slower than the 25 percent annual jump in the fourth quarter of 2017. It accounted for 19 percent of revenue in the first quarter, down from 23 percent in the same period a year ago.</p><p>If <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can. Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue, an impressive level of profitability that provides <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>with enough cash to finance a serious effort to minimize abuse. But it is still not clear that it\u2019s doing that.</p><p>- Peter Eavis</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s earnings by the numbers</p><p>The social network\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-data-privacy.html\">worst crisis</url> in its 14-year history is so far doing little to its bottom line, thanks to continued growth in its mobile advertising business.</p><p> Net income rose 63 percent to $4.99 billion, up from $3.06 billion a year ago.</p><p> Earnings per share came in at $1.69. Analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.</p><p> Revenue jumped 49 percent to 11.97 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $11.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</p><p> Mobile advertising revenue rose 50 percent to $11.8 billion.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>now has 1.45 billion daily users worldwide</p><p> Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada rose to 185 million in the first quarter.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>added about 70 million monthly users during the quarter.</p><p> Monthly active users in the U.S. and Canada increased to 241 million</p><p> It now has 2.2 billion users.</p><p> Average revenue per user rose to $5.53 from $4.23 a year ago.</p><p> Cost of revenue came in at 16 percent, compared with 14 percent during the first quarter of 2017.</p><p>Twitter is doing well abroad. But it\u2019s not clear where.</p><p>Twitter on Wednesday posted strong first-quarter results that were driven by an impressive performance outside of the United States. But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.</p><p>Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)</p><p>Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.</p><p>Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.</p><p>Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.</p><p>Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.</p><p>- Peter Eavis</p><p>What lies ahead for the race for Sky?</p><p>Comcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.</p><p>What\u2019s next?</p><p>Keep these dates in mind</p><p> On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.</p><p> By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.</p><p>In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant\u2019s relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.</p><p>About Fox/Disney raising their bid: It\u2019s an open question whether shareholders of those companies would support a bidding war.

By law, the consumer bureau has to collect those complaints. But it is not legally required to share them online.</p><p>Why finance institutions want it shut down</p><p>They say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.</p><p>Why consumer groups say that could be problematic</p><p>Consumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.</p><p>The bureau has used the complaints to spot patterns of bad behavior. A wave of complaints about Wells Fargo helped spur the agency\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-fined-for-years-of-harm-to-customers.html\">investigation and exposure of the bank\u2019s sham accounts</url>.

Revenue rose 21 percent to $665 million during the first quarter. User numbers rose slightly to 336 million per month.</p><p>Shares opened up 5 percent before tumbling more than 7 percent. The reason? T<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/twitter-gives-up-almost-all-of-its-13-percent-gain-after-earnings.html\">he company softened its outlook for the year</url>.</p><p>If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.</p><p>Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:</p><p>In the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.</p><p>Behind the fight over a key banking rule</p><p>Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/business/dealbook/bank-rules-leverage-ratio.html?dlbk\">Peter Eavis outlines</url> the arguments:</p><p>Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.</p><p>Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.</p><p>The political flyaround</p><p> A federal judge ruled that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/daca-dreamers-trump.html?dlbk\">the DACA program must continue</url> and accept new applications, because the Trump administration       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-rules-trump-administration-must-continue-daca-program-1524624398?dlbk\">didn\u2019t adequately justify</url> ending it.

We looked at the numbers for evidence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>engulfed in scandals stemming from the abuse of its network, has promised to spend large sums policing its operations, even if those outlays hurt the company's bottom line.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>first-quarter results, released on Wednesday, gave the public a chance to see if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is investing a lot more on cleaning up and securing its network. The company's profits did not suffer much in the quarter. The results did show that expenses went up, and a company executive said on a conference call that security spending in part drove the increases.</p><p>  Still, the expense numbers did not provide clear evidence that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is going the extra mile to police its network. Stamping out abuse was not the only cause of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>higher expenses -- and the company's costs are more or less in proportion to the levels of past quarters. Here are some relevant numbers.</p><p>   On the conference call, David Wehner, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>C.F.O., highlighted a 51 percent increase in sales and marketing expense, the company's third-biggest expense item. One of the drivers of the increase was spending on protecting the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>community, he said. But there were other factors, he added, like spending on what he called innovation.</p><p>   What is more, the sales and marketing expense was equivalent to 13 percent of revenue in the first quarter, the same share as a year ago. An increase in that percentage would bolster <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>claims that it is pulling out the stops to prevent misuse.</p><p>   Cost of revenue expense, the second largest cost line, surged 66 percent in the first quarter, and it rose proportionately as well. In the first quarter, it was 16 percent of revenue, compared to 14 percent for the same period a year earlier.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>largest expense line, research and development, did not show an abnormal increase. It had a 22 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, slower than the 25 percent annual jump in the fourth quarter of 2017. It accounted for 19 percent of revenue in the first quarter, down from 23 percent in the same period a year ago.</p><p>  If <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can. Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue, an impressive level of profitability that provides <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>with enough cash to finance a serious effort to minimize abuse. But it is still not clear that it's doing that.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>earnings by the numbers</p><p>  The social network's  worst crisis in its 14-year history is so far doing little to its bottom line, thanks to continued growth in its mobile advertising business.</p><p>   Net income rose 63 percent to $4.99 billion, up from $3.06 billion a year ago.</p><p>   Earnings per share came in at $1.69. Analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.</p><p>   Revenue jumped 49 percent to 11.97 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $11.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</p><p>   Mobile advertising revenue rose 50 percent to $11.8 billion.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>now has 1.45 billion daily users worldwide</p><p>   Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada rose to 185 million in the first quarter.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>added about 70 million monthly users during the quarter.</p><p>   Monthly active users in the U.S. and Canada increased to 241 million</p><p>   It now has 2.2 billion users.</p><p>   Average revenue per user rose to $5.53 from $4.23 a year ago.</p><p>   Cost of revenue came in at 16 percent, compared with 14 percent during the first quarter of 2017.</p><p/><p>Twitter is doing well abroad. But it's not clear where.</p><p>Twitter on Wednesday posted strong first-quarter results that were driven by an impressive performance outside of the United States. But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from -- and whether it can continue -- would have little company data with which to work.</p><p>Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)</p><p>Twitter's revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.</p><p>  Ned Segal, Twitter's chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.</p><p>  Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter ''highlights'' for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan's results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.</p><p>Twitter's stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p>  What lies ahead for the race for Sky?</p><p>Comcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox's year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.</p><p>  What's next?</p><p>  Keep these dates in mind</p><p>   On May 1, Britain's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox's bid should allowed to go through.</p><p>   By June 13 or so, Britain's culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox's offer.</p><p>  In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant's relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn't be too much of an issue.</p><p>  About Fox/Disney raising their bid: It's an open question whether shareholders of those companies would support a bidding war. Shares in Fox were up 2 percent as of midday Wednesday, while those in Disney were up 1 percent.</p><p>  -- Michael de la Merced</p><p>  The advisers in the scramble for Sky</p><p>  Putting together a nearly $31 billion takeover requires a fair amount of help. Here's who's working for Comcast and Sky -- and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.</p><p>Comcast</p><p>   Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by ''the two Simons.'' Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.</p><p>Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre</p><p>Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&amp;A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.</p><p>Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.</p><p>Sky</p><p>Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.</p><p>PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.</p><p>Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.</p><p>  Fox</p><p>Deutsche Bank, led by Gavin Deane, global co-head of T.M.T., and James Arculus, head of U.K. M.&amp;A.</p><p>Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop</p><p>Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&amp;A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans</p><p>JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&amp;A.</p><p>  -- Michael de la Merced</p><p>  The fight for Sky is officially on</p><p>  In formally making a 22 billion pound ($30.7 billion) bid for the British broadcaster, Comcast is challenging Rupert Murdoch for control of a crown jewel he wants dearly.</p><p>  How the offers stack up:</p><p>Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News's independence</p><p>   Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn't yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)</p><p>  Given the higher price of Comcast's bid, Sky withdrew its recommendation for Fox.</p><p>  The big questions: What will Fox and Disney do now? (Fox said it's considering its options.) And will anyone's shareholders -- apart from Sky's -- support a bidding war?</p><p>  In other big deal news: Shire said it's willing to recommend Takeda's new $64 billion takeover bid, which would be one of the biggest pharmaceutical deals of late. But shares in Takeda slumped, raising questions about whether Shire investors will agree.</p><p>  Another win for financial firms.</p><p>  Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's public database of complaints about their products and services.</p><p>  What's in the database</p><p>  Since 2011, the bureau has maintained an open, searchable record of more than one million consumer reports about inaccurate debt collections, illegal fees, improper overdraft charges, mistakes on loans and other problems. By law, the consumer bureau has to collect those complaints. But it is not legally required to share them online.</p><p>  Why finance institutions want it shut down</p><p>  They say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.</p><p>  Why consumer groups say that could be problematic</p><p>  Consumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.</p><p>  The bureau has used the complaints to spot patterns of bad behavior. A wave of complaints about Wells Fargo helped spur the agency's investigation and exposure of the bank's sham accounts. Complaints have also prompted actions against student loan servicers, debt collectors, mortgage lenders and credit card companies.</p><p>  More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.</p><p>Twitter's outlook spooks investors.</p><p>  The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.</p><p>Twitter reported a profit of $61 million, its second-straight profitable quarter. Revenue rose 21 percent to $665 million during the first quarter. User numbers rose slightly to 336 million per month.</p><p>  Shares opened up 5 percent before tumbling more than 7 percent. The reason? The company softened its outlook for the year.</p><p>  If those stock moves sound familiar, that's because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the ''high-water mark'' for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.</p><p>  Why such big moves? It's worth pointing back to what DealBook's Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:</p><p>  ''Despite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&amp;P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&amp;P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&amp;P. 500's earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.''</p><p>  In the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.</p><p>  Behind the fight over a key banking rule</p><p>  Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.</p><p>  Peter Eavis outlines the arguments:</p><p>  Why relax the rule? It's making it too hard for banks to do business. ''The best analogy is that it's like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,'' Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.</p><p>  Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there's another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise.

It can feel that way, with the social network on Tuesday officially unveiling Libra, its new digital currency that's backed by a number of major companies, including Mastercard and Spotify. Libra, which has been in the works for more than a year and is still not expected to launch until early 2020, has analysts falling over themselves this week to laud Facebook. But Charlie Shrem, one of bitcoin's earliest evangelists and currently the host of the cryptocurrency-focused podcast 'Untold Stories,' said the move is unlikely to bump bitcoin from the top of the digital currency market. </p><p>'I don't see it as a bitcoin killer,' Shrem told TheWrap, 'I see it as an alternative.' '[Facebook is] going to play it as the 'safe bitcoin,'' he continued. 'They're going to say bitcoin is volatile, and this is anti-volatile because it's pegged against all these different currencies. 'Bitcoin is unsafe, bitcoin is shady,' they're going to say all these things, and [Libra] is going to compete with bitcoin's market share.' Also Read: Is Facebook's New Privacy Bet a 'Masterstroke' by Mark Zuckerberg?[1] Facebook's white paper[2] released Tuesday said the world needs a 'reliable digital currency.' Here are five key points to keep in mind about Libra: 1. Libra will be built on blockchain technology. Blockchain essentially stacks transactions on top of each other and allows users to go back and view them later. The Libra blockchain will be managed, at least from the start, by the companies behind the currency. Each company invested at least $10 million to have a say in Libra's governance. The white paper said it wants to eventually move towards having more nodes, or validators, as part of its blockchain governance \u2014 something that'll make it increasingly decentralized. 2. Libra will be governed by an independent association based in Switzerland. Founding members include Visa and Uber. Altogether, there are 28 founding members right now, and Facebook said it wants to hit 100 backers by the time the currency launches next year. Libra's coalition of independent governors removes any user fears Facebook alone will control the currency, and attaches recognizable brand names to the product \u2014 something it hopes will lend immediate credibility to the operation. Bitcoin's digital ledger is different, in that it's maintained by a network of users that verify all transactions on its blockchain, rather than having companies or a governing body confirm transactions. 3. Privacy is key. After a myriad of highly-publicized data security issues in the last 18 months, Facebook clearly understands its track record may scare users away from Libra. To assuage some of those fears, Facebook has launched Calibra, a subsidiary company, 'to ensure separation between social and financial data.' In other words: Libra payments will never be used by Facebook to hit users with targeted ads. 'Calibra will be regulated like other payment service providers. Any information you share with Calibra will be kept separate from information you share on Facebook,' Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said in a Tuesday post[3]. Facebook will not import contact information or other profile details, but may request Libra users do so on their own. Also Read: Millennials Ride the Bitcoin Rollercoaster: 'I Just Did It Kind of Blindly'[4] 4. Libra's value will be tied to a number of assets, including the dollar, pound and euro. Users will be able to buy Libra through Calibra, Facebook's digital wallet, or other online wallets. The goal is to create a stable digital currency that allows billions of people to send quick payments for a small fee (something that hasn't been finalized, yet, but is likely to cost a fraction of a cent) or buy products online. 'It's a good bet on Facebook's part,' Michael Queller, a Los Angeles-based securities trader, told TheWrap. 'It's really much different than any cryptocurrency in play. Unlike all the current coins that are fluctuating in value based on market supply and demand, [Libra] is going to be linked to a basket of currencies, and their goal is to make it where the value doesn't fluctuate anymore than the dollar does.' Stability has not been synonymous with digital currencies. Most bitcoin headlines center on the currency's wild increases and decreases in value \u2014 something that was particularly evident during the second half of 2017, when bitcoin rushed from about $3,000 per coin to $20,000 per coin in less than six months. By avoiding rapid price swings, Libra can attract users that are intrigued by digital currencies but are put off by volatility. It also gives users that live in countries with unstable currencies or the 1.7 billion people that do not have a bank account access to a secure, stable digital currency, Libra's white paper explained. 'We believe a Facebook cryptocurrency-based payments system could be especially useful in countries with high inflation/unstable banking systems and for cross-country remittances,' MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in a note to investors. 'So, Facebook's commerce ambitions do not appear to be limited to developed markets. Rather, Facebook has its eyes set on becoming the world's leading ecommerce platform as well.' 5. Facebook hopes Libra will become its own version of PayPal for users. Of course, this is more than an altruistic endeavor on behalf of Zuckerberg and the rest of the companies backing Libra. Think of the Libra-Facebook relationship as 'what PayPal is to eBay,' Queller explained, where users are seamlessly able to buy products from Facebook Marketplace using their digital money. And more time spent browsing Facebook also means more time to hit users with ads, something David Marcus, the company's VP of blockchain, told TechCrunch[5]. 'If more commerce happens, then more small businesses will sell more on and off platform, and they'll want to buy more ads on the platform so it will be good for our ads business,' Marcus said. RBC analyst Mark Mahaney was even more bullish than Nathanson, saying in a note to investors Libra could potentially be 'one of the most important initiatives in the history' of Facebook, boosting the company's payment, commerce and gaming businesses.

Bitcoin loyalists remain dubious about Facebook's foray with Libra Shrem, however, remains highly skeptical that Libra will make bitcoin, the grandaddy of digital currency, obsolete. Facebook's venture, according to Shrem, undermines two core principles of bitcoin: Immutabiltity, since all bitcoin transactions are finalized and unable to be reversed, and control by a network of users rather than the financial and corporate powerhouses that are behind Libra. (Bitcoin, it's worth pointing out, was born in the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis.) 'Bitcoin is a social experiment,' Shrem said. 'It was created to be a censorship-resistent system to send value or information over the internet, where one single party or parties cannot have control over other people. And Facebook, what they're calling their cryptocurrency, is not that.' Shrem and Queller agree that both Libra and bitcoin 'can work in harmony' together. 'If anything, Libra is going to be a little bit of a boost for bitcoin because it's just proving the whole concept of blockchain,' Queller said.Related stories from TheWrap: Is Bitcoin Dead?

The...</p><p>On August 3, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) closed its comment period for proposed rules on \u2018National Bank and Federal Savings Association Digital Activities\u2019, and of the 90 responses received, one was from a company called \u2018Novi\u2019. The website for Novi describes its mission as \u2018A connected wallet for a connected world\u2019. With the exception of the symbol within the \u2018o\u2019 of the company, it may be very easy to skim past this letter and not realize this is actually a comment letter from a new subsidiary of Facebook  FB  that was formerly called \u2018Calibra\u2019.        The full comment letter is one page and at the end is unsigned and unnamed, with only an address at the bottom of the letterhead: 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025. According to the Better Business Bureau\u2019s website , this address represents the headquarters of Facebook. The letter, with no reference to its connection to Facebook, notes, \u201cNovi Financial was founded with the mission of making payments work better for everyone. We believe that national banks equally should have the ability to participate and compete in making payments work better for everyone, whether using traditional payment methods, or cryptoassets and distributed ledger technology.\u201d    David Marcus is the Head of Novi Financial (formerly Calibra), and also sits on the Board of Directors for the Libra Association. Interestingly, as a response to the high level of public interest and scrutiny by Congress when Libra was announced, Marcus wrote in a blog post last year about the goal of helping the unbanked and the inherent unfairness of the banking system. \u201cThe current system is designed in such a way that if your balance falls below a certain threshold, you\u2019re charged fees you can\u2019t afford...With Libra, anyone with a $40 smartphone and connectivity will have the ability to securely safeguard their assets, access the world economy, transact at a much lower cost and over time, access a whole range of financial services\u201d.          Novi further explains that based on its belief in innovation unlocking value in the economy, we have \u2018prioritized educating stakeholders on how technologies such as distributed ledgers and stablecoins can work with, and within, the financial services sector.\u2019    However, there is no reference in the letter to how the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had made commitments to Congress in looking to achieve regulatory approval prior to launching Libra. After a letter from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee issued in May kicked off interest in the upcoming Libra project last year, where the letter stated, \u2018...it is important to understand how large social platforms make data available that can be used in ways that have big implications for consumers\u2019 financial lives.\u2019, the new Libra project underwent intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill.    This scrutiny included Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) of the House Financial Services Committee  CBFV  in calling on Facebook to \u2018halt its development\u2019 of Libra until Congress had a chance to better examine the policy implications of Big Tech becoming involved in banking. There was even a bill introduced by Representative Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (IL-04) that was called the \u2018Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\u2019 (H.R. 4813). His ball calls for an outright prohibition on, \u201ccertain large technology companies (e.g., social media platforms) from offering financial services. Specifically, these companies may not be a financial institution; be affiliated with a financial institution; or establish, maintain, or operate a digital currency\u201d.    While many in Congress had hard questions for both Marcus and Zuckerberg last year, some in the House of Representatives drilled down on the commitment of the Facebook CEO as to whether he really would wait for full regulatory approval from all the regulators before moving forward with Libra in the United States.    As explained by Novi, the origin of its name is derived from the Latin words \u2018novus\u2019 for new and \u2018via\u2019 for way, which together mean \u2018new way\u2019. The outstanding question for Facebook would appear to be now whether this letter indicates its humility and willingness to work with regulators, or whether it has devised a \u2018new way\u2019 of becoming a bank.

But it also raises questions about privacy and Google's dominance in the tech industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The announcement Friday came with a promise that Google won't sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.</p><p>San Francisco-based Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display phone messages and notifications.</p><p>They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit's app to record what they eat and how much water they drink, or to track their periods.</p><p>Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers' wearable devices, but those products haven't gained much traction. And Google doesn't sell a device of its own.</p><p>The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a boost.</p><p>\"Google doesn't want to be left out of the party,\" said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. \"If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it's a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.\"</p><p>Google's pledge not to sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.</p><p>Privacy experts, though, were skeptical.</p><p>Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn expressed concern that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.</p><p>\"While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,\" Mendelsohn said.</p><p>Google's promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.</p><p>For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users' locations. That could help Google know, for example, that a runner stopped at a coffee shop after a workout. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.</p><p>More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.</p><p>The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.</p><p>\"Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they're under [Justice Department] antitrust investigation?\" tweeted Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).</p><p>Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit's relatively small size and its focus on hardware.</p><p>Although Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.</p><p>When rumors of a potential buyout by Google surfaced this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. On Friday it jumped an additional 15.5% to $7.14 a share.</p><p>Google agreed to pay $7.35 a share. Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., rose 1.1%.</p><p>Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major healthcare companies such as Humana Inc. to encourage healthier living.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: JAMEY POWELL, left, and Julianne Hough lead an exercise class in New York in which participants are introduced to a fitness tracker.

FacebookFB[1], MicrosoftMSFT[2], Amazon AMZN[3], AppleAAPL[4], NetflixNFLX[5] and AlphabetGOOGL[6] are not just large cap stocks. They are up a respective 17.0%, 33.6%, 65.4%, 27.3%, 52.6% and 11.9% year to date while the S&amp;#38;P 500 is down 2.7%.Obviously, the pandemic-induced digitization has served them well. People have had more time (and inclination) to connect and sell on Facebook, watch movies on Netflix, listen to Apple's Music, play games on Xbox, read books bought on Amazon and catch their daily dose of infotainment on YouTube.While kickbacks for smaller ecommerce players like eBayEBAY[7] and Shopify SHOP[8] continue, Amazon of course gained big time.Those among the FMAANG with working tools like Azure, Office, AWS, Google Cloud, Macs, Chromebooks and smartphone solutions also gained.Moreover, since the pandemic was a global feature and all of these companies are global suppliers, the benefits were multiplied.Regulatory concerns are however weighing down these stocks. </p><p>In particular, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook are scheduled to answer questions from a government antitrust committee on Jul 27. There's also growing bipartisan support for amendments to Section 230, which has thus far protected companies with online platforms like Facebook and YouTube from prosecution for objectionable content on their platforms. FacebookThe social media company has gotten itself into the middle of a deep controversy about the content it allows on its platform and the people/organizations it allows as fact checkers. This has led some of its larger advertisers to temporarily quit the platform, as pressure from human rights groups continues to mount.But the issue also brought to light the broad base of Facebook advertisers that make a Facebook boycott somewhat ineffective. Some have estimated that these large companies contribute around 5% of its advertising revenue. The rest comes from a large number of small and medium-sized sellers, who have already spent time and money building their relationships and businesses on the platform. Their investment in the platform makes this customer base extremely sticky, especially because of the need for a digital front in the current operating climate. As a result, Facebook stock has been somewhat resilient to the pressure.Its numbers also look good. The company is expected to grow earnings 11.8% this year and 34.2% in 2021, despite a downward revision to estimates in the last 7 days (to account for the shift in big spenders). Its surprise history is spotty, averaging -10.2% in the last four quarters.However, the June quarter Zacks Earnings ESP[9] (Expected Surprise Prediction), which compares the Zacks Consensus Estimate to the Most Accurate Estimate, is positive. This generally happens when the most recent estimates are higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. If the Zacks Rank for a stock with positive ESP is #3 (Hold) or higher, there are good chances of a positive surprise when it reports on Jul 29.Facebook shares are currently ranked #3. So if the ESP remains positive going into the announcement, sending shares higher, it would make sense to buy the shares.MicrosoftWhile catering to the growing demand for its work-related tools, including its communication and collaboration software, Microsoft is venturing out into new areas.In May for example, it launched Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, which it said was a 'first of many\" custom cloud offerings with the stated goal of improving overall health outcomes. It was not unexpected given the challenges thrown up by the pandemic, but it's good to see the company grab new opportunity.It was also recently reported that Microsoft is in the market to acquire AT&amp;#38;T's WB Games (the Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment unit). This will add to its already considerably large stable of games and boost gaming revenues.There was a bit of negative news flow about plans to shut down its retail operations, but these were never really that significant for Microsoft, so they're unlikely to have much of an impact on its results.Microsoft's numbers are encouraging-It is expected to grow earnings 20.0% this year and 9.4% in the next. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both years has edged up in the past week. While the company has consistently topped the Zacks Consensus in the last four quarters at an average rate of 12.1%, its negative ESP for June quarter earnings is a slight concern at this point. However, the ESP is a fluid number, so it's worth keeping an eye on as the company heads into its fourth-quarter earnings announcement on Jul 16.Microsoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3, so if the ESP turns positive it would make sense to accumulate the shares.AppleApple's business is still dependent on its cash cow, the iPhone. But the company continues to build the installed base of devices, which naturally has positive implications for its burgeoning services business. Not only that, it is one of the most successful wearables companies, a market it conquered by coming up from behind.And as far as the iPhone is concerned, this is a quiet period despite the launch of the low-end gen 2 SE in China and India. The party will really begin in the second half, after it launches the new flagship device because some of the installed base is pretty old and it's past time for an upgrade.So while there's likely to be a negative pandemic impact as well, it's probably too soon to go bearish on Apple, since like the others, it too has benefited from the rapid digitization, work from home and other trends. The picture should be clearer after the company reports on Aug 4.The numbers definitely don't look too bad with earnings expected to grow 3.6% this year and 23.8% in the next. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 stock has edged higher over the past week. The surprise history is decidedly positive with the preceding four quarters' surprise averaging 10.6%. The ESP indicator hasn't done well with respect to this stock.AmazonAmazon's success is tied to its leadership position in retail ecommerce and cloud infrastructure markets, both of which were beneficiaries of the pandemic.Even when some markets allowed shipment of essentials alone, the fact that traditional retailers were mostly closed made this a roaring business for the company. It's extremely unlikely for Amazon to lose any ground that it has gained because it has a history of being extraordinarily good at retaining customers. So sure, smaller marketplaces may have gained too, but Amazon is likely to be the long term champ.And this goes for the cloud business as well. Those altering modus operandi for the pandemic are investing in new tech. So they too are unlikely to jump away quickly. Let's take a look at the numbers. While double-digit revenue growth is forecasted for both 2020 and 2021, earnings are expected to drop 13.1% this year before nearly doubling to $38.40 next year. This is likely because infrastructure has to be scaled up very rapidly within a short timeframe to accommodate the significantly higher level of demand.Amazon's surprise history is spotty because the company typically doesn't say much about the timing of investments, which makes it harder to model results. But it currently has an uncharacteristically positive ESP for June quarter results that it will report on Jul 23. So let's see. The shares carry a Zacks Rank #3.NetflixThe Netflix story is similar to the others, with the first quarter already seeing a subscriber addition of 16 million and low levels of churn (comparable to periods before the price increase). The international business remains the major contributor and also the area where it is investing heavily. Management expects second quarter subscriber adds to be 7.5 million, which is also up from last year. The second half is expected to decline as stay-at-home orders phase out.comScore data shows that Netflix remains the top streaming app in terms of at-home numbers of hours viewed. Netflix grew its share 1.5 points to 26.7% in a market where the top five account for around 80% market share. Engagement should remain strong as management has already said that it doesn't anticipate any disruption in content supply for the rest of the year.Analysts have started speculating about whether there could be another price hike given the growing levels of engagement, despite increasing competition from YouTube, Hulu, Amazon Video and Disney+. In fact, Cowen &amp;#38; Co. analysts led by John Blackledge, in their monthly survey of about 2,500 U.S. consumers, concluded that 55% don't mind a price hike, up from 47% in December. Also 60% of respondents streaming more than 7 hours a week don't mind a price hike, up from 52%. The analysts think there could be an opportunity to raise prices in 2021 or 2022. However, price increases may not be possible if the employment situation doesn't improve.The company is expected to grow earnings 55.7% in 2020 and 34.7% in 2021. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is up a penny in the last 7 days. The average positive surprise in the four preceding quarters is 48.7% despite the fact that there was a small miss in the last quarter. Heavy investment in content has led to a huge debt load, resulting in a negative net cash position and a debt cap ratio of 62.8%.The Zacks Rank #3 stock has a positive ESP, so a positive surprise is expected when it reports results on Jul 16.AlphabetThe last of the sprawling tech stocks is Alphabet, has seen some benefits from the pandemic. But with governments across the world trying to disrupt its dominance and the American government attempting the same, sentiments on the stock have started dwindling. The only positive, if it materializes at all, is a gain from Facebook's fallout with large advertisers. But since most big companies split budgets between platforms, any gain is uncertain, especially in the current soft environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 shows an earnings decline of 16.1% this year, followed by a 33.1% increase in the next although revenue is expected to increase in both years. Both 2020 and 2021 estimates dropped half a point in the last 7 days. In the last four quarters the company topped estimates as often as it missed although it averaged +4.9%.Although the ESP for the June quarter is positive, the shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 and are therefore not recommended at this time.Zacks' Single Best Pick to Double From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each picked their favorite to gain +100% or more in months to come.

Your soul deserves some respite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But suffice to say, and combined with his valiant final column for the Washington Post, Khashoggi's death might well have you running up the \"free speech\" flag above any other this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What the Arab world needs most is free expression\", goes the headline in the Post. Khashoggi quietly measures the distance between the Arab Spring and current conditions. These resemble \"the Arab World's version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power\".</p><p>Speaking freely has always had its costs. The recent spike of unexplained murders and disappearances of journalists across the globe is pretty clearly correlated with the rise of authoritarian and right-wing populist regimes.</p><p>Facing these lethal situations, the link between free communication and healthy society seems as valid as it was in the era of Milton or John Stuart Mill, let alone the classical Greek polis.</p><p>Yet this is not only a problem for \"those over there\", living beyond some liberal-modern boundary. As I'm sure you've noticed, the elected head of the United States regularly cheers on the abuse of journalists. In the past few days, indeed, Trump celebrated the physical roughing-up of a journalist last year.</p><p>Also this week, the UK Government's counter-terrorism Bill was accused of infringing free speech, by Westminster's cross-party human rights committee.</p><p>The committee's report states: \"We are particularly concerned that a sentence of 15 years could be imposed for a precursor offence of viewing terrorist material online three times or more ... this could jeopardise legitimate research, for example by academics or journalists, or individuals accessing material out of curiosity.\"</p><p>It's striking how proposals like this sneak into your daily actions as a citizen, and set you wondering whether you're crossing a line or not. Here's my example.</p><p>There's an essay I have long bookmarked, and reread regularly. It's titled \"Battle lines: want to understand the jihadis? Read their poetry\", from the New Yorker, June 8-15, 2015.</p><p>The piece undoubtedly delivers.</p><p>It maps out the idealism and heroism - expressed in jihadi verse taken from radicalising websites - that guides young men (and some young women) into extremism.</p><p>But am I now to pause the next time I access it, or ping it to a friend or colleague - lest the national-security algorithms catch me mistakenly? That feels very wrong.</p><p>The UK Government's response, expectedly, points to the string of domestic jihadist attacks on British soil in recent years. The justification for their proposals of near-total surveillance of digital traffic, endlessly sifting the Cloud for clues, is a mound of innocent corpses.</p><p>At the height of the Irish Troubles, Thatcher tried to rob the IRA of the \"oxygen of publicity\" by muting their speaking voices on the nightly news. Yet we have been a fully networked society for about a decade now. Everyone, no matter their values, is potentially the newsreader at the desk of their own social media app.</p><p>You'd have thought the cybercat of free speech - or at least our expectation that it's the norm - is mostly out of the bag. I wonder, though. When it comes to the crunch, how deep in the marrow will we value these new powers of self-expression?</p><p>When restrictions on \"acceptable\" communications start to tighten, and the technology develops to enforce them, will we rouse ourselves to defend our digital free speech rights? Or will there, alternatively, be an exhausted sigh of acceptance? That someone, somewhere, is putting a boundary round the shitstorm?</p><p>Scotland has been mildly rehearsing some of these scenarios. In April this year, the Scottish Government's own Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 was repealed by a coalition of Holyrood political forces, in the face of majority polls for its retention.</p><p>Before the Act, online communications came under the same law as offline. The bulk of the opposition's argument was that conviction was particularly difficult to ensure on the law's own terms. The material at hand often involved interpretable matters of history, culture and \"satirical\" performance.</p><p>In the classic words of free speech advocates, might not one answer to the \"bad\" speech of sectarian division be \"more\" (and better) speech, in order to persuade and change minds? Is criminalising the expressed passions of historically defined sports communities really the best way of calming them down?</p><p>The second case - just about on my own doorstep - was that of Coatbridge's Count Dankula (real name: Markus Meechan). He was successfully convicted in April of this year, at Airdrie Sheriff Court, of \"hate crime\" (according to the Communications Act, 2003).</p><p>You'll remember this took the form of a YouTube video, where Meechan had trained his pug dog to raise its paw in salute, responding to the injunctions \"Seig Heil\" and \"Gas the Jews\".</p><p>Hallelujah! There's the wonders that can be achieved with technologies that enable \"more\" speech against \"bad\" speech. Praise be, and pass the off switch.</p><p>Yet when you watch Dankula's post again, after the furore has subsided (and noting how he frames his video as \"a way to annoy his girlfriend\"), it seems to me that the Court erred in its conviction.</p><p>A conviction which made Meechan a cause celebre for neofascists like Tommy Robinson.</p><p>In short: it's hard to imagine a law which penalises Dankula, but allows (say) Mel Brooks's The Producers to maraud across regional theatre stages. Is \"Springtime for Hitler\" any less pointedly, determinedly offensive than Meechan's goofball routines?</p><p>But old schlockmeisters like Brooks were squeezing their satire through a Hollywood production system, with every possibility of commercial oblivion. They weren't directly feeding into a massively automated system that derives direct profit from eternal, everyday outrage - all these interactions sold to advertisers as audience research.</p><p>As Zeynep Tufekci said earlier this year in Wired magazine's free-speech special, \"shit-talkers\" like Dankula are core to the business model of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. These companies \"regard all speech - whether it's a breaking news story, a saccharine animal video, an anti-Semitic meme, or a clever advertisement for razors - as just \"content\". Each post just another slice of pie on the carousel\".</p><p>Tufekci continues: \"The economics underlying the Big Tech platforms - harvesting attention with a massive surveillance infrastructure to allow for targeted, mostly automated advertising at very large scale - is far too compatible with authoritarianism, propaganda, misinformation and polarisation.\"</p><p>If this can be stated so clearly, we can hopefully imagine and execute reforms. But who will kick them off? As ever, Scottish independence is an opportunity - in this regulatory and legal jurisdiction, at least - to experiment with solutions.</p><p>Never was the ambition for us to be \"a wee bit better than over the Border\" so inadequate. If a second Scottish Enlightenment is at all imaginable, it will be because it gets its teeth into this stuff.</p><p>In his last article for the Washington Post, Jamal Khashoggi dreamed of \"a modern version of old transnational media\", distributing professionally produced news, by which \"ordinary people in the Arab world be able to address the structural problems their societies face\".</p><p>Good idea. Let's really be bothered about speech, freedom, technology and regulation, if we Scots get the chance to be fully engaged in the world. Complex world: many to help, much to do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THENTL-16996005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THENTL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THX-SGJ1-F0JC-M15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437379</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The National (Scotland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51662\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 20, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000761</classCode><className>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode><className>Freedom of Speech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY</classCode><className>Murder</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D8CB</classCode><className>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEM2NUFFNTAyOTEwNDdBQkE4MTJFMDM1QTdCNzBCNTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode><className>Expressive Conduct</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ</classCode><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001996</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

If this was truly the primary business of Goldman Sachs(NYSE:GS)  and its peers today, perhaps people would look at these banks as contributing to society (by helping businesses grow) rather than picking the pockets of society (e.g, high frequency trading, packaging worthless securities and generally not creating anything useful). But I digress.</p><p><br/><br/>The question I thought of today is whether the U.S. markets and investment banks are becoming somewhat obsolete (or perhaps, totally obsolete). Do companies need to go public anymore to raise capital? And if companies dont need the stock market to raise capital, then what purpose does the stock market really serve?<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>COMPARING FACEBOOKWITH GOOGLE(NASDAQ:GOOG)  AND MICROSOFT (NASDAQ:MSFT) <br/><br/>Facebooktoday is what Googlewas in the 00s and Microsoft was in the 80s and 90s. Yet, Facebookcontinues to raise series after series of capital from various venture capital firms. Holders of Facebookstock can even cash out using private exchanges such as SecondMarket. Likewise, while much smaller, Twitter continues to raise round after round. Then there is Groupon. The company passed on a $5 billion buyout from Google(nobody knows the act figure, but it was a lot). <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/28/groupon-closing-950-million-round-valued-at-4-75-billion/\">It seemed a little nuts until Groupon raised $950 million of capital from venture capital funds at a $4.5 billion valuation.</url> No IPO needed.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>BIG TECH PROVIDES THE FINAL LIQUIDITY EVENT FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES<br/><br/>Ultimately, a company such as Facebookmay still need to issue an IPO to provide a liquidity event for its shareholders. It is unlikely that private markets are robust enough to provide liquidity for its stockholders. Or perhaps this assumption is incorrect? Companies such as Apple and Googleare sitting on billions and billions of cash and have nothing to do with it other than to buy smaller companies that augment their existing businesses. In my opinion, the dream exit is no longer an IPO. Why deal with all the hassle, expense and regulation? The dream exit is to sell out to a large tech company like Apple or Google. You either get cash or you exchange the stock in your emerging company for Apple or Googlestock and cash it out in the stock market. There is your liquidity event.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>INFORMATION FLOW PLUS CHEAP MONEY = NO NEED\u00a0 LESS OF A NEED FOR PUBLIC MARKETS<br/><br/>In my opinion, pools of private money (venture capital and private equity funds) have grown tremendously because of two factors.<br/><br/>The first factor Ill term as \u0153information flow. Peoples networks have grown because of technology. Travel is cheap. Meeting someone on the Internet (for example, through LinkedIn) and building the relationship into a real world relationship is now commonplace. It is much easier for people with money to find places to park their wealth today because of enhanced information flow. Likewise, because of technology, fund managers have larger social networks today making it easier to raise funds. Founders and entrepreneurs have open channels of communication with VCs (think Fred Wilson at AVC.com). My point is that investors, fund managers and entrepreneurs (the required parties)\u00a0 can connect much easier than they could even five or ten years ago. While junior rounds of financings always needed VCs, there are now a lot more players available for senior rounds. Perhaps it is a consortium of funds or it might be a VC arm of Google. And because of information flow, all of these players know how to find each other. The improvement of information flow makes it much easier to aggregate capital.<br/><br/>The second factor causing less reliance on public markets is that money is cheap (ie., inflated).       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogmaverick.com/2010/08/20/the-stock-market-is-still-for-suckers-and-why-you-should-put-your-money-in-the-bank/\">I agree with Mark Cuban in that capital is cheap</url>. Money is losing its scarcity. While the \u0153average joe has been hit by the recession, many individuals and companies (again, think Apple and Google) are flushed with boat loads of cash and cant find anything to do with it. All of this money is going into funds and the pools of money available are large. I would argue that money is becoming more concentrated as well. This reduces the utility of a public intermediary such as a stock market since less people are needed for a capital raise.<br/><br/>In the old days, a company such as Facebook, Twitter or Groupon would grow to a certain point and there simply wouldnt be any more money available in the private markets. At this point, the company calls up an underwriter such as Goldman to market the company for an IPO. The company takes the cash from the IPO and uses it to expand the business.<br/><br/>Were not seeing this step anymore (at least not for the really good deals). The public markets are needed less and less because the pools of private money are so large.<br/><br/>BUT WONT FACEBOOKand TWITTER EVENTUALLY IPO?<br/><br/>Assuming they dont get gobbled up by a big tech company flushed with cash, I believe they will IPO. Unfortunately, the purpose of the IPO will not be to raise capital for development. There are plenty of private funds available for that. Instead, the real purpose of the IPO will be a liquidity event for the investors in the company. While it doesnt mean the IPO wont be a good buy, I do believe it reduces the chances. I would much rather buy an IPO where the company is booming and needs a boat load of cash from the public markets for infrastructure (think of Googleand all the computer equipment) than a company that has ample cash but needs a liquidity event for its investors.<br/><br/>Why is the smart money selling? In a conventional IPO context (similar to founders and early round investors), a good answer is \u0153we need more money to grow the business. But if you can get money from the private markets, why sell to the public now? When I think of Facebookgoing public, this worries me.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>This is the long way of saying that the combination of technology and cheap money has created private pools of money with large amounts of capital. The stock market used to be the only game in town for raising a lot of capital. At least for the best deals (Facebook, Twitter, Groupon), the public markets are no longer needed to grow companies.<br/><br/>This might mean that the quality of IPOs will decline. IPOs will either be liquidity events (rather than capital raising events) or will be IPOs of companies that were passed on by the large private pools of capital.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it also means the stock market is much more of a gambling hall today than a place to raise capital for growing businesses. We know at least some of the \u0153social good and \u0153Gods work has moved from the public exchanges into private channels.<br/><br/> Newstex ID: CHCF-5505-52160039  <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-newstexCHCF-5505-52160039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHCF-5505</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51TS-GGH1-F03R-N2F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><timeReceived>1:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2010 Charts and Coffee</copyright><publicationName>Charts and Coffee</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>December 29, 2010 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CTKS</classCode><className>SECONDMARKET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000CPCV</classCode><className>GROUPON INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He was an inventor and had made his fortune creating a mechanism to release drinks from vending machines. It was a blissful time, both for her and for American business, she recalls. In the 1950s and 60s, \"business had integrity. Those companies barely exist any more.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That sense of loss clearly lies behind Ms Zuboff's latest book, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\". For the work of a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, it is written with unusual outrage. Its arch-villain is Google, a company as far removed from a blue-collar production line as can be imagined. It sweeps beyond business to society at large, where it warns of an \"overthrow of the people's sovereignty\" by the surveillance capitalists. Clearly the halcyon days of her youth, when America's big business was trusted, are long gone. Her zeal recalls that of another writer yearning for a lost past; Ida Tarbell, whose journalism helped end the monopoly of John Rockefeller, the oil baron who ruined her father. But as muckraking goes, Ms Zuboff lays it on too thick.</p><p>To be sure, this is a good time to draw attention to the dark forces at work on-screen. Surveillance capitalism, a phrase Ms Zuboff coined in 2014, is a good way of explaining the Faustian bargain at the heart of the digital economy: the services that users enjoy free of charge are costing them more than they think. It describes the compulsion Silicon Valley's data-gatherers have to mine ever larger portions of people's daily existence\u2014how they shop, exercise or socialise\u2014to turn into products that predict and shape their behaviour.</p><p>She argues that users are sleepwalking into this new world of \"smart\" devices and smart cities, created more for the benefit of those who hoover up their data than for them. In order to get the best use out of their robo-vacuum cleaner, or \"sleep-tracking\" mattresses, or internet-enabled rectal thermometers, they consent to surrendering their most intimate details, not realising these are put up for sale in \"behavioural futures markets\". Beyond the home, little do they know how their phone doubles as a tracking device, enabling firms to geotag them for advertisements. More Americans used apps that required location data in 2015 than those who listened to music or watched videos on their phones, she notes. Because all this is unprecedented, it is ill-defined in law and regulation. Actions against monopoly and privacy do not quite cut it. </p><p>In this drama Google makes for a compelling evil genius. It started life as a force for good. In 1998 its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, wrote a landmark paper explicitly warning that advertising-led search engines would be biased against the true needs of consumers. But their idealism was coshed by the dotcom crash of 2000-01, which forced them to turn a profit. Like Tarbell combing through Standard Oil's court documents, Ms Zuboff picks apart Google's patent applications to find evidence of its switch to surveillance as the means for its power grab. It was transformed from a \"youthful Dr Jekyll into a ruthless, muscular Mr Hyde, determined to hunt his prey anywhere, any time\", she writes.</p><p>Several factors need to be taken into account, however, before reaching such a damning verdict on Google, Facebook or any of the tech companies in her sights. First, in her 691-page book she barely mentions the benefits of Google's products, such as search, maps and Gmail. No company has taken the age-old tools of discovery and communication\u2014quests, voyages and messages\u2014and made them more widely available. It may be true, as Apple's Tim Cook has said, that \"if the service is 'free', you are not the customer but the product\". But arguably, only religions do a better job of providing something for nothing. In a sign that people value \"free\" stuff despite the surveillance costs, a National Bureau of Economic Reseach paper has calculated that users of search engines would need to be paid over $1,000 a month to give up access to the service.</p><p>Second, if people become fed up with Google's tactics, they can always switch. DuckDuckGo, a smaller search engine, assures users that it does not track them. A competitive market for digital privacy is heating up. Amid all the potentially creepy internet-of-things devices at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Apple made privacy a marketing pitch with its ad: \"What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.\" Ad blockers and subscription services, such as Netflix, are a reminder that advertising's stranglehold is not invincible. As Tim Wu says in his book \"The Attention Merchants\", popular revolt has often been triggered when advertising becomes too intrusive. There is eventually a political reaction, too. Witness the congressional grillings of Facebook when the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced. The political furore is one reason why its share price has slumped.</p><p>But in a book that calls surveillance capitalism \"a threat to human nature in the 21st century\", perhaps the biggest shortcoming is taking the genius of Silicon Valley\u2014evil or not\u2014too seriously. One of Ms Zuboff's sharpest criticisms is of \"inevitablism\": the belief, from Karl Marx to the tech giants, that Utopia can be predicted with certainty\u2014in tech's case, that \"everything will be connected\". </p><p>Others, too, find this unconvincing. In his book \"Life After Google\", George Gilder notes that, since Marx, intellectuals have often erred in thinking that their own eras were the final stage of human history, ie, that they had reached the peak of human achievement. The tech titans do too, he says, not least because this serves to endorse the significance of \"their own companies, of their own special philosophies and chimeras\u2014of themselves really\". Ms Zuboff, while highlighting the phenomenon, falls into its trap. Shining a light on the way data can mess with people's heads is fine. But defining surveillance capitalism as a Big Brother autocracy that threatens human freedom? However dystopian, that has the whiff of inevitablism all over it.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-QR7O8EF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6X-RYG1-JBKN-B200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Search, media, mobile, even virtual reality and cars - at times it feels like there is nothing that the monolithic Silicon Valley titan cannot turn its hand too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What about finance though? That has always seemed to be a hurdle too far for Google, but surely the firm that has redefined how we organise and gather information could become a bank and redefine how we organise and gather our money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/verticals/finance/peter-thiel-leads-the-march-on-foreign-investment-in-uk-and-european-fintech-4773913\">fintech startups</url>, including a variety of digital challenger banks, has certainly shown that the financial industry is ripe for disruption by technology, and Google, with all its infrastructure and data processing power, appears to be one of the firms that would be perfectly positioned to do it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Furthermore, the firm has already dipped its toe into the waters of financial services with the Google Wallet payments service. On the back of this, in January 2015, it also began allowing users in the UK to send or request money from within its highly popular Gmail email service. Previously only US customers had been able to do this.</p><p>Amazon has, of course, already taken the lead as a tech firm jumping into offering financial products. In July 2015 it began <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/verticals/small-business/amazon-battles-banks-with-seller-lending-scheme-4611627\">offering loans</url> to thousands of invited sellers in its market place, indicating that the big tech firms are starting to be not just interested, but active in the finance space.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/apps/mobile/wallet/\">Samsung</url> and Apple too offer payment and wallet services, tied to their mobile devices.</p><p>Forrester analyst Oliwia Berdak is clear that she does not think that Google will become a bank, and in July 2014 she wrote a research paper called \"Why Google Bank Won't Happen\". She said it was more likely the company would create \"a Google powered financial services hub.</p><p>Now in 2016, Berdak still stands by her prediction. \"Not much has happened in terms of progress in some of the areas I listed there, like payments, comparison of financial products\" she told CBR.</p><p>\"Google is still trying to build out its digital wallet. There hasn't been much progress. More progress has been made by Apple, or Samsung, rather than Google,\" she said.</p><p>She also said that in the US Google now offer mortgage comparison and insurance comparison services \"but when it comes to the other elements, like management or digital financial advice they've always thought, and still think this is sort of farfetched, and is more linked to Google's hopes for Google Now as a virtual personal assistant that knows it all.\"</p><p>In a follow up article in 2014 titled <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/oliwia_berdak/14-07-29-why_asking_about_google_bank_is_the_wrong_question\">\"Why Asking About Google Bank Is The Wrong Question\"</url>, having being pestered for an answer to the question 'how vulnerable to disruption are some of the legacy players in the financial sector' from banking clients, Berdak said: \"It's the assumptions that are faulty here; assumptions that reveal precisely the type of legacy mindset that makes many retail banks so vulnerable to disruption.\"</p><p>She went onto say that \"Many retail financial firms still haven't grasped the full potential of digital disruption.</p><p>\"They think that new competitors will use their digital might to beat them at their own game, be that through more efficient processes, brilliant algorithms or better user experience. While these three things do matter, what matters most is the purpose which they serve.\"</p><p>Ultimately, she said, \"digital disruptors like Google are disruptive because they don't play by the rules.\"</p><p>Peter Simon, Head of Information at Barclays, echoes Berdak's scepticism at the idea that Google may became a full service bank.</p><p>\"Will somebody like a Google want to be a bank bank?\" he says. \"I think there's lots of challenges with being a bank,\" which he believes will put them off making the leap.</p><p>Simon says that many aspects of being a bank would probably not suit Google. \"There's a lot of things we do as a bank, we carry cash, we process cheques, we're financially inclusive - if you walk in off the street and if you need an account we'll give you an account.\"</p><p>He does, however, accept that the financial sector remains a tempting one for firms to get into.</p><p>\"Look at something like Orange getting into banking, or Amazon starting to do lending - small instalment credit to both its business base and its retail customers, the financial sector is a large sector, and people will look at it, any competitor would look at it,\" he said.</p><p>Ultimately, Simon follows Berdak's line of thinking, believing that it is more likely that Google will begin offering niche financial products that it can make money from, essentially extending its current offer, as opposed to become a full service bank.</p><p>\"It is more likely, like you see with Amazon, about being able to offer instalment credit, because you can make a 20-30 per cent return on that with the data you have, without necessarily having to open a branch,\" he said.</p><p>Others in the banking sector appear to be more concerned by the prospect of a Google challenge than Simons is, indicating there maybe be something afoot.</p><p>In March 2015 the Economist Intelligence Unit, when conducting a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.economistinsights.com/financial-services/analysis/future-factors-2015/fullreport\">survey of the retail banking sector</url>, found that \"New competitors are adding to the pressure, egged on by regulators keen to break powerful cabals. Over one-third (36 per cent) of respondents expect technology and e-commerce companies to be their biggest competitors by 2020. Payment players such as Paypal or new banks may already be old hat (12 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively).</p><p>25 per cent of respondents felt that technology could most effectively help banks know their customers better, and knowing people is what Google thrives on.</p><p>Berdak did point out though that Google's knowledge about purchases comes from the quite limited data pool of receipts received through Gmail. \"The bit that it's missing , of course is the spending,\" she said. \"How people spend their money, what products they buy. The only visibility Google has into that is the receipts that someone gets in their inbox. \"</p><p>It is noticeable though that neither Berdak, Simon, or indeed the banking sector, completely dismisses the idea of Google offering more financial products. \"If I was a competitor I'd say why do I want to do the whole banking thing,\" is as far as Simon will go, while Berdak speaks about a \"Google powered financial services hub.\"</p><p>The temptation for Google to get into the banking sector only increases when you take a closer look at the numbers. The University of Cambridge Judge Business School noted the ongoing growth of non-cash payments, despite the financial crisis, and the development of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology used by Google and others.</p><p>Ultimately, it comes down to a question of what is meant by a bank in 2016. Challengers like Atom are getting licenses and funding and are solely based on mobile apps. Another, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/verticals/finance/starling-bank-raises-fund-for-its-digital-service-in-uk-4774821\">Starling</url>, only offers current accounts. The real question then, perhaps, is why would Google not become a bank?<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PDMNEW-4785109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PDMNEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HWH-M561-JCF9-253R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Progressive Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Progressive Media - Company News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33806\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That raises an interesting question: Do conservatives suddenly look more appealing to Big Tech in the face of regulatory statements by Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).In an op-ed penned for Fox Business[1] published on October 3, Google CEO Sundar Pichai argued that Google could help small businesses to flourish. </p><p>As at least three antitrust investigations of Google take place, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren are calling to break up these big tech companies. Google's op-ed on Fox Business seems like a bid for the right's trust as the left begins to disown Silicon Valley's biggest companies.Pichai made the argument that small businesses need big businesses. He wrote, 'At Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology, whether it's finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently.'Business Insider insinuated[2] that this op-ed was a move to the right, with the headline, 'Google's CEO is making his case to conservatives in a bid to ward off regulation.'Big Tech is facing an uphill battle against Big Government. The Department of Justice, 50 U.S. attorneys general, and the Federal Trade Commission have all launched investigations[3] of Google's potential antitrust violations. Notable politicians such as Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) have criticized the big tech company in Senate hearings for its problems with privacy.In a March 14 Senate hearing, Hawley[4] told Google's senior privacy counsel Will DeVries, 'the idea that your company and others like it are sweeping up information to build a user profile on them that will track every step every move and monetizing that, and they cant do anything about it \u2014 that's a big problem.'But in the op-ed, Pichai said that having that information was a good that could be used by small businesses. He wrote, 'At its core, connecting local businesses with customers is an information problem.'The solution for small businesses, then, would be to access the information on Google.

That raises an interesting question: Do conservatives suddenly look more appealing to Big Tech in the face of regulatory statements by Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).In an op-ed penned for Fox Business[1] published on October 3, Google CEO Sundar Pichai argued that Google could help small businesses to flourish. </p><p>As at least three antitrust investigations of Google take place, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren are calling to break up these big tech companies. Google's op-ed on Fox Business seems like a bid for the right's trust as the left begins to disown Silicon Valley's biggest companies.Pichai made the argument that small businesses need big businesses. He wrote, 'At Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology, whether it's finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently.'Business Insider insinuated[2] that this op-ed was a move to the right, with the headline, 'Google's CEO is making his case to conservatives in a bid to ward off regulation.'Big Tech is facing an uphill battle against Big Government. The Department of Justice, 50 U.S. attorneys general, and the Federal Trade Commission have all launched investigations[3] of Google's potential antitrust violations. Notable politicians such as Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) have criticized the big tech company in Senate hearings for its problems with privacy.In a March 14 Senate hearing, Hawley[4] told Google's senior privacy counsel Will DeVries, 'the idea that your company and others like it are sweeping up information to build a user profile on them that will track every step every move and monetizing that, and they cant do anything about it   that's a big problem.'But in the op-ed, Pichai said that having that information was a good that could be used by small businesses. He wrote, 'At its core, connecting local businesses with customers is an information problem.'The solution for small businesses, then, would be to access the information on Google. 'This access to information is part of what helps Google drive over one billion connections for businesses nationwide,' Pichai continued.According to Business Insider, even though the op-ed states that Google has many tools for small businesses to use, 'the goal is a self-serving one.' There is some benefit to small businesses knowing how to use Google for their own purposes, because this puts money in Google's pocket.

That raises an interesting question: Do conservatives suddenly look more appealing to Big Tech in the face of regulatory statements by Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). In an op-ed penned for Fox Business[1] published on October 3, Google CEO Sundar Pichai (pictured) argued that Google could help small businesses to flourish. </p><p>As at least three antitrust investigations of Google take place, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren are calling to break up these big tech companies. Google's op-ed on Fox Business seems like a bid for the right's trust as the left begins to disown Silicon Valley's biggest companies. Pichai made the argument that small businesses need big businesses. He wrote, 'At Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology, whether it's finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently.' Business Insider insinuated[2] that this op-ed was a move to the right, with the headline, 'Google's CEO is making his case to conservatives in a bid to ward off regulation.' Big Tech is facing an uphill battle against Big Government. The Department of Justice, 50 U.S. attorneys general, and the Federal Trade Commission have all launched investigations[3] of Google's potential antitrust violations. Notable politicians such as Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) have criticized the big tech company in Senate hearings for its problems with privacy. In a March 14 Senate hearing, Hawley[4] told Google's senior privacy counsel Will DeVries, 'the idea that your company and others like it are sweeping up information to build a user profile on them that will track every step every move and monetizing that, and they cant do anything about it \u2014 that's a big problem.' But in the op-ed, Pichai said that having that information was a good that could be used by small businesses. He wrote, 'At its core, connecting local businesses with customers is an information problem.' The solution for small businesses, then, would be to access the information on Google. 'This access to information is part of what helps Google drive over one billion connections for businesses nationwide,' Pichai continued. According to Business Insider, even though the op-ed states that Google has many tools for small businesses to use, 'the goal is a self-serving one.' There is some benefit to small businesses knowing how to use Google for their own purposes, because this puts money in Google's pocket.

The challenges they predict are imaginary \u2014 for now \u2014 but their arguments illuminate the urgent questions of today and prepare us for tomorrow. The opinion piece below is a work of fiction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I shouldn\u2019t have to publish this in The New York Times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ten years ago, I could have published this on my personal website, or shared it on one of the big social media platforms. But that was before the United States government decided to regulate both the social media platforms and blogging sites as if they were newspapers, making them legally responsible for the content they published. </p><p>The move was spurred on by an unholy and unlikely coalition of media companies crying copyright; national security experts wringing their hands about terrorism; and people who were dismayed that our digital public squares had become infested by fascists, harassers and cybercriminals. Bit by bit, the legal immunity of the platforms was eroded \u2014 from the judges who put Facebook on the line for the platform\u2019s inaction during the Provo Uprising to the lawmakers who amended section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a bid to get Twitter to clean up its Nazi problem. </p><p>[Cory Doctorow answered your questions about his \u201cOp-Ed from the Future\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1143593916677013507\">on Twitter</url>.]</p><p>While the media in the United States remained protected by the First Amendment, members of the press in other countries were not so lucky. The rest of the world responded to the crisis by tightening rules on acceptable speech. But even the most prolific news service \u2014 a giant wire service like AP-AFP or Thomson-Reuters-TransCanada-Huawei \u2014 only publishes several thousand articles per day. And thanks to their armies of lawyers, editors and insurance underwriters, they are able to make the news available without falling afoul of new rules prohibiting certain kinds of speech \u2014 including everything from Saudi blasphemy rules to Austria\u2019s ban on calling politicians \u201cfascists\u201d to Thailand\u2019s stringent l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 rules. They can ensure that news in Singapore is not \u201cout of bounds\u201d and that op-eds in Britain don\u2019t call for the abolition of the monarchy.</p><p>But not the platforms \u2014 they couldn\u2019t hope to make a dent in their users\u2019 personal expressions. From YouTube\u2019s 2,000 hours of video uploaded every minute to Facebook-Weibo\u2019s three billion daily updates, there was no scalable way to carefully examine the contributions of every user and assess whether they violated any of these new laws. So the platforms fixed this the Silicon Valley way: They automated it. Badly.</p><p>Which is why I have to publish this in The New York Times. </p><p>The platforms and personal websites are fine if you want to talk about sports, relate your kids\u2019 latest escapades or shop. But if you want to write something about how the platforms and government legislation can\u2019t tell the difference between sex trafficking and sex, nudity and pornography, terrorism investigations and terrorism itself or copyright infringement and parody, you\u2019re out of luck. Any one of those keywords will give the filters an incurable case of machine anxiety \u2014 but all of them together? Forget it. </p><p>If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, all that stuff belongs in the newspaper,\u201d then you\u2019ve fallen into a trap: Democracies aren\u2019t strengthened when a professional class gets to tell us what our opinions are allowed to be. </p><p>And the worst part is, the new regulations haven\u2019t ended harassment, extremism or disinformation. Hardly a day goes by without some post full of outright Naziism, flat-eartherism and climate trutherism going viral. There are whole armies of Nazis and conspiracy theorists who do nothing but test the filters, day and night, using custom software to find the adversarial examples that slip past the filters\u2019 machine-learning classifiers. </p><p>It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Once upon a time, the internet teemed with experimental, personal publications. The mergers and acquisitions and anticompetitive bullying that gave rise to the platforms and killed personal publishing made Big Tech both reviled and powerful, and they were targeted for breakups by ambitious lawmakers. Had we gone that route, we might have an internet that was robust, resilient, variegated and dynamic.</p><p>Think back to the days when companies like Apple and Google \u2014 back when they were stand-alone companies \u2014 bought hundreds of start-ups every year. What if we\u2019d put a halt to the practice, re-establishing the traditional antitrust rules against \u201cmergers to monopoly\u201d and acquiring your nascent competitors? What if we\u2019d established an absolute legal defense for new market entrants seeking to compete with established monopolists? </p><p>Most of these new companies would have failed \u2014 if only because most new ventures fail \u2014 but the survivors would have challenged the Big Tech giants, eroding their profits and giving them less lobbying capital. They would have competed to give the best possible deals to the industries that tech was devouring, like entertainment and news. And they would have competed with the news and entertainment monopolies to offer better deals to the pixel-stained wretches who produced the \u201ccontent\u201d that was the source of all their profits.</p><p>But instead, we decided to vest the platforms with statelike duties to punish them for their domination. In doing so, we cemented that domination. Only the largest companies can afford the kinds of filters we\u2019ve demanded of them, and that means that any would-be trustbuster who wants to break up the companies and bring them to heel first must unwind the mesh of obligations we\u2019ve ensnared the platforms in and build new, state-based mechanisms to perform those duties. </p><p>Our first mistake was giving the platforms the right to decide who could speak and what they could say. Our second mistake was giving them the duty to make that call, a billion times a day.</p><p>Still, I am hopeful, if not optimistic. Google did not exist 30 years ago; perhaps in 30 years\u2019 time, it will be a distant memory. It seems unlikely, but then again, so did the plan to rescue Miami and the possibility of an independent Tibet \u2014 two subjects that are effectively impossible to discuss on the platforms. In a world where so much else is up for grabs, finally, perhaps, we can once again reach for a wild, woolly, independent and free internet.</p><p>It\u2019s still within our reach: an internet that doesn\u2019t force us to choose between following the algorithmically enforced rules or disappearing from the public discourse; an internet where we can host our own discussions and debate the issues of the day without worrying that our words will disappear. In the meantime, here I am, forced to publish in The New York Times. If only that were a \u201cscalable solution,\u201d you could do so as well.</p><p>Cory Doctorow (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow\">@doctorow</url>) is a science fiction writer whose latest book is \u201cRadicalized,\u201d a special consultant to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and an M.I.T.

Based in the city's bustling start-up hub Catalyst Inc, the tech firm's chief executive is a man with a billion-dollar goal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have a vision that we will make this the first, or one of the first, unicorns to come from Northern Ireland,\" said Co Down man Alan Foreman (46).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such a claim might earn a swift rebuke in any of Belfast's many drinking establishments, but in Las Vegas, where Alan has just returned after launching the firm's latest product at the world's biggest tech event, CES, the industry is sitting up and taking notice. B-Secur uses the human heart as the source of its next-level biometric technology.</p><p>From early incursions into electrocardiogram (ECG) based security, the company is now adopting its software for use in the motor and wearable tech industries.</p><p>\"Through our technology, I can tell you how stressed you are in real time, I can tell you what your heart rate is like, I can tell how fatigued you are and I can tell if you have any health problems,\" Alan said.</p><p>Introduced into a vehicle or an item of clothing and the applications are immeasurable. \"By simply touching your steering wheel, or through the watch or T-shirt you are wearing, we can see in real time and detect how well you are.</p><p>\"That has huge implications for the NHS, and for drivers. A quarter of all driver road deaths are caused by fatigue. We know about three minutes before a driver is in a fatigued-enough state where they cannot drive the car. So we can save lives.\"</p><p>Founded in 2002 by Colin Anderson, B-Secur emerged out of efforts to understand the differences between people for security purposes.</p><p>The company remained largely dormant for a number of years, until it gained new momentum just over four years ago when Alan Foreman came on board.</p><p>The Co Down man, who had been out of Northern Ireland for some 25 years, was at the time the global managing director for tech firm Accenture.</p><p>\"Colin said, 'Why don't you look at this little dormant project in if and pick it up? The world is now right for the next generation of biometrics.' \" The adoption of biometrics into smartphone devices has resulted in an explosion of the technology, with millions of people using fingerprint, iris, voice and facial recognition daily.</p><p>\"Until Apple put it into the iPhone four years ago, no one was comfortable about sharing that type of biometric data,\" Alan recalled.</p><p>\"Now everyone accesses their bank account or personal details using biometrics. So the world has really moved on in recent years.</p><p>\"But those traditional methods of biometrics are really quite rudimentary and now the tech world is looking for the next evolution.\"</p><p>B-Secur believes it has the answer in the guise of its ECG/ heart technology.</p><p>\"The new generation of biometrics, such as ECG, offers much more,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"Not only can we secure data, but we can offer insights into individuals' health and wellness.</p><p>Speaking last week, the chief executive was still buzzing after the successful launch of B-Secur's new product Heartkey at CES - the world's largest tech event in Las Vegas.</p><p>\"We were chosen as a 'top pick' for CES; I don't think that's ever happened for a Northern Ireland company before. It's really cool.\"</p><p>B-Secur has already developed prototype T-shirts and steering wheels to demonstrate the technology's potential.</p><p>It's already understood to have attracted the interest of a number of major car manufacturers, with one of Europe's biggest motor firms believed to be among those currently testing the tech.</p><p>\"Our software fits into everyone else's technology, whether it be a steering wheel or a wearable,\" said Alan.</p><p>While the potential adoption by major German car makers is an exciting turn for the firm, Alan believes its application could have an even greater impact in the heavily regulated world of truck driving, where drivers face restrictions on their time behind the wheel.</p><p>\"If we can automate that and know the driver is within certain parameters, then we can control the vehicle.\"</p><p>Despite the market for wearable tracker devices becoming increasingly crowded, Alan remains undaunted.</p><p>\"The stuff that Fitbit and Apple and what everybody has come out with is very rudimentary technology.</p><p>\"They use a little light that shines into your skin, it's old technology. So all of them are coming to us now to give them ECG or medical-grade technology.</p><p>\"We can build that into a Fitbit, for example, and allow it to move from just a fitness tracker toward a health or medical device. That's where the world wants to go.</p><p>\"Apple and Google have already announced that they [each] want to move to become a medical and health-related company. That's where the big market is for the tech guys in the world.\"</p><p>Apple are currently developing their own in-house ECG programme.</p><p>But Alan said other firms who have attempted to deploy similar software to date have eventually turned to B Secur and Belfast.</p><p>\"We're working with every other player in the market.\" B Secur has also developed a new T-shirt which similarly will detect stress and fatigue.</p><p>\"You can put this onto older dementia patients or young children, take them out of the hospital environment and monitor them in real time.\"</p><p>Other potential uses include monitoring security or armed forces; fire fighters; medical staff or any employees where health and safety is an issue.</p><p>\"We know if their stress level is beyond the norm such that intervention is required.</p><p>\"All the big tech companies are starting to wake up to the idea that this is possibly important.\"</p><p>After four years of development, things are beginning to move fast at B-Secur.</p><p>In July 2017, the company sealed the largest funding round of any Northern Ireland start-up that year, when it raised \u00a33.5m from a syndicate of investors including Accelerated Digital Ventures (ADV) and Kernel Capital.</p><p>Last month, B-Secur gathered another significant investment, understood to be in excess of 2017's record-breaking round.</p><p>\"It allows us to really accelerate into delivering to our customers in many geographies and allows us to grow,\" Alan explained.</p><p>In the past 12 months, B-Secur has grown from five to 36 staff. It expects to add another 10 and a new office in San Francisco this year.</p><p>Next month, it will move into a larger space at its base in Catalyst Inc.</p><p>Although he still lives in south Manchester with his Glaswegian wife Roisin and their three children Tom (11) and twins Charlie and Rose (8), Alan admits he is considering a more permanent move to home ground.</p><p>From north Down originally, he grew up \"a country boy\", attending Andrew's Memorial Primary School in Comber before moving on to Regent House Grammar in Newtownards and later Campbell College in Belfast.</p><p>Aged 18 he left Northern Ireland to study business and engineering at the University of Strathclyde. In 1995, he began an 18-year career with technology and business consulting firm Accenture.</p><p>Rising to managing director, he specialised in product and healthcare-based industries.</p><p>He remained there until June 2014, when he came on board with B-Secur.</p><p>While he travels less now than in his Accenture days, airport departure lounges remain a big feature in his life.</p><p>\"I fly over to Belfast every week. Most of our investors and clients are not in Northern Ireland, so I spend my time running the business in Belfast and the other half with our customers.</p><p>\"When I was in Accenture, I was away five nights a week. Life is relatively easy now - it's all UKbased, for a start. Manchester to Belfast is a very straight-forward flight. I try to keep it to two nights a week away now.\"</p><p>He insisted that the use of Belfast as B-Secur's base is not about sentiment.</p><p>\"I searched the whole of Europe whenever we were setting it up. I considered Berlin, but eventually we landed on Belfast, mainly because of the talent we able to see,\" he said.</p><p>\"Back four years there was also a growing ecosystem, which I would put down to Catalyst Inc.</p><p>\"Small companies can thrive and become unicorns if they've got enough momentum in a small space.</p><p>\"Catalyst has joined us up with people in England and Scotland. That's what has given us the ability to grow.\"</p><p>The proximity to Queen's University's two key tech hubs in the Titanic Quarter - the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) and the Institute of Electronics, Communications and IT (CSIT) - was another draw.</p><p>B-Secur has also successfully encouraged some of its recruits to move from England to Northern Ireland, including its chief commercial officer, Ben Carter. Along with chief technology officer Adrian Condon, the pair have been key to the start-up's success to date.</p><p>\"Those guys have really built the technology so well and run the show down at Catalyst,\" Alan added.</p><p>\"We still articulate ourselves as still early stage, but our technology is pretty pioneering stuff. \"We've developed from a very small base to a company that's making waves on the world forum.</p><p>\"We're starting to investigate China, we can't avoid it. But we need to nail the US first as our primary market before we spread our wings even further.</p><p>\"We're really only starting to be understood.\"</p><p>in ? Until Apple put it in the iPhone four years ago, no one was comfortable with sharing biometric data</p><p>It expects to add another 10 and ?

The results show that India lags behind many developing and developed countries in this area. In order to boost India's trade competitiveness in the digital era, a Digitally-Informed Foreign Trade Policy is advocated that would aim to improve India's digital infrastructure for trade, enhance the digital content in its exports, build digital skills in tradeable sectors, promote the use of digital technologies in manufacturing exports, and use big data analytics to inform foreign trade policy.</p><p><br/><br/>An earlier version of the paper \"Is India Digitally Prepared for International Trade?\" was uploaded as a discussion paper of Research and Information System for Developing Countries in December 2018.<br/><br/>With the onset of the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, many developing countries, including India, are facing new opportunities and challenges in international trade. Increasing digitalisation can greatly impact the trade competitiveness of the countries, benefiting those who are able to increase the digital content of their production and exports while adversely impacting countries that are unable to catch up in the digital race. To digitally prepare itself, India has initiated some concrete programmes like Digital India, which aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge economy. As stated on its official website, it aims to provide citizens \"with Digital Infrastructure as a Utility; Governance and Services on Demand; and Digital Empowerment.\" The government has initiated many sub-programmes under Digital India, including the Aadhaar identity platform, an agri-market app, e-panchayat, and MyGov. The government has also initiated a working group to design a national policy for e-commerce. In this context, the main objective of this article is to examine India's digital preparedness in the context of international trade by comparing the country's digital infrastructure to other developing and developed countries, along with various indicators of digital development. It will also attempt to estimate the extent of digital content in India's exports in different sectors-including its traditional export sectors-as compared to other countries. It also aims to offer a way forward through suggestions that aim to help increase India's trade competitiveness in the digital era.<br/><br/>Digitalisation can impact the global trade competitiveness of a country since it affects all the stages of a value chain, including pre-production, production, and post-production. It could lead to a large-scale reorganisation of existing global value chains (GVCs) and result in the emergence of new GVCs. Firms are using big data analytics to analyse consumer preferences, forecast demand, and customise products. Super platforms like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Alibaba are providing two-sided and in some cases many-sided markets where producers and consumers can interact, enabling the platforms to collect more data and strengthen their capacity to reorganise international markets (Gurkaynak et al 2017; Rysman 2009). The network effect increases the gains of these platforms and enhances their global competitiveness, thereby allowing them to lock in their attractiveness, destroy competition, and emerge as powerful monopolies (Belleflamme and Peitz 2016).<br/><br/>Even though reining in the fast-growing super platforms and big tech firms is a challenge for developing countries, these platforms are also opening access to new markets and exposing domestic consumers to new products and producers through e-commerce. Further, digital technologies like robotics and 3D printing are increasingly being used in the production stage. This is creating opportunities for developing countries to upgrade their position in GVCs, as a higher amount of digital content can add value to their exports. However, it also heightens risk. If countries are unable to digitise their manufacturing, they face the prospect of losing global trade competitiveness, even in their traditional export sectors and within domestic markets.<br/><br/>While there is a vast quantity of literature on the various factors affecting trade, digitalisation is a relatively new factor and very few studies have empirically estimated its impact on trade, especially in India. The debate around the possible impact of digitalisation on international trade began in 1998 when the World Trade Organization (WTO) member nations decided on a moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. The growing digitalisation of exportable products like software, music, e-books, and video games-which were earlier exported as physical products but are increasingly being delivered electronically-has prompted research on the implications of the moratorium. Surveys estimated that Zimbabwe experienced a significant tariff revenue loss by not imposing duties on digital products (Makoni et al 2013). Banga (2017) estimated the impact of a permanent zero duty regime on 38 products that are being increasingly digitalised and exported electronically. The study found that a permanent moratorium would lead to an increase in the import of digital products by developing countries and additional tariff revenue losses for many countries. India was found to be a net importer of these identified digitalised products in 2015.<br/><br/>It must be noted that digitalisation has proceeded very rapidly over the past few years and its impact on international trade goes beyond custom duties on electronic transmissions. In this scenario, like many other developing countries, India is also grappling to digitalise as fast as possible in order to retain its trade competitiveness. To assess whether India will be able to retain its competitiveness in the digital world, this article compares the country's existing digital infrastructure and its use of digital technologies with other developing and developed countries. Further, the article estimates the value added by digital services to the total exports and sector-specific exports of 43 countries.1 Digital services includes computer programming, consultancy and related activities, information services, and telecommunications. The analysis is based on national input-output tables derived from the world input-output tables taken from the World Input-Output Database and is undertaken at aggregate and sectoral levels using Leontief decomposition (in the R package). The article further suggests ways for India to increase its trade competitiveness in the digital era by designing a digitally informed foreign trade policy, which can help in increasing the digital content in India's exports and improve its global competitiveness.<br/><br/>The article first discusses the interrelated components of digital infrastructure and compares India's existing digital infrastructure with those of other developing and developed countries using various indicators. The subsequent section outlines the methodology of the article and presents the results of empirical estimates of the value added by digital services to India's total exports and compares it with other countries. The comparison is made over time for total exports as well as for exports at the sectoral level. This is followed by a discussion on the need for a digitally informed foreign trade policy in India and the importance of preserving policy space in trade and investment agreements, especially in the WTO.<br/><br/>Digital Infrastructure: India and the World<br/><br/>Digital infrastructure goes much beyond information and communications technology (ICT) and e-commerce. It can comprise three kinds of interrelated infrastructures: ICT infrastructure, cloud computing infrastructure, and data infrastructure, all of which are accompanied by the use of related digital skills and technologies. Figure 1 depicts the different layers of digital infrastructure.</p><p><br/><br/>Creating ICT infrastructure, which constitutes universally accessible and affordable internet access and connectivity, is the first step towards building digital infrastructure. This is complemented by ICT education and skills. The second step towards building digital infrastructure is to develop and use cloud computing infrastructure. Cloud computing involves soft infrastructure that can remotely provide computing services as a general utility to all internet users. These services can be further divided into three main categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). IaaS is a self-service model for managing remote data centre infrastructures, including networking services like firewalls or server spaces. SaaS eliminates the need to install applications on individual computers through web-based services such as Google Apps, Facebook, and Twitter. The PaaS model reduces the amount of coding required for developers to customise software. Users can create apps through software components that are made available by PaaS. By providing remote infrastructure, cloud computing has the potential to greatly reduce the need for hard infrastructure like storage disks and drastically reduce the cost of computing and using software in a country.<br/><br/>The most important component of digital infrastructure is data infrastructure, which has the ability to give rise to global monopolies and change the relative positions of countries in terms of their shares in global production, consumption, investments, and international trade. Data infrastructure consists of two parts: data and data intelligence. Many have termed data the \"new oil\" since it powers the digital economy in the same way as oil powers the industrial economy.2 Data is generated not just by the people who use the internet, but by almost every person who uses smart technologies like televisions, cars, phones, and fridges, since the Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to connect devices through sensors and collect data. Non-personal data is also generated by purchasing goods, seeking admission to schools, getting admitted in hospitals, using toll roads, and so on. Data intelligence combines several layers of data to form big data, which is then transformed into information through analysis. This information leads to knowledge that is converted into value. The value generated from big data is unique and forms the basis of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which helps create unique products and services that are more efficient and less costly to produce and consume.<br/><br/>Ownership of data and the capability of intelligently transforming data into highly-efficient products and services has led to the growth of big tech firms-also known as \"superstar firms\"-with monopolistic powers (Autor et al 2017). Economies of scale and network effects make it difficult for new firms to compete with these large monopolies. Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Airbnb, and Uber are examples of such monopolies created by the digital economy. Data intelligence manifests itself in designing digital technologies like AI, robots, 3D printing, and e-commerce.<br/><br/>Comparing India's digital infrastructure with those of other developing and developed countries can provide an assessment of the relative position of India in the digital world.<br/><br/>ICT Infrastructure and Digital Skills<br/><br/>India has progressed fast in terms of building its ICT infrastructure. Internet users increased from 1.4 million in 1998 to 462 million in 2016, that is, from 0.1% of India's population to 36.5% of its population.3 Despite this rapid increase in the number of internet users and other initiatives of the Indian government, India lags behind many developing countries not only in terms of its ICT development index ranking-which is based on internet access, connectivity, and affordability-but also in most ICT development indicators. In fact, India is behind much smaller countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka in many ICT development indicators.<br/><br/>Table 1 compares India to other countries in terms of some of the major ICT development indicators. India's ICT development index gives it a rank of 134 out of 176 countries. Apart from developed countries, most of Asia's developing nations such as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka rank higher than India. India ranks lower than most of these countries in terms of fixed broadband subscription per 100 inhabitants, active mobile broadband subscription per 100 inhabitants, 3G coverage, percentage of households with internet access, and in terms of international internet bandwidth per internet user. Compared to China, India ranks lower in almost all indicators of ICT development. In fact, India does not meet the Asia-Pacific average for most ICT development indicators. Even within the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) grouping, India has the lowest ICT development index ranking and lags behind in other ICT development indicators. Compared to the world average, India lags behind in terms of all ICT development indicators.</p><p><br/><br/>In terms of digital skills, India appears to be in a much stronger position. In 2014, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), there were 21.03 million software developers in the world at the start of 2017. According to Evans Data Corporation, the United States (US) has 3.6 million developers compared to India's 2.75 million, which it estimates will rise to 5.2 million by the end of 2018, overtaking the US, which will have an estimated 4.5 million developers by then (Thibodeau 2013). Although India may surpass the US in terms of number of developers, according to HackerRank, in terms of quality of developers, China ranks number one while India ranks 31st in a list of 50 countries (Trikha 2016). The value of the global software products market stood at $413 billion in 2017, with an annual growth rate of 10.4%, while India's share was only 2% (Nasscom 2017; New Indian Express 2017).<br/><br/>Cloud Infrastructure<br/><br/>India is proactively promoting cloud infrastructure in the country. Digital India includes initiatives like DigiLocker, which is a cloud-based storage system for official documents. Further, e-governance, which provides real time information, and e-banking, which enables mobile banking services, are both initiatives that involve huge amounts of data and therefore, need cloud infrastructure. The public cloud market in India was worth $1.9 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $4.2 billion by 2020 (Gartner 2017). Several major global cloud providers, including Alibaba, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have opened data centres in the country.<br/><br/>However, in spite of this fast growth in cloud computing, India's performance compares unfavourably with its global competitors. In metrics that are crucial to developing competitive cloud computing services such as internet bandwidth per Internet user-which measures total used capacity of international internet bandwidth in megabytes per second divided by total number of internet users-India ranks very low (116th out of 143 countries) (Table 2). Many South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka rank higher than India while South East Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Cambodia also rank higher than India. Within the BRICS countries, India ranks second-lowest after Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. India cannot be compared with developed countries like the US, UK, and Germany in this regard as they all rank within the top 50.</p><p><br/><br/>When it comes to the affordability of fixed broadband internet tariffs (monthly subscription charges for wired broadband internet in terms of purchasing power parity, measured in US dollars), India ranks quite high compared to other developing countries (36th out of 140) because of its well-regulated prices, although the difference in prices is not large. Other South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan all rank higher than India. However, many South East Asian countries have higher prices than India.<br/><br/>Internet speed is just as important as the price of internet use. According to Akamai, India ranks 89th out of 149 countries in terms of connection speeds, with an average speed of 6.5 megabytes per second (Table 2). India is also behind 100 countries, including most of South East Asia, in terms of secure internet services per million people.<br/><br/>Although India ranks low in the aforementioned indicators with respect to cloud infrastructure, the country has been projected as one of the top global destinations for cloud services. According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), the Indian saaS market, which was worth $407 million in 2016, is expected to triple in value by 2020. India's tech start-up ecosystem has been hailed as rising and shining, and competing with China for the third position globally, after the US and the UK (NASSCOM 2017). These trends are encouraging for India. However, other countries are developing their tech start-up ecosystems much faster, and according to the 2017 Global Start-up Ecosystem Report, which looks at 55 start-up ecosystems across 28 countries and ranks the top 20, Bengaluru (India) ranked 20th, dropping five places in a year.<br/><br/>Data Infrastructure<br/><br/>Some of the important components of data infrastructure include big data analytics, AI, robotics, 3D printing, and e-commerce. Comparing the progress made by India with other countries in these areas is difficult due to scant statistics. However, the available statistics do show that even in this area, India needs to catch up with other developing and developed countries.<br/><br/>Big data and artificial intelligence: In terms of big data analytics and AI, China has made rapid progress and is now catching up with the US. The global big data market grew from $7.6 billion in 2011 to $22.5 billion in 2015. In 2017, it grew to $35 billion and is expected to reach $56 billion in 2020 (Statista 2018). The big data market in China grew by 45% in 2016 to reach $2.5 billion. According to NASSCOM, India also has a growing big data analytics sector valued at around $2 billion. NASSCOM predicts that India's big data market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% and will amount to 32% of global market in 2022. However, according to the Worldwide Semi-Annual Big Data and Analytics Spending Guide, published by IDC, the Asia Pacific big data market will reach $14.7 billion in 2018. China, at $5.5 billion, will have the biggest market, followed by Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand (Analytics Insight 2018).<br/><br/>While AI is still in its nascent stages in India, China has made it a national priority and is rapidly developing its AI industry. India's budget allocation for the Digital India programme stands at $477 million, while China is developing a technology park in Beijing worth $2.1 billion, which is greater than the total spending of the US on AI programmes in 2016 of about $1.2 billion (Xinhua 2018). China intends for its AI industry to generate $60 billion annual output by 2025 and become a $150 billion industry by 2030.<br/><br/>In 2017, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence indicated a 13% growth in research output from China in the period 2012-17, as compared to a 6% decline in the US. Although comparative figures are not available for India, a study shows that India as a whole produces fewer machine learning papers than a single university in China (Aggarwal et al 2015). According to the Global AI Talent Report of 2018, India's pool of 386 AI researchers is the 10th largest. Among major economies, it has the lowest number of PhD-level AI researchers, trailing the US (9,010), the UK (1,861), Canada (1,154), France (797), Australia (657), Germany (626), Spain (606), Switzerland (441), and China (413).<br/><br/>Countries are rapidly increasing their investments in AI and India is also gearing up with a nationwide AI programme and focused funding for research and development (R&amp;D) of AI. Under the nationwide AI programme, it is expected that new schemes, incentives, and industrial policies will be launched for start-ups and venture funds, but these will take time to fructify. With investments in AI increasing, there is also a growing demand for people with digital skills. While there is a large pool of information technology (IT) workers in India according to NASSCOM, almost 50% of the IT workforce will need to learn new technologies.<br/><br/>Robotics: One of the fastest-growing digital technologies is robotics. Since 2010, the demand for industrial robots has accelerated due to the increased use of automation and AI. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global robot sales grew at a CAGR of 12% between 2010 and 2016. India has also experienced a rise in its use of robots (Table 3). The number of delivered industrial robots increased by more than 200% in 2016 (2,627) as compared to 2010 (776). However, compared to developed countries and China, India seems to lag far behind. In 2016, five countries-China, South Korea, Japan, the US, and Germany-accounted for 74% of the total sales of robots. In 2016, China surpassed the US and Germany with 87,000 industrial robots. India's performance has been favourable compared to other developing countries and BRICS countries. In 2016, its operational stock surpassed those of most developing countries.</p><p><br/><br/>An important indicator of trade competitiveness of manufactured products in the future will be the use of robots in the manufacturing sector. Table 3 reports the use of robots in manufacturing in 2010 and 2016 for selected developed and developing countries. India's manufacturing sector had an operational stock of 11,237 in 2016, while countries like China, Germany, and the US had more than 1,00,000. Other developing countries, with the exception of Thailand, lagged behind India in the operational stock of robots used in their manufacturing sectors.<br/><br/>While this indicator appears to provide an important competitive edge to Indian manufacturing, it is important to take into consideration the relative size of the manufacturing sector. Thus, robot density-the number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10,000 persons employed in the manufacturing industry-becomes a useful metric. India has one of the lowest robot densities among the selected countries. The global average robot density is 74 robots per 10,000 employees in manufacturing sector. While China is close to the global average and has recorded the fastest growth in robot density (increasing from 25 in 2013 to 68 in 2016), India's robot density remains lower than Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil.<br/><br/>3D printing: Along with automation and robotics, additive manufacturing or 3D printing is progressing fast in the digitalised world. Although 3D printing was invented in the 1980s, it became widespread only after some key patents expired in 2009 and 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the total number of desktop 3D printers sold nearly tripled, with a CAGR of 42% (Adams 2018). The IDC estimates global spending on 3D printing to be around $12 billion in 2018. India has also made progress in 3D printing although it is still at the initial stages of developing this market.<br/><br/>According to A T Kearney's 2017 3D Printing Index-which is based on 38 quantitative metrics in six dimensions using indicators such as a country's current 3D printing footprint, its share in global sales of 3D printers, and 3D printing patent applications-the leaders in this field with an index score between 4.1 and 7.5 are countries like the US, Germany, South Korea, Japan, the UK, Singapore, Canada, Sweden, and France (Smith IV et al 2017). With index scores between 2.7 and 4.0, the challengers are Australia, China, Italy, Malaysia, Taiwan, Spain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Turkey. Countries with index scores between 0.9 and 2.6-including India with a score of 2.5-are seen as followers. In terms of 3D printing, India ranks 25th among 28 countries-below Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brazil and South Africa.<br/><br/>E-commerce: Buying and selling goods and services on the internet is catching on fast. However, there is a need to distinguish between domestic e-commerce and cross-border e-commerce. According to UNCTAD (2018), using various country reports of ACATURE (2015), the e-products and electronically transmitted products market is estimated to be worth approximately $22.5 trillion. Of this, around $21 trillion is estimated to be domestic e-commerce-the buying and selling of e-products within the boundaries of countries. Cross-border e-commerce-international trade wherein e-products cross national boundaries-is estimated to be worth $1.6 trillion. According to NASSCOM, the Indian e-commerce market was worth $14 billion in 2015, up from $10.5 billion in 2014, and having grown at a CAGR of 30% since 2010. Despite this growth, India has a minuscule share-around 1%-of the global cross border e-commerce market, with 69% of it controlled by three countries: China (40%), the US, (20%), and the UK (9%) (UNCTAD 2018). They are followed by Japan (5%), Germany (4%), and France (4%). Thus, six countries control more than 85% of the cross-border e-commerce market.<br/><br/>The rise in cross-border consumer spending in India needs to be an issue of concern rather than celebration. According to a report by PayPal and Ipsos MORI, Indian shoppers spent more than $8.7 billion on cross-border e-commerce in 2016; an increase of 7% since 2015 (Paypers 2017). The report further predicted that Indian shoppers are likely to spend 85% more on global online marketplaces in 2018 (Ahluwalia 2017). The increase of imports into India via e-commerce needs urgent attention.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the rise of large international e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba has made it extremely difficult for national e-commerce platforms to compete, especially given the anti-competitive practices, such as predatory pricing, employed by international players. The recent acquisition of India's Flipkart by Walmart is an example of the consequences of the anti-competitive practices of the global giants, which follow predatory pricing and bear losses in certain countries in order to compete and wipe out local competition. On the back of its Indian unit's battle with Flipkart, Amazon's international losses amounted to over $3 billion (Variyar 2018).<br/><br/>Figure 2 depicts, over time, the profits of a few platforms as a percentage of their revenues. This ratio is as high as 50% for firms like Baidu, while the average profits to revenues ratio for the top 2000 Transnational Corporations for the period 2011-15 is 7%. This makes it possible for these digital platforms to compete with national platforms in identified countries using predatory pricing.</p><p><br/><br/>The profits of these international digital platforms are huge compared to India's e-commerce platforms, which are much smaller in size and mostly make losses or at best, minuscule profits (Abhudeen 2017). In 2015, Amazon's profits were $596 million while Alibaba recorded profits of $3.9 billion.<br/><br/>To compare India's preparedness in e-commerce with other countries, two indicators are used. According to UNCTAD's B2C E-commerce Index, which estimates a country's preparedness for e-commerce and is based on the processes involved in online shopping by consumers directly from sellers, in 2016, India ranked 90th. In the World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index, it ranked 91st out of a list of 140 countries, with countries like China, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Kenya ranking higher than India.<br/><br/>To estimate the impact of digitalisation on trade competitiveness, value added by digital services (computer programming, consultancy and related activities, information service activities, and telecommunications) in total exports and sectoral exports is estimated for 43 countries, including India for the years 2007 and 2014. This indicates the changing trade competitiveness of countries which will depend primarily on the extent of the digital content added to their exports in the digital era.<br/><br/>Methodology<br/><br/>To estimate the extent of the increase in the contribution of digital services to total exports and sectoral exports, national input-output tables (derived from WIOD) for 43 countries for 2007 and 2014 are used. Further, using Leontief decomposition (in the R package), value added by digital services to total exports is estimated. Estimations are also carried out at a disaggregated sectoral level. The analyses are undertaken for all 43 countries for which national input-output tables are available in the database. These are mostly developed countries but BRIC nations, Indonesia, and Taiwan are also included.<br/><br/>Value Added by Digital Services to Total Exports<br/><br/>Using the above methodology, the estimated value added by digital services to the total exports of a few major economies in 2007 and 2014 has been calculated and presented in Table 4. The first column records the value added by digital services to total exports, while the second column excludes exports of digital services from the same. Although India ranks much lower than other countries in many indicators of digital preparedness, the value added by digital services to India's total exports compares favourably with many developing and developed countries.</p><p><br/><br/>In 2007, India ranked third in the world in terms of value added to exports by digital services in absolute terms, which amounted to $35.5 billion as compared to the US' $38.6 billion. In 2014, there was a 46% rise in the value added by digital services to India's total exports, which reached $51.8 billion, maintaining India's rank of third highest in the world. This may have lent a sense of confidence to the industry as well as policymakers with regards to India's competitiveness in the digital world. However, a closer examination of the extent of value added by digital services to exports, excluding exports of digital services themselves (exports of ICT and telecommunications services), paints a very different picture. As reported in Table 4, the value added by digital services to India's total exports in 2014-excluding exports of digital services-is only around $5.9 billion as compared to the $34.2 billion and China's $23.3 billion. This highlights the lopsided digitalisation of India's exports, which is focused mainly on exports of digital services-computer programming, consultancy and related activities, information service activities, and telecommunications.<br/><br/>Table 5 reports sector-wise estimates of value added by digital services to India's exports in 2014. The majority of the $51.8 billion in value added by digital services in 2014 was concentrated in just a few sectors. Two sectors-computer programming, consultancy and related activities, and information service activities, and telecommunications-accounted for 84.5% and 4% of the total value added by digital services. Among the other sectors, only two-textiles, wearing apparels, and leather products, and chemicals and chemical products-had a share equal to or greater than 1%.</p><p><br/><br/>In textiles, wearing apparels, and leather products, the value added by digital services to exports amounts to only 2.3%, while in the manufacture of computer, electronics, and optical products, value addition is highest at 10.1%, followed by printing and air transport. The above results show that India's digitalisation has been concentrated in very few sectors, while in countries like China and the US, digitalisation is experienced across many sectors.<br/><br/>Table 6 (p 60) compares sectoral shares of value added by digital services to the exports of India, China, and the US. The results show that while the value added by digital services in India is highly concentrated in the exports of digital services, in China and the US, value is added to exports in many sectors. The share of computer programming and related services and telecommunications is around 25% in China and 42% in the US, compared to India's 88%. Eighteen sectors out of 34 contribute more than 1% share in China compared to three sectors in India and 16 sectors in the US. In China, sectors which account for more than 3% of the total value added by digital services include manufacturing of computer, electronic, and optical products, manufacturing of electrical equipment, manufacturing of machinery and equipment, manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, and leather products, wholesale trade, and water transport. This indicates that in terms of adding digital content to its<br/><br/>exports, India lags far behind China and the US. India lags far behind China and the US in almost all sectors-except exports of digital services-in terms of digital content in exports.</p><p><br/><br/>Further, in absolute terms, India has very low digital content in its sectoral exports compared to China and the US. Figure 3 compares value added by digital services in exports of selected sectors in China, India, and the US. The only sector where the value added by digital services in India is higher than that of China is in exports of coke and petroleum products. This data highlights India's lack of digital preparedness in the context of international trade compared to some of its key competitors.</p><p><br/><br/>Need for a Digitally Informed Foreign Trade Policy<br/><br/>To remain competitive in global trade, India needs to boost the digital content in its exports, develop its digital infrastructure and skills, and increase the use of digital technologies in the export-oriented sectors of its economy. While many initiatives within the Digital India programme aim to accelerate India's digital transformation, and a national e-commerce policy is also being prepared, there is an urgent need for a much more holistic approach towards digitalisation in order to improve the digital content in India's exports. E-commerce development may help link exporters to digital platforms and give them access to global markets but if their exportable products have lower digital content, they will not be able to successfully compete in the global market in the digital era. Further, e-commerce platforms also allow international sellers to access India's domestic markets with more competitive products that have more digital content. This may lead to the erosion of domestic market shares of Indian producers. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a Digitally Informed Foreign Trade Policy (DIFTP) for India with the objective of increasing the digital content of India's exports and enhancing use of digital services, skills, and technologies in the trade sector, especially in traditional export sectors.<br/><br/>Setting up a DIFTP would involve building digital infrastructure for trade: enhancing the digital connectivity of traders, promoting digital skills in export sectors, developing data infrastructure for trade, fostering digital start-ups-especially in tradable sectors-encouraging the use of digital technologies and digital services in traditional export sectors, and promoting national digital platforms.<br/><br/>The Indian government has already initiated India Stack, a unique digital infrastructure project that allows governments, businesses, start-ups, and developers to utilise presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery. In 2009, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was set up to empower the citizens of India with a unique identity, Aadhaar, and a digital platform to authenticate users anytime anywhere. This was followed by the launch of the Aadhaar payments bridge and the Aadhaar-enabled payment system, which used the unique identity to electronically channelise government benefits and subsidies. In 2012, e-know your customer (eKYC) was launched, allowing businesses to perform customer verification digitally using biometric or mobile one-time password (OTP). This was followed by the launching of eSign by the Controller of Certifying Authorities in 2015, which allowed Aadhaar holders to digitally sign documents. This was accompanied by a national platform called DigiLocker, which allowed official documents and certificates to be issued and verified digitally, eliminating the need for physical documents. In 2016, the National Payments Corporation of India launched the Unified Payments Interface to revolutionise digital payments in India.<br/><br/>India's foreign trade policy needs to keep pace with these initiatives and incorporate them to boost the digitalisation of the country's international trade. These schemes, if used effectively to inform the foreign trade policy, can greatly improve India's trade competitiveness. For example, there is a need to redesign and digitalise India's farm subsidies, the current of implementation of which can be challenged in the WTO. These schemes can use the Aadhaar payments bridge as well as eKYC and eSign to protect farmers' agricultural revenues through alternative subsidy systems like the US's agricultural subsidies, which are direct payments. This would not only boost agricultural production, but also exports, by making farmers more attuned to digital payments and trade.<br/><br/>Digital Initiatives Needed<br/><br/>India's traditional export sectors also need to be injected with digital initiatives under DIFTP. First and foremost, there is a need to protect national digital platforms. Digital platforms are the backbone of global digital trade and are fast emerging as global monopolies which extract ever-increasing rents. Global digital platforms have the power to reorganise sectors and global trade. Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Alibaba, along with others like Uber and Airbnb, are rising global platforms which are wiping away competition due to their network effects and the associated power of data analytics. India's DIFTP needs to initiate national infant platform protection schemes. These platforms can incentivise domestic producers to export and provide access to new markets to existing exporters. The national e-commerce policy needs to be designed around this objective. Public-private partnerships could be encouraged to form national e-commerce platforms to boost exports and use the data analytics of engaged customers to forecast future demand, and changing tastes and preferences. Linking domestic producers to the national e-commerce platforms can be made a part of national trade promotion schemes. Chinese e-commerce platform policies can provide rich learnings for India. For example, a Chinese e-commerce platform called Kikuu, operates in six African countries, selling only Chinese goods.<br/><br/>Building digital infrastructure for trade is the key to building trade competitiveness in the digital era. While a lot of emphasis has been laid on building ICT infrastructure, there is a need to shift focus to building data infrastructure. Many developing countries have started developing their national data policies. For example, Rwanda has initiated a national data policy. Data needs to be stratified into different categories and classifications to identify data that can be made available publicly for big data analytics, data that needs to be analysed by the government before being shared with key stakeholders, and data that cannot be shared with foreign firms. Further, developing digital skills like designing using computer-aided design and building software must be prioritised, especially in traditional export sectors like textiles, clothing, and leather products. Many countries have initiated digital education in schools and universities, and are now offering courses on building digital skills. Special courses need to be initiated for training the workforce in trade sectors to use digital technologies and digital services.<br/><br/>The DIFTP should use big data analytics to inform trade policy and promote trade. While personal data is protected under the right to privacy in India, non-personal real-time data needs to be analysed by the government for trade trends, existing opportunities, and upcoming challenges for designing trade policies and for trade promotion. Trade policy in many countries is now informed by big data analytics. For example, companies such as Panjiva in the US employ intelligent feature extraction based on machine learning to aggregate and derive custom transaction information through analytics, which they use to provide decision-makers with actionable trade information, like how developing countries are shifting their product mix in response to new competitors (World Bank 2017). Such information can provide a competitive edge to a country's trade policy. Schemes also need to be developed to provide big data analytics support to small and medium enterprises to guide their future production and export destinations, especially if the traditional trade sectors are to remain globally competitive. Lack of such support can endanger India's international market shares in the traditional export sectors.<br/><br/>Apart from providing digital infrastructure for trade and support for the use of big data analytics to inform trade policy and domestic producers, there is a need to maintain policy space for including DIFTP in future trade and investment agreements, especially the multilateral trade agreements at the WTO. It is essential that no agreement is signed which restricts the policy space for regulating cross-border data flows of the Indian government. Since data is the core resource in a digital economy, it needs to be owned by the national government and stored locally. Data provides a competitive edge in international trade in the digital world. For example, in traditional export sectors like textiles, wearing apparels, and leather products, consumer data provides a competitive advantage as it can be used in conjunction with big data analytics and AI to forecast demand, customise production, and determine international demand. Data localisation restrictions give governments the authority to control and regulate data. However, if data is stored in the cloud by foreign firms outside the national boundary, then governments cannot stop the use or abuse of data by foreign firms as it lies outside their jurisdiction. Further, there is a need to develop national digital skills and digital technologies for which technology transfers from foreign firms become imperative. Any agreements, especially at the multilateral level, that restrict the ability of the governments to control or regulate data and develop national digital skills and technologies through promotion of technology transfer measures should not be signed.<br/><br/>Many proposals on e-commerce that are pending at the WTO can have far-reaching implications on the policy space around data flows (WTO 2016a, 2016b). These proposals, if accepted, will not allow governments to have the freedom to make rules around localisation of data and restricting cross-border flow of data, both of which are needed to enable the governments to own and regulate the data of their citizens. Further, governments will not be able to make policies to encourage technology transfers through source code sharing. Foreign firms, when exporting services to India using digital technologies, need to be encouraged to share their source code. China adopted a policy which forced tech firms to share their source code, set up research and development centres in China, and build hardware and software back doors to enable Chinese officials to monitor their data. The monopolistic powers and anti-competitive practices of international digital platforms also need to be addressed within the DIFTP as the boundaries between trade and investments blur, especially with the rise of digital platforms.<br/><br/>Given the rise in the use of 3D printing and its potential as a future mainstream manufacturing process, it is important to carefully examine proposals regarding custom duties on electronic transmissions in the WTO. The import of computer-aided designs used in 3D printing along with other digitalised products, if not monitored through custom duties, can change the trade patterns of the economy. Many countries like Indonesia are implementing custom duties on electronic transmissions like e-books and software (Jakarta Post 2017). India too needs to consider taking control of products being imported through electronic transmissions with custom duties and oppose the permanent moratorium.<br/><br/>India needs to revisit the traditional approach to foreign trade policy and adapt it to the digital world with an emphasis on regulating and using data, and developing digital infrastructure and Information Technology to promote trade and inform trade policy in order to remain globally competitive. Sri Lanka has formed a Ministry of Digital Infrastructure and Information Technology to build its digital capacities. Such a ministry can draw expertise from other ministries in charge of subjects like ICT, trade, technology, and industry.<br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>1 Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it  is Friday June 16th.  Your top stories right now 6:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news this morning.  The Leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The  Associated Press reporting Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot  confirm the news but we are watching what's coming out of Russia this  morning.  What it means for the war on terror coming up this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A show of unity yesterday at the congressional baseball game last night,  both teams coming together for a prayer for their colleague Congressman  Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.</p><p> And President Trump praise lawmakers in the video message right before.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  by playing tonight, you are  showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of  violence or assaults on our democracy.  The game will go on.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the unity was short-lived unfortunately.

The company  forced to apologize after a barista handed her cup that read \"build a wall\"  instead of her name.</p><p> Futures indicating the markets to open this way.  Take a look at where we  stand with three and a half hours before opening bell.  The Dow industrials  expect to open higher this morning.  They got the firmer tone.  Dow  Industrial up 25.

The FTSE 100 in London  up two-thirds of one percent.  And the CAC quarante up three quarters of  one percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close.  The Asian markets, as  you see.  Nikkei average in Japan up half a percent.  Hang Seng also  higher.  Although the Shanghai Composite in China was lower.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me right now from  Erin Hills at the U.S. Open, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, BGC  partner, senior strategist and Fox News Contributor, Steve Cortes.  Great  to see you.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Beautiful morning here at Erin Hills.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the viewers get to see it but it's impossible to capture  even over TV or in word as the suns comes up here.  How gorgeous it is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely beautiful.  They were just mowing the lawn, getting  ready for tee off in about an hour and a half.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It speaks to the kind of hospitality and the warmth and beauty  that we've experienced here.</p><p> CORTES:  It's called welcome to the Midwest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like how you're the self-appointed ambassador and you're from  Illinois.</p><p> CORTES:  I'm from Chicago not very far away.  But it is amazing this early  in the morning here in the course.  The serenity of the place.  It won't be  serene in a few hours.  It'll be ruckus with a lot of people, a lot of golf  going on.  But it's an incredible setting.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  Good word, serenity, I like that.</p><p> Meanwhile, ISIS leader apparently reportedly killed.  We're going to be  talking about that, big story there.  President Trump said a long time ago,  let Russia help us on this.</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, and listen, obviously, I think this is -- not that we want  to celebrate that but this is good news, I think for the world and you're  exactly right.  I'm clearly a President Trump partisan.  We worked hard in  his campaign.  But he was right that we have no allusions that Russia is  our friend, generally.  I think they're more foe than friend.  But there  are times when we have common interest.  And when it comes to ISIS, we have  a very common interest in the Islamist terror.  And so we should welcome  their participation and their help and I think this is great news.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  Well, this is great news if they actually killed the leader of  ISIS which is what we're hearing this morning.</p><p> Coming up this morning joining the conversation the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson is with us this morning.  President of the Jacob Leinenkugel  Brewing Company, Dick Leinenkugel is with us.  Texas Congressman Brian  Babin is here.  And the CEO of Harley-Davidson, Matt Levatich is with us as  well.</p><p> We've got a big show ahead.  So do stay with us throughout.</p><p> First off, we kick it off right now to the -- with what could be a major  military victory for Russia.  The country this morning is claiming that it  may have killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria.  In a statement  issued to Russian news agencies, the defense ministries says that the  country's Air Force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria.  The group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p> A top U.S. military spokesperson tells Fox News they cannot confirm the  report at this time, previous reports of al-Baghdadi death has been false.   Raqqa, of course, has been attacked on the ground and by the air by  American-backed Kurdish and Arab forces which have been closing in on the  terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now, republican congressman Chuck Fleischmann of  Tennessee.  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> CHUCK FLEISCHMANN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, TENNESSEE:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  If true, how significant a development is this in the fight  against ISIS?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Oh, it's very significant.  There needs to be a world combat  against ISIS.  ISIS has been bad.  They have grown, they have spread like a  cancer and anytime that we can take out one of their leaders or deter their  horrible agenda, it's a victory for mankind.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will we get actual confirmation?  I mean, how long do you think  until we know this is actually fact?  Because I know there have been a lot  of rumors that he -- over the last several years, in fact?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  The fact that the rumors are that the Russians actually did  it, it may take a while for the intelligence community to pick that up and  to get confirmation.  But ultimately, whether it was Jihadi John or anybody  else who had a horrible agenda like ISIS, any of these terrorist leaders,  when they have been killed, the truth ultimately always comes out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  But as significant as this  might be the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, American are worried,  Europeans are certainly worried about homegrown terrorists.  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That that's one of the biggest and major concerns.  So to that  point, what is law enforcement, what are the intelligence agencies doing  different or doing an addition to what they have been doing to make sure  that these individuals are rooted out?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let me say this, I experienced homegrown terrorism in  Chattanooga, Tennessee, my hometown, where we lost five brave, great  soldiers and sailors.  There's a horrible attack.  So unfortunately, people  have been radicalized.  The step in the right direction would be to do what  I did.  I entered a bill -- or introduced a bill in the house to basically  combat terrorism here in America.</p><p> So we're trying to combat radicalization wherever it is but I think we do a  better job abroad sometimes than we actually do in the United States.  And  I think our intelligence community is catching up with the reality that  these people with a bad agenda whether it's ISIS, Al-Qaeda or any group of  radical Islamic terrorism has got to be stopped and the best way to do that  is to combat their hateful ideology with proper education and to reach out  and tell people exactly what they are doing.  And one of the best tools in  -- and my bill basically was going to do this.  It was going to take people  who had informally part of this bad organization who had been radicalized,  who've seen the light, who turned good and basically they were going to be  used to combat the spread of this radical horrible ideology.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, let me turn out to the congressional baseball game  last night.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, you witnessed the shooting of your fellow colleague  Steve Scalise and others on Wednesday morning.  You were there, you played  in the game last night.  How did it feel to be out on that field last  night?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  It was probably one of the most special moments that I've  experienced in my entire lifetime.  Since I've been in congress, I've seen  carnage, I alluded to the fact that we lost the five brave Americans in  Chattanooga a couple years ago.  Last night, after having experienced just  the day before the horrors of a gunman, a madman, we saw a great healing.   We showed the American people that whether we're republicans, whether we're  democrats, whether we're partisans or nonpartisans that we do unite when it  comes to the important things.</p><p> Baseball is a great American sport.  I've played it since I've been five  years old.  I'll be 55 in October.  As my coaches telling me, I'm still  good.  I went out there last night and I gave it all but I gave my heart to  Representative Scalise, to Mr. Mica, to the capitol police officers who've  been wounded, actually saving our lives, it's the beginning of a long  healing process.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you give us an update on Steve Scalise?  Do you know  anything new in terms of his condition?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  I do not, other than I heard thank God he was improving.  I  am so thankful that President Trump and Vice President Pence have been able  to visit him.  And I just hope and pray for his full recovery.  He is a  dear friend.  He's more than a colleague.  He is a dear friend.  We have  played baseball together.  We have surfed together.  And he's just a great  American and my heart goes out to him and his family and I pray for a full  and speedy recovery for all involved.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he is.  Thank you so much, congressman.  It's good to have  you on the program this morning.  We'll be watching, thank you.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p> Coming up next, President Trump cracking down on illegal immigration,  cancelling the Obama era policy that protected some from deportation.  How  the change will impact Homeland Security?  We're covering that next.</p><p> Then FiatChrysler recalls nearly 300,000 cars as the auto company says  airbags may unintentionally deploy in certain vehicles.  We've got the  details straight-ahead after this break.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump scrapping in immigration policy  from the Obama administration which protected immigrant parents from being  deported.  Lauren Simonetti on all details right now.  Headlines in New  York.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  Happy Friday, everybody.   President Trump making good on another one of his key campaign promises.   Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly formally revoking the program aimed  at protecting parents and of U.S. citizens and legal residents from being  deported.</p><p> President Obama announced the program back in 2014 but it was never fully  launched because it was apparently blocked by a federal court.  Republicans  criticizing the effort calling it back door amnesty.</p><p> Well, Fiat Chrysler recalling 297,000 minivans in North America for wiring  problem that can lead to unintended airbag deployment.  The recall of 2011  and '12 model year Dodge Grand Caravan minivans has been linked to eight  minor injuries.  The recall will begin in late July.  Dealers will replace  the wiring if needed and add protective covering.</p><p> Say it isn't so.  Butterfingers.  Nestle putting its candy business up for  sale.  The Swiss company trying to get a healthier bottom line as customers  are on the world demand healthier snacks.  The unit could be worth as much  as $3 billion.</p><p> And have you guys seen this one?  A loyal Starbucks customer in Charlotte,  North Carolina says she was targeted for supporting Donald Trump.  Kayla  Hart walked into a Starbucks, as she usually does.  This time she was  wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt and look at this.  She said her order was  labeled with that political message \"build a wall\" instead of her name and  she was ridiculed for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KAYLA HART:  Build a wall and kind of shoves my drink at me and then all of  the baristas in the back started cracking up laughing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hart says she's waiting to hear from the Starbucks district  manager before deciding whether she's going to give them her business once  again, Maria.  Unbelievable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Lauren Simonetti.   That term doesn't seem like a negative insult to me and I would have said,  great.  You would have left.</p><p> CORTES:  I would have absolutely left.  I will tell you this.  As a Trump  guy who campaigned for Trump and who was -- I was accosted on public  transportation several times, complete strangers.  And far worst turns in  that.  I don't think that's insulting, by the way.  Trump campaigned on  build a wall.  So I think -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But they were laughing at her, that's why she was upset.</p><p> CORTES:  And I'm sure they were trying to ridicule her.  And here's the  thing too.  I think it is important -- I think Dagen was mentioning off  camera that a lot of us have lost our sense of humor when it comes to  politics.  Politics had become such blood sport.  Our country is so  divided.  There's times that we can't laugh about it and there are some  things that we should laugh about it.  To me, if somebody showed me that  cup of build a wall, that's funny.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And I would have been like, yeah, build that wall.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, humor has just disappeared in the world of political  discourse.  Could everybody so offended by everything?  I say bring it  back.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that's the right word that he said blood sport.  It has  become blood sport.</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, I do think too.  On a more serious point though too, why  are we so divided?  Right?  And I think we're the most divided.  We should  have been my lifetime and from my read of history, maybe the most since the  civil war, I think possibly, 60's were pretty divisive from what I can  gather.  I wasn't around then.  But in my lifetime I the most divided we've  been.  But why?</p><p> I think a couple of reasons.  One is identity politics which I think have  just run a muck, constantly identifying ourselves by our ethnic group, by  our gender.  I think that that has reached - has extenuated division.  And  then I think secondly and most importantly, slow economic growth.  Economic  anxiety always exacerbates whatever other tensions exist.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Quote Bill Murray and strikes lighten up.  That will actually  reduce a lot of the anger and rage and divisiveness if people can just kind  of step back and take a breath.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> Still ahead, safety concerns for navy jet pilots to report.  Fox News  correspondent Lea Gabrielle will explain why training is currently at a  standstill for trainees.  We'll get into it next.  </p><p> Then our investors losing confidence in Snap.  What about the whole tech  sector?  The fallout after Snap sunk to its IPO price to $70 a share and  then broke it yesterday.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at Snap.  This was one of the  big stories in the stock market yesterday.  It has been anything but  picture perfect for the company.  Since it's Wall Street debut, Snap shares  fell to the IPO price yesterday of $17 a share.  And you know, we have seen  some churn going on in technology in general, right?  A lot of those big  tech names that have been the leadership of this market last year have  turned over.  What do you think about is?</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, I'll say and I've been on air pretty critical of Snapchat  and mainly because here's my sort of grand thesis, is that they sell for  free a product to a lot of people who generally don't have money,  teenagers.  But having said that, people -- I've got three teen daughters  at home, they live on Snap.  I mean, absolutely live on it.  They don't  text -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how do you monetize it?  Are they making money?</p><p> CORTES:  but here's the caveat to all of that and that's my negative  comment on Snap.  But here's my positive comment and this just happened, I  believe, this week, McDonald's is hiring a quarter million workers and  they're going to do it via Snap.  They want their applications to come  which is very interesting to me.  That's very intriguing, it made me  rethink my bearish opinion of the company that if this can become a bit of  a teenager or millennial LinkedIn, well, that's utility then.  That's not  just sort of fun and silliness and that might be a way that they can  actually monetize.</p><p> So anyway, makes me rethink at least.  Back of the IPO price for somebody  who's been pretty skeptical of the company, I'm rethinking that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The issue I have always had with Snap is that it doesn't have  that high barrier to entry and you've seen Facebook and Facebooks,  Instagram innovating on this front and really rolling out Snap-like  features to not only hang onto their existing user base -- but also -- it's  a little windy here at the U.S. Open.  But also to draw -- this is  millennials age, draw people away from Snapchat and I think that that was  something that wasn't priced into the IPO initially, the ease with which  that customers can leave Snapchat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the other tech names?  You're talking  about Amazon, Google, all of the names, Apple, that have been really the  leadership of this market and yet, we're seeing a bit of a pullback?</p><p> CORTES:  I think that it's natural, to put it in context, I think compared  with the rally that they saw, particularly since the election, it's not  that material.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But look at this chart right here.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, I mean, those things are very volatile if you just got in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This week for Amazon.</p><p> CORTES:  But I also think to connect the dots here between markets and  politics.  It's ironic to me that Silicon Valley which is a place where  President Trump is probably not terribly popular, I don't think they're  going to hold a parade.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the understatement of more than so far.</p><p> CORTES:  But it's been wonderful for Silicon Valley.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And next week, the White House is having a technology summit,  all the CEO's of big tech companies have signed on.  They're going to go to  the White House.  They're going to talk about modernizing government.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They certainly want tax reform.  Corporate tax reform.  And that  was one thing that universally every tech CEO was excited about.  So  they're going to give the president and the White House staff an earful  about pushing that harder -- pushing those republicans in congress on that  much harder than they have been.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, then there's Twitter.  Looking to jazz up the brand.   The company rolls out a new design on both the website and the app.  We're  using Twitter all the time.  I just tweeted out the shot of them hosing and  getting the golf course ready.  Is this enough you think to keep investors  happy?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I still think that Twitter wind up getting bought by  somebody.  Because it does have a great installed user base.  A  professionals who use Twitter for basically a news delivery service.   That's how you use it.  But I think in the last week, you've seen one of  the major problems with Twitter and that is the level of hate speech and  vitriol and partisan name calling that has been a problem and that's one of  the reasons that a lot of these potential acquirers of Twitter have turned  away from it because they don't want to be associated with that and you  can't monetize nastiness.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Same problem though.  How do you monetize?</p><p> CORTES:  I do think you're right, Dagen, though.  I do think that there is  a floor relatively close because of that takeover potential.  I'm not  saying that means necessarily buy the stock, but I do think there's  somewhat of an embedded -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who wants it?  We've been down this road before.  Nobody want  it.</p><p> CORTES:  And I will say the same time.  Look, when you have the president  of the United States who has become the Twitter in chief who lives on this  medium and it still can't seem to monetize, right?  That I will admit  that's a problem, that comes from somebody, I use it all day every day for  business reasons, for sports reasons, for fun, it's incredible but I don't  spend a dime.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That goes to the point though.  If you say you follow President  Trump and you retweet everything that he does, Twitter identifies that,  what are they going to sell to you?  What ads are they going to serve to  you other than \"Make America Great Again\" hats and t-shirts?  What does  that say about what type of shampoo or laundry detergent you like?  It  doesn't say anything, quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And also, how you're going to add an advertisement to 140  characters?  You can't.  I mean, there's no advertising revenue model.</p><p> CORTES:  And that's where Facebook, I think, right?  We have learned  clearly was much superior in terms of monetizing, right?  And in terms of  not being limited by the characters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a short break.  When we come back, keeping America  safe.  A reported additional 4,000 troops will be headed to Afghanistan to  break a stalemate with the Taliban.  What the deployment means for  President Trump and the country?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from the U.S. Open at Erin Hills Golf Course in  Wisconsin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  We're thrilled here with us.  It is Friday, June 16th.  Here  are your top stories 6:30 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning.

We've got a  preview of the highly-anticipated new film ahead of the weekend.</p><p> First, though, breaking news this morning, Russia has claimed that it has  killed the head of ISIS.  The country is investigating reports that an  airstrike in Syria took out Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last  month.  The U.S. has not confirmed this death but we're waiting on more  information.  Joining us right now is Fox News Correspondent, former Navy  fighter pilot, Lea Gabrielle.  Lea, thanks for joining the conversation.   What would al-Baghdadi's death mean for the war on terror in your view?</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first off, Maria, I  think we just have to take this with a bit of skepticism at this point.   And I know that the intelligence community and the U.S. military are going  to be looking at evidence and all of our ability to get situational  awareness on this to figure out, did he actually die?  Because there have  been reports in the past even back in 2015, there were reports that he was  killed but then in May of that same year, he released a radio or an audio  message basically urging Muslims to immigrate to the caliphate.  He is  somebody, who there has been essentially a bounty on him for quite some  time.  So it would be significant if he was killed but again, I think at  this point, we have to take it with some skepticism until we hear more from  us officials.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, you are waiting on information.  When do you  expect we will hear - or, I mean, how quickly do you think they can get to  the bottom of it?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's really tough to be able to say right now.  You  know, there are a lot of different sources of information that the U.S.  will be using, we'll be using our own sources of information but also  working with allies and I would expect that the U.S. would also be trying  to get information from Russia to find out what sort of evidence they do  have to assess whether or not he was actually killed. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Lea, training for jet pilots in the U.S. Navy still at a  standstill, I want to get your take on this.  In April, pilots of the  Navy's jet trainer refused to fly because of safety concerns.  You've been  talking about this for a long time, and of course, the Navy ordered a pause  in training while it conducted a review of the problems.  You were first to  obtain the result of the review and you spoke exclusively to the Navy's  number two officer.  Tell us about it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, Maria, the bottom line is that the Navy still can't say  when the T-45, the Navy's only jet trainer will actually start flying  again.  And the report says that finding a solution to the problem has  proved elusive, that's a quote.  In other words, there isn't one yet.  The  issues with the basic life support systems in the both the T-45 trainer and  in the F-18 Hornet, those are systems that are supposed to provide clean  breathable air to the aircrew but reports of incidents where pilots and  crew became impaired have been on the rise, increasing in a lot of models  last year.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I visited with in Virginia Beach for an exclusive look at the  latest technology being used to train F-18 pilots to handle aircraft system  failures that have been plaguing the fleet.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's say we got the feel of the nose there.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  The reduced oxygen breathing device allows pilots to experience  oxygen loss while flying but in the safety of a simulator.  As a former F- 18 pilot, I gave it a try.</p><p> CMDR. JEFF FARMER, VFA-131 COMMANDING OFFICER:  If we can put this oxygen  mask on and slowly decrease that amount of oxygen concentration that we're  getting to simulate as best we can exactly what would the pilot would  experience in the airplane itself.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  All set.  Hands up.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Pilots could become dizzy, euphoric or even pass out.</p><p> Basically, what I fell is (INAUDIBLE) it's severely uncomfortable.  It's  hard to concentrate.</p><p> FARMER:  So far, it's been very successful in helping people recognize  those symptoms before they experience any kind of cognitive or, you know,  worst yet, loss of consciousness.  Your heart rate is coming up a little  bit.  You might notice that yourself.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  One training goal, to recognize the symptoms and pool a green  ring, which gives the pilot up to 10 minutes of emergency oxygen.</p><p> One of the reasons for all this training in a simulator is because pilots  are reporting more problems in planes like these, and when you're flying in  the air in an F-18, it can be a matter of life and death.  In fact, we  learned some pilots are more concerned about their life support systems  failing than the risk of combat.  The pilot we spoke within Virginia  disagree.</p><p> CAPT. MARC MIGUEZ, CARRIER AIR WING THREE COMMANDER:  I see no problems  operating safety under our current mitigation strategy that we're doing  right now.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  The Navy review released just today said it view these episodes  as a number one safety priority and announced an unconstrained resource  approach to finding a solution.  I spoke with Admiral Bill Moran who  ordered the review.</p><p> ADM. BILL MORAN, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS:  The system, the aircraft  ought to operate the way it was designed to operate.  And it's up to us to  figure out how to get that airplane back to that level of performance.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, as you saw in the case of a system failure, pilots have  to manually activate emergency oxygen even if they're impaired.  Admiral  Moran says that an automatic system is the goal.  He also tells me that if  they're not able to get the training site going again by the end of the  summer, it will impact operational readiness.  But, Maria, he said that -  he says that the Navy is getting close.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this a cost issue?  I mean, what does this mean for the F-35  program, and what's behind it, Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's - those are two great questions.  I mean, first of  all, I did ask Admiral Moran about the cost.  And he said that they are  putting all the resources into this.  That cause is not a factor in trying  to solve this problem.  So, it's an unconstrained resource approach, it's  basically what they're calling it in the Navy.  Now, the F-35 is  essentially a different animal, but it's a Navy jet, it's an Air Force jet,  it's a Marine Corps jet, and a wing in Arizona.  Just had to ground the F- 35 because of this type of problem where there were 5 reported incidents.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> Now, reportedly, they're going to start flying again probably this weekend,  but the same issues are impacting the F-35, Maria.  Of course, the F-35  program is an extremely costly program.  It's sort of a jack of all trades  and it's been a struggle making it an airplane that can sort of master so  many different trades, Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You make all great points.  I want to bring the panel in  here because we have been talking about the age of the Navy fleet, the Army  fleet, but we're talking about some of the oldest fleets in decades, and  that is a cost issue.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And General Mattis actually -  I think it was yesterday - made a comment about the sequestration and the  budget, the defense budget cuts that were in that and how devastating that  was, and that it will take years for the defense department to recover from  that.  But however, the upside is that you do have a President now in  Donald Trump dedicated to rebuilding the defense and our - and our  military.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know - yes, I think, Maria, to that point and I'm  sure Lea is correct that this particular issue isn't a cost issues but in  general, I think there's a ton of cost issues.  If you talk to people -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, that's why he's focused on it in the budget.</p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  And if you talk to  people in the military, they will say we are simply not ready.  We're not  ready to fight.  And by the way, it's unconscionable to put our fighting  men and women into the position where they don't have the proper equipment  or training that they need to probably defend America.  And I think it's  one of the reasons that Trump won and to also connect the dots between the  policy here and markets, I think the markets certainly believe that we're  going to spend what we need to if you look at Boeing stocks, for instance.   Boeing hitting another huge all-time high just yesterday.  I think, to me,  that has been really a Trump stock because of combination of defense and  infrastructure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though he was one of the first people that Trump  called out.</p><p> CORTES:  I know.  Ironically.  Ironically, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On Twitter.  Meanwhile, Lea, then there's the war in  Afghanistan.  The Pentagon reportedly planning to send nearly 4,000  additional troops to the country to break the stalemate with the Taliban.   The President gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the power to determine  troop levels in Afghanistan earlier this week.  What's your take on this?   Will this turn the tide of the war?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, it's going to be necessary to turn the tide of the war,  and that's according to the senior commander on the ground there who said  that additional troops are needed in order to do that.  The Taliban  fighting season is about to get underway there, so I think that that's  probably part of the reason for this decision right now, but of course,  Secretary Mattis has just said that we are not winning there.  So, the only  way to win is to increase the number of troops level and I think - troop  levels, and I think that that's what they're trying to do.  They -- the  Pentagon is reviewing the strategy in Afghanistan, and the Secretary of  Defense said that that may take several weeks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a stunning comment that Secretary Mattis made the  other day, wasn't it, that we are not winning in Afghanistan.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  Well - and you know, listen, I think the honesty is  important, all right.  And then, how do we address it?  How do we start to  win?  And perhaps 4,000 more troops is the first step there.  I will tell  you I'm normally on board with the Trump administration on just about  everything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CORTES:  I worry about us escalating Afghanistan.  I worry about the  quagmire, we've been there for a heck of a long time, and we really won  over the hearts and minds of the people, I'm not so sure, but I do love the  honesty of the analysis of the situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It certainly was.  Lea, great to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lea Gabrielle there.  Coming up, from clicks to bricks,  Amazon's new patent that could stop in-store customers from comparing the  company's prices online.  We'll tell you about that coming next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're live from beautiful Erin Hills this morning in Wisconsin  for the 117th U.S. Open.  We have the very latest on the Open day two here  in Erin Hills.  Welcome back.  We're looking at markets that are going to  be opening higher this morning.  Futures are indicating some firmness right  here.  Take a look at the Dow Industrials up about 20 points, NASDAQ up  about 9 points, fractionally off of the highs of the morning.  </p><p> A couple names we're watching this morning, Kroger is one to watch, for  sure.  Shares of the grocery giant fell nearly 20 percent yesterday after  the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast.  Kroger blamed the  move on higher product costs.  Kroger shares this morning are fractionally  higher.  We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent  that can stop in-store shoppers from comparing prices on their phones.  The  technology allows stores to see what a shopper is searching for while  connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can then take action like e-mail a  coupon or suggesting comparable items, even block access to competitive  content.  Amazon shares are up this morning.  I don't know if I like this  technology.  What do you guys think about that?</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  It's a bit Big Brother-ish but then again -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's very Big Brother-ish.</p><p> CORTES:  -- you also don't have to get on their Wi-Fi, right?  Just do it  on your - I'm not sure that -- I don't think that - I'm no techie, but I  don't think Amazon could stop you from just being on your mobile signal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But if you want to go online and see if a -- you can get a  product somewhere else cheaper, you should be able to.  I don't know if I'm  in Amazon or not.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's my two cents on it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, a nationwide manhunt ended in triumph for Tennessee  law enforcement yesterday.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details in New  York this morning.  She's got headlines.  Lauren?</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Quite a story, Maria.   Two inmates who escaped from a Georgia prison back on Tuesday, they were  captured after attempting to steal a Tennessee man's car.  Police say the  man held the fugitives at gunpoint with a neighbor until law enforcement  came to arrest them.  Prior to this, the pair held a Tennessee couple  hostage in their home, tying them up with a rope, eating their food, and  stealing their stuff.  </p><p> Well, Ricky Dubose and Donnie Rowe, there they are, both serving time for  armed robbery.  They escaped the Putnam County jail after shooting two  prison guards and driving off in a hijacked vehicle.  They are being  extradited back to Georgia where they will face multiple charges.  Nike  wants to be quicker on its feet so it's cutting 1400 jobs and eliminating a  quarter of its shoe styles as it faces increase competition from smaller  brands and premium labels, all part of a plan to also start selling  sneakers more directly to customers online.</p><p> Big win for Netflix, leapfrogging cable T.V.  According to a new study,  Netflix have more 50 million subscribers last quarter, that's 2 million  more than cable marketing.  The first time Netflix has taken the lead.  </p><p> And Jean Simmons says the horns are mine.  The longtime member of Kiss has  filed an application with the U.S. patent and trademark office Friday to  claim his official ownership of that hand gesture right there, the horns.   His legal team included a sketch of the gesture, plus a picture of him  using it.  A trademark typically protects brand names and logos on goods  and services, but now maybe hand gestures, too.  Maria, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  So, what do you - what do you guys  think?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is the dumbest idea ever.  This is not associated with  Kiss.  I do this every time I did \"RED EYE\" and every time I do \"KENNEDY\".   It's just -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you didn't get it from him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's having a (INAUDIBLE) I don't listen to Kiss.  And by the  way, how about the Texas Longhorns.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  I was going to say.  For the - for the Texas Longhorn  nation, they will view this as their Alamo to fight against losing - right?  - the hook and horns.  He might as well trademark the thumbs-up, right?   Now - but having said all of that, this is -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now, Donald Trump is going to -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, it's a thumbs down and -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CORTES:  Jean Simmons is a marketing genius and he might have done this for  this exact reason.  We're talking about him, he's been shown on air.  So  perhaps -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You got us, Jean.  You got us.</p><p> CORTES:  Perhaps his method (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, make me pay for this.  Make me pay to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, will the new Cars movie drive into the number one  spot at the box office this weekend?  Are you going to the film, have a  kid-friendly flick?  We'll we stack up next to Wonder Woman.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we get some pictures?  </p><p> MCQUEEN:  Yes, yes.  Come on, let's get a picture.  You know what, get  (INAUDIBLE) picture because champ here has been a role model of mine for  years now, and I mean, a lot of years, right?  I love this guy.  I think I  touched a nerve.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from the new Disney Pixar film Cars 3, hitting  theaters this weekend.  It's the third installment in a series which  follows racecar Lightning McQueen as he struggles with growing older.</p><p> Joining us right now in the Fox Light host and Senior Vice President of  Marketing at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:   Maria, good to see you.  Where is everyone?  Again, I'm alone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're here at the U.S. Open.  We're here at Erin Hills.  We  wish you were - we wish you were here, Michael.  So, let me ask you about  Cars because Wonder Woman is still on fire, right?  But the last Cars film  grossed $66 million opening weekend at the box office.  What are you  expecting?  You think it stacks up against the record-breaking Wonder Woman  this weekend?</p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  I think it's going to - in this - the fast lane to  number one at this weekend's box office.  Look, Wonder Woman is probably  going to be the movie of the summer 2017.  It's on track to get about $500  million so far, and is opening up in 7 more markets across the globe this  weekend, but Cars?  Look, we're hearing a lot about franchise fatigue this  summer between Aliens and Pirates of the Caribbean.  This is one franchise  that is still hot.  It looks to take in 55 about to $60 million this  weekend, pretty good.  Not bad for Disney which has had an incredible year  between Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's another family-friendly movie, which is always  loved.  By the way, last weekend, I saw Wonder Woman.  I thought it was  good.</p><p> TAMMERO:  What did you think?  Fantastic, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I liked it a lot.  I - well, I didn't know the story  of when she was a young girl, so that was interesting.  But here we are at  Erin Hills, Michael, and you ranked the top three golf films of all time in  honor of our live coverage from the U.S. Open.  Give me your number three  pick.</p><p> TAMMERO:  We did.  I asked people on social media and it was almost  consensus.  No one agrees on social media but everyone said these three  movies.  So, number three, Maria, of the top golf movies of all time,  debuted in 1996, Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, and Don  Johnson.  The story about a washed-up golf pro working at a driving range  who tries to qualify for the U.S. Open in order to win the heart of his  successful girlfriend.  It debuted at number one and earned about $53  million at the box office.  That was a good story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a great story.  One of my faves, Dagen.  And you - and  you and I love Kevin Costner.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love that movie and I love the fact that it's basically like  my Major League because Rene Russo was in Major League with Tom Barringer,  so it just made (INAUDIBLE) golf.  It's a very similar storyline, actually.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Probably the last thing for Don Johnson, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  He was good in that, too.  It was a great  film.  I don't know if that would be my number three pick, it might even be  - it might be my number two, but what is your number two pick, Michael?</p><p> TAMMERO:  Number two, 1996, Adam Sandler.  I feel like old Adam Sandler  movies should be introduced with a sigh.  Happy Gilmore debuted at number  two at the box office, bringing in about $38 million.  A rejected hockey  player puts his skills to the golf course to save his grandmother's house.   One of the big hits of Adam Sandler but not his biggest.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, Maria, we can only hope that Bob Barker is going to get in a  fight somewhere today on Erin Hills, right, and reenact my favorite scene  from that movie.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a great movie, it was so funny.  We will see about  that.  All right.  We are down to number one, Michael, and I think we all  agree this is set certainly a winner.  Let's take a look at the clip from  your number one pick.  Watch this.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Let's do it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This crowd has gone deadly silent.  Cinderella story.   I don't know where, a former greenskeeper, now about to become the Masters  champion.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It looks like I'm going to rack.  It's in the whole.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Caddyshack.  Who can doubt this is probably the top golf movie of  all time?  It debuted at number one, $39 million at the box office back in  1980, starring Chevy Chase, what a cast, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill  Murray, all chasing that little gopher around the golf course blowing  things up, which is what I want to do when I play golf because I'm awful at  it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Ted Knight makes it, right, as Judge Smails?</p><p> TAMMERO:  That's right.  Not to be confused with -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Not to be confused with Caddyshack 2, starring Jackie Mason,  which was just god-awful.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God, you're right.  I forgot about that.  So, why was  Caddyshack your - Caddyshack your top pick?  It's - I mean, I know  everybody online liked it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, it's funny, I watched it last night and it holds up.   It's a classic movie from the 80s.  You know, Bill Murray and Rodney  Dangerfield at their best.  I recommend everyone this weekend celebrate the  U.S. Open and go back and watch it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a great point.  Yes, you're right, it was really funny.   Michael, great to see you.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Good to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael Tammero joining us there.  Still, ahead, more from the  beautiful grounds of Erin Hills here in Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open,  as round two is kicking off next hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay right  here.

Happy Friday -- everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us here in Erin Hills, Wisconsin.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, June 16th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning -- the leader of ISIS reportedly has been  killed.  The Associated Press reporting that Russia is claiming that it  killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the  U.S. military says that they cannot confirm this news but the President has  long stressed that getting help is the way to take down ISIS.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have a lot of  great success over the next coming years.  And we want to get as many to  help fight terrorism as possible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What this means to the war on terrorism, coming up this  morning.</p><p> Meanwhile Facebook ramps up its efforts against extremist content. The  social media giant is now turning to artificial intelligence to do so.  We  will have the details.</p><p> A show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  are coming together for a prayer for their colleague; Congressman Steve  Scalise still in critical condition.  They did that ahead of the first  pitch last night.</p><p> Scalise underwent another surgery.  He is still in critical condition but  the hospital says his condition has improved in the last 24 hours.</p><p> New details this morning on the health of Otto Warmbier, the American  detainee just released from North Korea.  The 22-year-old has extensive  brain damage and is in a persistent vegetative state.</p><p>Amazon reportedly eyeing an acquisition, the retail giant now looking to  get into the messaging space.  Why they may see Slack as a growth  opportunity.</p><p> And futures indicating a higher opening for markets this morning -- take a  look.  This Friday morning, we're looking at money moving into stocks.  Dow  Industrials up about 20 points.  Nasdaq up about 10 points, fractional  moves, nonetheless in the plus-plus column.</p><p> In Europe, similar story -- stocks are higher across the board in the  Eurozone.  The indices look like this.  FT100 up two-thirds of 1 percent as  is the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX index in Germany up a quarter of a  percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, mostly higher in fact.  Best  performer was Japan -- Nikkei average up one-half of 1 percent.</p><p> It is day two of the U.S. Open.  It is getting underway shortly.  We have a  recap of yesterday's action. Everything you need to know as golfers tee up  today.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk about it,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and BGC Partners senior strategist  Fox News contributor Steve Cortes with us as well.</p><p> I'm looking forward to hearing the claps.  It's just so relaxing when you  see them beginning to tee off.  </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  As I mentioned before, a golf  course in the morning this early -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CORTES:  -- there is a certain serenity.  But there won't be serenity soon.   They'll be cheering and a raucous nature to this place and it's exciting.   I am so glad as a Midwesterner that the U.S. Open has decided to come back  to the Midwest.  And I think -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like how you being from Chicago, from Illinois, you're taking  credit.  </p><p> CORTES:  I've appointed myself.  I'm not going to tell people of Wisconsin  -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's like me taking credit, for like the way people get  treated in Alabama, for example.</p><p> CORTES:  And here at a relatively new golf course which is also unique.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's just talk about yesterday.  The players have never played  this course.  And it's a different course.  It's real long -- what was the  tallying (ph) of yesterday?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Nine miles.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nine miles they're walking as opposed to six miles, which is  sort of the average.  </p><p> CORTES:  Right.  And hilly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And hilly.</p><p> CORTES:  No, I think it definitely will favor -- a hot day yesterday.   We'll see what it's like today and into the weekend.  Nice and cool now,  but we'll see once the sun comes up.</p><p> I think that tends to favor the fitter golfers, the younger golfers.  So  it's a more physical test perhaps than they're used on some other courses.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big story of the day, of course, the head of ISIS may have been  killed.  We want to follow that this morning.</p><p> Coming up talking all about it this morning and joining the conversation is  the CEO of Kalahari Resort Todd Nelson is here; the President of Jacob  Leinenkugel Brewing Company Dick Leinenkugel; Texas Congressman Brian Babin  is with us; and the CEO of Harley-Davidson Matthew Levatich is with us as  well; plus PGA Tour Superstore president and CEO Dick Sullivan is with us  as well.  He'll give us an update on what we're seeing today in golf and  the golf business in general.</p><p> First though, our top story this hour.  What could be a major military  victory for Russia -- the country claiming that it may have killed ISIS  leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria one month ago.  In the statement  issued through Russian news agencies, the defense ministry there says that  the country's air force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria the group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p> Now the U.S. military says that it cannot confirm this news yet.  We're  waiting for more confirmation from the U.S.  But Raqqa, of course, has been  under attack on the ground and by air by American-backed Kurdish and Arab  forces which have been closing in on the terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now is a former army intelligence officer Andrew Peek.   Andrew -- thanks so much for weighing in here.  What do you think this  means in the fight against ISIS?</p><p> ANDREW PEEK, FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Well, gosh -- if Russian  forces killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic state it would  be singlehandedly the biggest justification for Donald Trump's foreign  policy to date.  You know, I think it would really be a massive stamp of  approval for his efforts to reach out to Russia and to make concessions in  other parts of the world like Eastern Europe in exchange for getting more  cooperation against the Islamic state in Syria and Iraq.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because even during the campaign, then candidate Trump said  many times -- look ok, Russia may not be our friend but there's no reason  we should not be working side-by-side with them against terrorism, against  ISIS.  Let them take him out.  He said it many times.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  That's exactly right.  And he took a lot of heat from that  because that was on the heels of not just Russia interfering potentially  with the DNC e-mails and the election hacking but also about a year after  Russia had essentially invaded Ukraine and fomented a massive insurgency in  that country.</p><p> So there was a lot of legacy weight of hostility with Russia that frankly  actually mirrored what Obama came into office with in 2009 after the  Georgia war in August 2008.  However, if Baghdadi is actually dead, that  would be a mark of approval for Trump's foreign policy and really I think  put to rest a lot of the conspiracy theories in this town in Washington  about his obeisance to Moscow.  </p><p> CORTES:  Well, you know -- hey, Steve Cortes here -- I have a question for  you.  I mean I think, you know, when we look at history for instance, we  teamed up with Stalin, very unsavory Russian character right, to take on  Hitler.  Can't we at times -- doesn't it just make good common sense for us  at times to team up with people who may be disreputable or may not have our  best interests at heart but when we have a common interest, such as  defeating ISIS doesn't it just make good strategic sense for us to then  unite as we have in this case against ISIS?  </p><p> PEEK:  No, I think it does.  I think the challenge has been in Syria that  we have two goals.  It's not just defeating ISIS but it's also replacing it  with a regime that is not Bashar al-Assad because Assad keeps gassing his  own people.  And unfortunately that is Russia's goal.</p><p> So we've been looking for a third way that involves defeating ISIS but not  winding up with Bashar al-Assad back in control of Syria.  And what I think  you have seen Trump do is make the decision that at least in the interim we  are not going to pursue both goals simultaneously.  We're going to get rid  of ISIS and then we're going to move on afterwards to dealing with the  political transition in Syria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the comment that Secretary Mattis made the other day  that we are not winning in Afghanistan.  What's your take on that --  Andrew?</p><p> PEEK:  Frankly if we weren't winning with 100,000 troops in Afghanistan  under Obama I don't know why we're going to be winning with 12,000 under  Donald Trump.  I don't know what additional difference another 4,000 troops  is going to make.  I think that that is the stopgap measure.</p><p> I think it kicks the ball down the road for when we have to have the  politically really hard discussion of when are we going to pull most of our  people out.  I think we were at the border of having that about a year ago.   I think the issue is going to be funding for the Afghan government going  forward.  But I truly don't see why 4,000 troops is going to make a big  difference.</p><p> I have to say I have the greatest respect for the commander on the ground,  Nick Nicholson.  We served together there, very smart guy, cream in the  army but I don't see this being a game changer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Andrew -- let me ask you about social media here because  Facebook is tapping artificial intelligence now.  They say it's a new push  to block terrorist propaganda.  The social media giant says that it will  use algorithms to root out words and images related to extremism.  Facebook  is using a team of 150 members including counterterrorism experts to take  down related posts.  Do you think this is enough?  What do you make of this  push by Facebook?  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  I don't really trust the tech companies to decide what is and  what isn't extremist speech.  You know, I think I don't want to always put  the onus on political correctness but these are West Coast companies that  over the long term are not going to be able to say hey, we're only going to  focus on Islamic radicalism and Islamic hate speech.</p><p> I think there is going to be a strong temptation to move into all kinds of  extremist speech however they want to define that from radical Islam to  radical right-wing groups to radical left-wing groups.  And that is  gradually going to bleed over into political discourse.</p><p> What I would like to see is more effort on the backend from the  intelligence community and not frankly kind of the front end with the tech  companies censoring the narrative.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Andrew, that's been one of the problems is that people cried  out that as conservatives, that their speech had been shut down by  Facebook.  You know, anytime anything is flagged by another Facebook user,  you basically get ixnayed on the site while they have allowed these sites  particularly Twitter was worse than Facebook for a very long time in terms  of allowing just rampant propaganda. </p><p> This is something that needed to happen quite frankly and they are doing it  because they would rather do it themselves than then allow the government  end because again if they don't take control of it, I'll tell you what,  folks from the government absolutely will.</p><p> And which is one more thing, these tech companies for some time legally had  to police and look for and take down and report to authorities child  pornography.  And they had automated ways to do that and they pushed back  and said well, we can't do that with terrorist propaganda but it turns out  they can and they are.  </p><p> PEEK:  Dagen -- I think that is true but the only reason they are now  pushing back on the radical Islamic themes is that they have a president  who is putting the political pressure on them, right.  Once that  administration changes, and at some point, of course it will, the pressure  is going to be off and they're going to go back to censoring a whole array  of messages at best; and at worst, none at all.</p><p> So that's really a function, there is no institutional way on the tech  companies.  It's really a function of Trump's focus on calling the enemy  radical Islam.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's great insight from you as always -- Andrew.  Thanks  so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p> PEEK:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Andrew Peek joining us there in New  York.</p><p> Coming up, grave new health concerns for the 22-year-old held hostage by  North Korea for over a year.  Why U.S. doctors now are disputing the claims  that Otto Warmbier was in a coma -- those claims from North Korea. </p><p> And a touching tribute to the original Hollywood hero -- how Los Angeles  honored Batman star Adam West last night.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open this morning.  It is round two, at least  -- meanwhile ten tornadoes have touched down in northeast Wisconsin.  That  happened yesterday.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti with the details now -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  An hour and a half from you -- Maria.</p><p> One of those tornadoes first hit in Fox Crossing yesterday afternoon,  leaving a trail of damage six miles long.  The twister had peak winds of 95  miles an hour.  Police say one man was injured by flying debris when the  roof of a car wash was torn off in Kimberly.  The local utility says the  tornado outbreak's the largest storm even it's seen since 2010.</p><p> Well, parents, you'll want to listen to this one.  A study by an  environmental group finds detectable levels of lead in 20 percent of baby  food samples.  Those samples were taken by the FDA over a 10-year period.   The types of baby food most affected -- grapes, apples, pears, mixed fruit  juices, sweet potatoes, carrots and teething biscuits.  Studies have shown  that children exposed to lead can experience behavioral problems and have  lower IQs as a result.</p><p> And doctors say an American college student released from captivity this  week by North Korea has extensive brain damage.  Otto Warmbier was held for  17 months in a North Korean jail.  Doctors describe his condition as a --  and this is a quote -- \"a state of unresponsive wakefulness.  Otto's  father, Fred Warmbier, was a guest on Fox News' \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\"  last night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FRED WARMBIER, FATHER OF OTTO WARMBIER:  This is a rogue pariah regime.   They are terrorists.  They are brutal.  There's no sense to anything here.   They have crossed a line with my son, Otto, and so it would be very  difficult to look for a lesson here amongst this insanity.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  We feel for that family.  Otto Warmbier serving a 15-year  sentence for allegedly trying to steal a political poster that contains a  slogan that he wanted to take from a wall in his hotel room in Pyongyang.</p><p> And L.A. turned into Gotham City once again last night.  This, to honor the  late Adam West, who played Batman on the TV show in the 1960s.  West died  last week at the age of 88.  At an L.A. city hall ceremony officials and  hundreds of fans were joined by Catwoman Lee Meriwether, Catwoman and Burt  Ward.  He played Robin on the \"Batman\" series.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURT WARD, FORMER ACTOR:  He spent his entire life as a performer making  people happy, making them laugh and trying to make this world a better  place.  So thank you for coming out.  Wowie-zowie.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  And then the L.A. police chief lit the bat signal, there it is,  summoning the caped crusader one final time.  And we say -- holy tribute,  Batman -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love that.  Thank you so much -- Lauren.</p><p> Still ahead, putting Cuba relations back on ice.  President Trump prepares  to roll back relations with Havana.  This is expected in the next couple of  days.  What it means for businesses investing in the country.</p><p> And then your next business convention could be fun for the whole family --  Kalahari Resort CEO Todd Nelson on his brilliant business model.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills here in Wisconsin.  We're at the 117th U.S. Open and  it is day two.</p><p> With school out for summer it is time to head for fun in the sun.  Kalahari  Resorts featuring three locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and right here in  Wisconsin combine a family-friendly vacation atmosphere with a state-of- the-art convention center space.  The company is now investing $65 million  to double the size of their convention space proving that a business model  that combines a waterslide park with massive convention center space is  quite the attraction.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about it is the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson.  Todd -- good to see.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> TODD NELSON, KALAHARI RESORT:  Well, thank you for having me.  It's a  pleasure to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting but usually people go on a business  trip and they don't bring their family but you are offering them to do  both.  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh yes.  And it works marvelously.  People find that their  attendance actually goes up when they have it a resort like ours.  And so  it's just a proven business.</p><p> We're doubling the size of our convention facility in Dells because our  groups have grown so large that they are outgrowing us, which is a  wonderful problem.  So we are doubling the size of that.  And we're  doubling the size of the one in the Pocono Mountains.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How is business right now?  </p><p> NELSON:  Business is outstanding.  And people love what we do.  You go and  you have fun and you play and it is -- it's basically Vegas hotel without a  casino but an indoor water park and an indoor theme park.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is so cool.</p><p> CORTES:  You know, Todd, I will tell you for all, I am a customer.  My kids  absolutely love your theme park -- the one in Wisconsin Dells.  What are  the hindrances to growth?  I mean your company is obviously doing well.  It  sounds like you're very optimistic on business.  But what are the obstacles  and particularly in terms of public policy type of scenario?  What could be  better from your perspective to grow Kalahari?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, we're in major growth mode right now.  I guess my biggest  problem is that I have more ideas and more sites than I have money.</p><p> CORTES:  Ok. </p><p> NELSON:  So we have three in the works right now.  Our next one is going to  be in Round Rock, Texas.  We have a site we're looking at in Massachusetts  and in Virginia.  And we're a privately held company.  It's my wife and I  and our five kids and so we're growing as quickly as we can.  But, you  know, just to get the money to do these -- they're very expensive.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well you talk about -- you say money.  What about the  availability of credit.  I'm assuming that you borrowed to build these  facilities.  What are the capital markets like right now for you?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, we have the most unusual model you have ever seen.  We build  small community banks so our Pennsylvania projects we have 65 small  community banks, most of those from Wisconsin, I think about seven from  Pennsylvania, our tiny little hometown back in Wisconsin Dells and this big  consortium of banks.  And it is relatively easy.  They require us to put a  lot of money down so what we do is we save and we build and then save again  and build again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because that's a segment of the market that,  you know, lawmakers have been saying they are not lending enough to small  banks and they're trying to loosen things up so it probably becomes even  better an environment for you.  </p><p> NELSON:  It's a wonderful environment and especially because they're small  community banks so they don't have all of the red tape that some of the  larger banks do.  You can pick up the phone and call the president of the  bank they take your call and they're happy to do business with you.  It is  a wonderful model.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> What do people want now when they're traveling?  I mean I know technology  has really added lots of different choices but what do people, families  whether it's on the convention side of things or the waterslide side of  things -- what are they looking for that is different?  </p><p> NELSON:  They're looking to be entertained for the entire time they're with  us.  Our average stay is only 1.9 days so they're there for 40 hours.  And  so we need to keep them busy the entire time.  So we are building indoor  theme parks with ferris wheels, ropes course, miniature golf, go karts,  really food and beverage options -- that is very, very important.</p><p> We're just getting into the virtual reality right now at all three of our  locations -- that is been very popular.  So just, they want to be  constantly kept busy and moving.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Virtual reality.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to know how you're innovating in terms of the actual  slides and the water features that you put in these parks.  I'm a water  park junkie and have been since I was little and I still go.  And so I want  to know, like how are you innovating?   Or is it just kind of an expansion  of what we have been seeing the last 20 years or so?  </p><p> NELSON:  It's really whatever we can dream up, they can build.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Really.</p><p> NELSON:  Yes.  And it's incredible -- I just got back two days ago.  My son  and I -- we went over to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kazakhstan (ph) and  Kuwait.  And we were looking at indoor theme parks.  They have the best  indoor theme parks in the world over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do they, really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  Oh absolutely.  Just tremendous stuff.  And we learned so much.   So we traveled.  Most of the waterslide companies are in Canada so we go  and visit them frequently and we talk about what we can do.  Uphill  waterslides are getting very popular.</p><p> It's a great business.  We get to dream and play and have fun.  And now we  just have -- we have nine grandchildren now, my wife and I do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How great.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  My goodness.</p><p> NELSON:  And so we have created the coolest little areas for one to five- year-olds.  They're just spectacular.  So water tables and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They want to go and hang out with Grandpa Todd and all his fun  toys.  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I tell the four other grandpas, I say, you know,  you don't have a chance.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, they don't.  You're right they don't have a chance to  compete.  </p><p> NELSON:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  So you learn some good stuff in Dubai and the  rest of them -- Dubai has a lot of indoor attractions, right.  </p><p> NELSON:  Yes, they do.  It's very hot over there.  It's 120 degrees when we  were over there.  And so we saw everything from a $2 million indoor theme  park to a billion-dollar indoor them park and it was life lessons really  well learned and so we'll take that all down to Texas and Pennsylvania and  around.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we look forward to that.  I know the Poconos properties  are real hot right now as well.  </p><p> NELSON:  It's smoking hot.  We love that East Coast market too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Smoking hot -- we'll take it.</p><p> Todd -- great to see you.</p><p> NELSON:  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the developments -- Todd  Nelson joining us.</p><p> Coming up re-chilling relations with Cuba.  President Trump is bringing  back harsher restrictions on Havana.  What it means for U.S. businesses in  the country.</p><p> Plus lots of investors saying cut me some slack after the upstart chat  company's $9 billion valuation -- why Amazon is reportedly interested in  acquiring the company before Wall Street can get its hands on it.  We'll  check it out.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from the U.S. Open at Erin Hills Golf Course in  Wisconsin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Friday, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, June 16th.  Here are  your top stories 7:30 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p> President Trump takes on Cuba.  The commander in chief set to unveil a new  policy toward the island nation.  Fox News is confirming that the action  will include strict enforcement of travel exemptions between the U.S. and  Cuba.  What it means for businesses investing in the country, coming up.</p><p> DuPont's merger with Dow Chemical has gotten approval, but with conditions.

Take a look at  Futures indicating a gain of about 20 points on the Dow Jones industrial  average.  About 10 points on the NASDAQ.  A firmer start to the markets  this morning.</p><p> In Europe, stocks are higher as well, across the board in fact.  Take a  look at the Eurozone indices and we see the FTSE 100 up two thirds of a  percent.  As is the CAC quarante in Paris and the DAX index in Germany, up  a quarter of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close in Asia.  As you see,  best performer was Japan, up just one half of one percent.  Hang Seng up a  quarter of a percent.</p><p> Another milestone for the final frontier.  A Russian ship set to dock with  the international space station later this hour.  The incredible images  coming up this morning.</p><p> First though our top story this half an hour.  President Trump is set to  unveil a new Cuba policy directive today in Miami.  Fox News can now  confirm it will include strict enforcement of travel exemptions between the  U.S. and Cuba.  Commerce between American companies and Cuban businesses  owned by its military and intelligence services would also reportedly be  prohibited.</p><p> The state department will also create a special taskforce to help expand  internet access for Cubans.  President Trump is reportedly expected to call  for the release of Cuban political prisoners.</p><p> Joining us right now to weigh on is the co-host of The Five, Juan Williams.   Juan, good to see you.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you make of these changes to the Obama era policy  really?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  The art of the deal, Maria.  The art of the deal.  I think that  what we're seeing from President Trump is an attempt to put Cuba back on  their heels and say, this is not going to be so easy to get the resumption  of some kind of relationship with the U.S.  And in order to accelerate that  relationship, you're going to have to make some accommodation, I think  especially in terms of press freedoms.  Treatments of people who are  political opponents of the Castro regime.</p><p> They want to see that before they're willing to allow the U.S., for  example, to travel that you spoke about.  The U.S. citizens to travel  easily to Cuba to infuse money into the Cuban economy.</p><p> CORTES:  Juan, Steve Cortes here.  To look at the political angle to this  during the campaign, of course, we all heard that Florida was going to be  the toss-up state.  It turns out it wasn't all that hard for Trump to win.   One of the reasons is he did exceedingly well among Cuban-American voters  in south Florida.  So, do you think this is important politically as a  promised kept to those Cuban voters who supported him?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Wow, that's a tough one.  I'll tell you why it's a tough one.   Yes.  He won in that Cuban community and again was a surprise to many  people given some of the comments he had about immigrants.  But not a  surprise among older Cubans who really have retain that anger at what  happened way back with the Castro, with Fidel Castro, in particular.</p><p> So the question is about younger Cubans who would really think the policy  that we had in place for 50 plus years did not lead to the erosion of the  communist state in their country.  It didn't improve conditions for people  living in Cuba.  Maybe this was a different step in terms of what the Obama  administration try to put in place.</p><p> But I think in terms of that older generation, you're exactly right.  I  think they would see this is a promise kept.  I'm not sure that President  Trump going to be faired to him, is going all the way back.  So we'll see  how this works out.</p><p> I do think it's about the deal making and about getting the new Castro,  Fidel's brother, Raul, to say I'm going to come to the table and try to  give you some of what you're seeking in terms of more democratic attitudes  and more economic freedoms that's especially important for American  businesses.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And in terms of American businesses, Juan, it's not that much of  a hardship that Trump does this.  We've seen a lot of the airlines, for  example, reducing and cutting the flights to keep up because the demand  from American tourist just has not materialized.  Not in the way that they  expected.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's right.  But I think that what you're hoping to see is in  fact that as American business goes in there, as they develop the resorts  potentially casinos and the like, I mean, that's what Cuba was famous for  in the day.  Dagen, you're still young.  But I think that's what they were  hoping for.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I have a collection of glasses and trinkets from those old  casinos before the revolution because you can buy them from people who fled  to Miami from Cuba.  So you can preach but I know what you're talking  about.  And I'm older than you think.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  Anyway, but I mean, when you start to  think about the potential there for tourism, I think it's a pretty much  very strong everything from the cigars to the rum and the like and just the  life.  So I think that's what American business was hoping for.  In fact,  at one point President Trump was hoping to develop some resorts, golf  courses in Cuba while he was in the private business.</p><p> So I think that's still there.  But you're right, the immediate kind of  tourism that the bump that the airlines was expecting has not materialized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about immigration in general.  The Trump  administration is scrapping another Obama era policy.  This one protecting  undocumented parents.  The administration says it's going to and the  deferred deportation fund of undocumented parents of children who are  American citizens or legal residents.  The decision does not affect another  Obama era program for children brought to the U.S. illegally.  What's your  reaction?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, that's a tough one.  I think again, you could put it under  the rubric of promises kept, in terms of cracking down on immigration.  But  wow, I think this hurts families, so I think you're going to get a lot of  kickback on this.  I don't think it helps him with the immigrant community  or with people who are looking for him to make a special exception for  those DACA children that you just described.  Children who were maybe  brought here as young people potentially against their will and who have  grown up here.  Have totally American identity.  When you start to break up  families, I do think it plays into the hand of the critics.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Juan, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching what  takes place this weekend.  Juan Williams joining us in New York.  Good to  see you, sir.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Enjoy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a mega merger scores antitrust -- a mega merger  scores antitrust approval, but there's a catch.  The condition is in place  for the multi- billion-dollar Dow-DuPont deal.</p><p> Plus, brewing up big bucks of Wisconsin.  I'll sit down with the president  of Leinenkugel Brewing to talk about the beer maker's explosive growth in  recent years.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin for the 117t U.S. Open.  Tee offs  beginning momentarily, actually.</p><p> We are watching the technology sector this morning.  Amazon reportedly  eying an acquisition.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange with details.  Nicole, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, we're looking  at Slack.  This is a chat room company and they'd been raising money and  raising interest among many companies including Amazon.  Will Amazon step  up and pay $9 billion for Slack?  This is a chat room type company.  You  could see Amazon stock 968.94 is up about a half of one percent.  It could  go for about $9 billion.</p><p> Recode also noting that some of the others are interested.  Microsoft,  Salesforce, Google.  And the analysts are saying that this -- if they were  to get Slack would really give Amazon a collaboration with the coworkers so  that they can chat among the coworkers around the globe and give them the  edge.  So we'll see whether or not that happens.</p><p> Then we're moving on to Dow and DuPont.  So that move is toward to win the  U.S. antitrust approval with some conditions.  That's the catch.  Because  there are some conditions here in order to make it go through.  The  companies have to agree now to sell, crop protection products as well as  some of the other assets.  And by doing that, that would then prevent hikes  or other things in the industry that people don't want to see.  And also  keep innovation alive.  So we're going to watch for that.</p><p> I will also note that while they got U.S. approval -- for the antitrust  approval, they still have to get some approval in Canada and Mexico but  have done so far in Europe and China.</p><p> And it just joins the whole farming industry.  There's Dow and DuPont,  buyer in Monsanto, ChemChina and Syngenta and part I should -- that maybe  planning a merger.  So things are in the works in this particular industry.   Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch that, Nicole.  Thanks so much.   Nicole Petallides on Wall Street.</p><p> Let's talk about this Dow-DuPont merger and we may or may not see.  They're  going to have to make some confessions, Steve.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  By the way too also, I think good news in general that I  think mergers are generally strong and heating up.  That's generally a good  sign for the stock market, good sign for the economy at large.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is going to be a behemoth company.  And we were waiting  for what the antitrust folks would say about it.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, you're right.  This is so big.  This is a unique merger in  that regard and there's so many policy implications and there's going to be  so much government oversight of it.  And I'm not smart enough lawyer to  know where that shakes out at the end and what they have to sell off or  what business they have to get out of.</p><p> But I think what's important as an investor is just to know that mergers  are strong in the M&amp;A business, Mergers and Acquisitions are strong.  I  think that's a good sign of optimism for the future.  If we get this tax  package done, which I believe we're going to, I think we are going to see  both the real economy and the stock market soar for the rest of 2017 and in  2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does this also speak to a friendlier administration and a  friendlier FTC in relation to approving these kinds of mergers?</p><p> CORTES:  Dagen, that's a great point.  Because they may not even try this,  right?  Let's say Hillary Clinton won and I say this is just a nonstarter.   Let's not even go down that road.  So I think we certainly have an  administration in the White House right now who is business friendly, who  knows that if we need employment -- if we're going to have employment,  really accelerate, not the kind of tepid employment gains that we've seen  lately.  We have to be pro-employer.</p><p> And part of that is the regulatory framework, the regulatory burden on  American business, both large and small has been onerous, far too heavy,  far too heavy-handed.  And I think once we unleash -- I really view the  American economy right now like a runner that's doing it's best to run, but  we're in a way to invest.  Once we think that way and vest off, I think  this economy is going to just soar.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about what we're seeing in markets.  I spoke to  really who I think is one of the smartest guys out there on Wall Street.   He just said, it's going to be hard for the market to get another leg up  significantly higher without the same stocks.  That is Facebook, Amazon,  Google, Alphabet the tech stocks that have been on fire.  And are we going  to see this market wait to see them stabilized?  Because they've been  really rolling over certainly.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  No, Maria.  Listen, I certainly hear that.  I think though  the roll over recently.  We need to put in context in a context of the  rally they had since the election that the roll over isn't that  significant.  Now, you bought these stocks couple weeks ago, you're having  a tough time.  If you bought it last summer, you're still doing fabulous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But maybe we're seeing a rotation.  It's a financials into  elsewhere.</p><p> CORTES:  In energy, I think.  Personally.  I think those two --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Give tech a break.</p><p> CORTES:  Those two places.  Exactly.  Tech has been -- and one of the  things that have worried me about the rally.  I'm constructive on the stock  market.  But one thing that has worried me is it's been a little too narrow  for my liking.  A few tech names have really dominated the rally.  I think  it would actually be healthier for the overall market and frankly for the  economy, if we saw a broader rally.  If we involve financials and energy.   I believe energy is going to get better from here.  So to me, it's not so  much market direction as it is.  Rotation, I think will be the game.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one positive sign at least this week is you have the NASDAQ  as poised to decline for the week.  Also the Russell 2000 and small  companies.  But the transports are up.  Of the five kind of major market  gauges including the Dow and the S&amp;P, that one is up more than any other.   It's almost up 0.9 percent.  That's not a huge gain.  But again, it's  always very often a sign of an economy that looks OK.  If people are  betting on the transport.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When the industrials and the transport move together for sure.</p><p> Let me ask you.  You mentioned tax reform.  We talk about this every  morning.  And we're waiting.  We know the markets are waiting.  Do you  still think they can get this done?  What do we have?  Twenty days, twenty- five days?  In terms of when these guys are in office.</p><p> CORTES:  I don't want to sound like Pollyanna.  Okay.  But I do believe  we're going to get enough.  Having said that, I will also say the congress  should not go on recess until this gets done.  And I firmly believe that  and I hope the people, I hope there's an uproar from the American people  telling congress.  They take all of August off.  All of it.</p><p> I mean, what Americans takes all August off?  I sure don't, you don't.  The  congress shouldn't.  Unless they things done first which is the two primary  ones are tax reform and health care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think healthcare is going to have an imminently.  And if they  get health care done imminently, they actually do have a shot to get tax  reform done.</p><p> CORTES:  I remain convinced that we're going to get it done.  When I talk  to my friends in the Trump campaign, many of whom are now in the White  House.  They tell me, a lot is going on behind the scenes.  While the  mainstream media is focused on ridiculous Russia allegations and while the  democrats are focused on made-up stories of collusion, there's a lot going  on between the White House and Hill republicans in terms of serious  negotiations to get this done.</p><p> And by the way, if we do, I think all the rest of that becomes just noise.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But there are a lot of republican senators who are already  talking about not getting on board with the republican health care bill  coming out of the senate.  Lisa Murkowski, Mike Lee, Rand Paul.  The list  continuous to grow.  And it's a very narrow margin of victory in the senate  for that.</p><p> CORTES:  No, it's not going to be easy.  And I'll say this too.  If we  don't get it done, I think we're going to be in a lot of trouble in 2018.   And we will deserve those problems in 2018.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why I think they're going to get it done.  Come hell  or high water.  We'll see.</p><p> Still ahead, bottling up success.  How Wisconsin's Leinenkugel Brewing  Company turned the craft beer trend into big bucks for the home state?   Back in a moment.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Erin Hills in the U.S. Open.  Nothing says  Wisconsin like beer and Leinenkugel has been brewing in the Badger State  for 150 years.  Joining us right now is Dick Leinenkugel, president of the  Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company.  Dick, that's quite a milestone.   Congratulations to you.</p><p> DICK LEINENKUGEL, PRESIDENT, JACOB LEINENKUGEL BREWING COMPANY:  Well,  we're really humbled and I'm humbled to be in the chair guiding our company  now in its sixth generation of 150 years of brewing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do that?  Do you look to change in terms of growth  or do you try to keep it as it was from the beginning?  How do you lead a  company that's 150 years old?  You want to keep some things, I guess the  way they are.  I know it always has been but you just want to grow  differently.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  I think you grow up in the business.  Being part of the  family.  Our great-great-grandfather started brewing beer in 1867 in  Chippewa Falls for the thirsty lumberjacks that were milling the way  playing lumber to build the great city of Chicago.</p><p> So it's now through five generations.  The government tried to put us out  of business in 1918 but we survived that by making soda pop.  Came out of  probation, the third generation, fourth generation.  My father led the  company for over 40 years.  My brother for 25 years and now I'm in the  chair and we have just a great team of employees in Chippewa Falls,  Wisconsin and the world's best brew master's.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What a proud history.  Terrific.</p><p> CORTES:  So 30 years ago, I guess the business was sold, is that correct?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  So my dad and his cousins have both decided to join up  with Miller Brewing Company at the time.  A well-respected Wisconsin  Brewer, 30 years ago.  So, yes.</p><p> CORTES:  Tell me though.  But it sounds like still a lot of autonomy.  I  mean, it sounds like Leinenkugel is still truly its own businesses within  this very large organization most of all.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  And I think that's really why we've been able to thrive is  that the family has guided the business.  But using the resources of Miller  Brewing Company, the MillerCoors now.  Part of the MillerCoors global  network.  So it's really something that we've been able to maintain that  autonomy, our own brewing in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.  Been able to grow  the business with their help.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Talk about beer innovations.  Again, I actually, off-camera,  tasted the summer shandy and I can say that it's 6:40 in the morning, It's  a delicious breakfast beer.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  It's absolutely fabulous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think 5:00 somewhere.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did 5:00 A.M.  I didn't drink one of the hot beers.  I didn't  have the whole thing.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  SO summer shandy is available on the course here at Erin  Hills.  And what a refreshing beer.  So it's beer mixed with lemonade.  And  we were the first to bring this down to the United States back in 2007.   And we've been growing the business ever since.  And now in five months, we  brew more summer shandy than all of our other beers combined.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds incredible with lemonade.  You're also celebrating  the anniversary with a special beer.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  We are.  So we collaborated with Hofbrau.  So think of this.   A German brewery with 400 years of brewing experience.  Our brewery with  150 years of brewing experience collaborated on a special German Marzen  style beer to celebrate our 150th anniversary.  So it's a fabulous beer.   It's just available now in six packs starting on draft.  And it's going to  be just a wonderful beer to celebrate our 150 years of brewing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  What are your plans in terms of further expansion?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Well, we're expanding our brewery in Milwaukee to add more  brewing capacity and more brewing capability and we certainly want to  continue to grow.  First and foremost, we're all about delighting our beer  drinkers and I think by delighting our beer drinkers, that's how we  continue to grow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Can you go through -- I mean, beer versus Ale.  When  you have more wheat in one.  Give us the different ales if you will in  terms of the beer category.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  So there's two kinds of beer.  And you're saying, well, what  do you mean?  There's 500, 1,000 different kinds of IPAs.  No.  There's  only two kinds of beer.  There's lagers and there are ales.  And it all has  to do about the yeast strain.  So lagers are coal fermented.  And for a  longer period of time, ales are used with a different fermentation and  they're a little bit more at a quicker period of time.  They're a little  bit more fruity and estuary where ales are -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And are they lighter?  Is an ale lighter?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Ale is no.  Not necessarily.  It all depends on the style  within the lager or the ales.  But there's really only two kinds of beer.   So think of it that way.  And it all has to do with the yeast strain.  But  there's a lot of innovation in the beer market today.  We do mostly lager- style beers which are aged, cold-stored for a little bit smoother flavor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Thank you for that.  Real quick on Trump's policies.   Do you feel like tax reform is going to make a big difference in terms of  growth strategy?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  You know that we're a heavily taxed industry right now and  have been for many years.  But I think that the best thing that I can  continue to do is to brew great beer that are beer drinkers are going to  choose.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dick, great to have you on the show today.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dick Leinenkugel joining us here.</p><p> Breaking news.  President Trump just tweeting, \"After seven months of  investigations and committee hearings about my \"collusion with the  Russians.\"  Nobody has been able to show any proof.\"  We will have more on  that coming up.

Thank you so much for joining us  here in Erin Hills in Wisconsin, it is Friday, June 16th.  Your top stories  right now, 8:00 am on the East Coast.  With the breaking news this morning,  the leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The associated press reporting that  Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an air strike in  Syria about a month ago.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot confirm  this news.</p><p> We are waiting on more confirmation.  We are looking at what it means for  the war on terrorism straight ahead.  A show of unity at the congressional  baseball game last night, both teams coming together for a prayer for their  colleague Congressman Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.  And  President Trump praised lawmakers in a video message right before the game.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In Washington, we have our  disagreements.  But we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we  love.  And the people who call it home.  That's the source of unity and  more than ever we must embrace it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the unity we short-lived unfortunately House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi already back at it attacking Republicans this morning,  blaming Republicans for the (INAUDIBLE) in politics.  What she said coming  up.  President Trump on defensive this morning.  He just tweeted on the  Russia investigation saying this, quote, After 7 months of investigations  and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\" nobody has been  able to show any proof.  Sad!  We'll have more on that coming up as  president tweets about Russia.  And health care battle rages on Capitol  Hill.  Why conservatives are growing concerned about the state of the  senate's bill.</p><p> Billions in liabilities on faulty airbags could bring down Takata.  The  company behind the biggest auto recall in U.S. history may be preparing for  bankruptcy now.  The details next.  And the drama over Bernie Madoff not  going away.  New scrutiny this morning over the compensation fund for his  victims and why it hasn't been paid out yet.  Futures are indicating a gain  at the opening of trading this morning.  Take a look at markets futures  indicating gain of about 15 points on the Dow, five points on NASDAQ, the  market is off from the best levels of the morning right now.</p><p> In Europe, stocks are still higher.  Take a look at the Eurozone indices  here.  And you see the FT 100 and the CAC quarante up about two-thirds of  one percent and the DAX Index in German up a quarter of a percent.  Markets  in Asia overnight finished mixed.  As you'll see here best performer was  Japan of 1/2 of one percent.  And it is day two of U.S. Open, it is getting  under way.  Will Rickie Fowler follow his day one success?  We've got a  recap of yesterday's action, everything you need to know as golfer's tee up  right now, all of those stories coming up this morning and joining me to  talk all about it Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, BGC partner senior  strategist, and Fox News contributor, Steve Cortes.  Great day.  Great to  be here.  </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's so gorgeous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love the white Wisconsin flavor that you get out here.  Dick  Leinenkugel talking about you can be drinking summer (INAUDIBLE) as you  watch all this fantastic (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p> CORTES:  The first U.S. Open ever in Wisconsin.  I would think the first of  many given the hospitality so far.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  We got a big show ahead.  We've got this  breaking news that we're following, that the head of ISIS has been killed.   Joining the conversation, Texas Congressman, Brian Babin is with us, the  CEO of Harley-Davidson is here, Matt Levatich, PGA Tour Superstore  President, and CEO, Dick Sullivan is here, and the host of Varney and Co.,  Stuart Varney also will weigh in.  Big hour ahead you don't want to miss a  moment of it.</p><p> First off, breaking news President Trump just tweeted this, and he is  talking about the Russia probe this morning, \"After seven months of  investigations and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\"  nobody has been able to show any proof.  Sad!\"  says the president.  Adam  Shapiro was live at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam,  good morning to you.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS:  And good morning to you, Maria.  The  administration points out as well, that it was James Comey who told the  president three times, that he was not a part of the investigation  regarding Russia and then just late last night, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy  attorney general put out a statement, an official DOJ statement saying that  Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories  attributed to anonymous officials.</p><p> So the administration is standing up for the president and fighting back on  some of these stories but the other news that is gaining attention here at  the White House, this morning, has to do with what you were reporting about  Russia's claim that they killed that ISIS leader and his name Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, they say was killed on May 28 during a Russian attack on a  meeting of ISIS leaders in Raqqa, Syria.  Now, they say that this took  place during the meeting and that they also killed 30 mid-level militant  leaders and about 300 fighters, the U.S. military cannot confirm that al- Baghdadi was actually killed and there have been reports over years that he  was killed but if it is true, official say this would be a big blow to ISIS  which is on the run in both Iraq and Syria.</p><p> The other headlines which are grabbing attention at the White House have to  do with vote in the Senate yesterday, in which the senate voted 97 to two  to approve new sanctions against Russia.  Very simply these sanctions would  be against Russia's mining and minerals sector as well as energy sector.   It would have consequences for countries in Europe like Germany because it  would go after companies which invest in Russian organizations.</p><p> Now, there was a statement by Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary who  said and this is a quote, \"The administration is committed to existing  sanctions against Russia and will keep them in place until Moscow fully  honors its commitment to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.\"  \"We believe the  existing executive branch sanctions regime is the best tool for compelling  Russia to fulfill its commitments.\"  The Senate enacted these sanctions,  although, they're not official just yet as retribution for Russia's  interferences with the 2016 elections and of course its annexation of  Crimea.  This still needs to be voted upon in the House and then get  President Trump's signature.  It's a long road ahead if these sanctions are  to become law.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam, we'll be watching that.  Thank you so much.   Adam Shapiro with the latest there, he's at the White House.  Meanwhile, a  show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  coming together for a prayer for their colleague.  Congressman Steve  Scalise ahead of the first pitch last night.  Here is what Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi had to say on her weekly news conference yesterday just before  the baseball game.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  When the president says  \"I can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care\", when you have  somebody say \"beat them up and I'll pay their legal fees\", when you have  all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so  sanctimonious is something that I really am almost sad that I had to go  down this path with you because I don't think it's appropriate for us to  have the fullest discussion of it.  It will be for another day.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, there goes the unity that was short lived.  Joining us  right now is Texas Republican Congressman, Brian Babin.  Congressman, your  reaction to Nancy Pelosi's comments there.</p><p> REP. BRIAN BABIN, (R) TEXAS:  I am not surprised, Maria, not surprised  whatsoever.  I listened to her 20-minute-long speech on the floor the other  day and I could only hope that that was sincere but when you look at the --  for instance to some of her commencement speeches to graduating college  seniors over the past few months has been divide, divide, divide, you know,  and I'm not just blaming her, it's the left in general.  They lost the  election.</p><p> They're demonizing us in our policies, they can demonize our policies but  don't demonize us and that's kind of what ginned up this whole thing and  again, the oil needs to be poured on the waters but it's got to be from  both sides, and as we saw, calling us sanctimonious after one of our  leaders was shot on a baseball field for a charity game, it is pretty low.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But what are you going to do about it though?  I mean, you guys  have to get it an agenda executed.  I mean, let's talk health care reform  for a second, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that some Republicans  are also pushing back in terms of getting a health care reform done so it's  not just the division between the Republicans and the Democrats but  division between the Republicans, are you concerned over the senate's new  bill to replace Obamacare?  We're all wondering where it is, what it says.   Critics are saying that the plan doesn't do enough to reduce health care  premiums and you need democratic support and you're not getting it because  of this division.</p><p> BABIN:  Well we're never going to get Democratic support on this, Maria,  there's just no way.  They're determined to, you know -- to stick with a --  with a ship that sinking Obamacare.  But yes, I am concerned that we may  get a bill but it's going to take a lot of rehashing.  We will have to go  to conference on this thing.  We've got to get these premiums down, we've  got to do this thing right, you -- I was a no initially on the original  proposal in the house, I did get some great concessions to me from --  personally from the president, a personal phone call which got me to a yes  and we held out and we got a bill, we got one through, and now, it's up to  the Senate.</p><p> I'm talking to some of my Texas Senate colleagues and they're confident we  are going to get a bill out, what's going to be in it, I have no clue but  we better get it right and we better get it -- get these premiums down, and  we absolutely have to replace this spiraling downward Obamacare plan which  is not going to be with us a whole lot longer.</p><p> CORTES:  Congressman, Steve Cortes here, you know, over the -- until Labor  Day, so, you know, roughly 10 weeks or so, I think the Congress is only  going to be working 22 days or so, something like that, most Americans are  working a hack of lot more than that.  If you don't get tax reform done if  you don't get tax cuts done should the Congress stay in session and not  take its August recess?</p><p> BABIN:  I am in favor of that a one hundred percent.  If we can be useful  up here, if we can vote on some things that absolutely need to be done,  again, the Trump and the Republican conservative agenda has to be delivered  to the American people, that is why we were elected, that's why we won the  presidency --</p><p> CORTES:  And that, Congressman --</p><p> BABIN:  -- and if we don't get it done I think there's going to be a hell  to pay in the 2018 of the midterm elections, so we've got to get this done,  we need tax reform, regulatory reform and we've got to get past health care  reform and repeal and replace Obamacare first.  Absolutely.  You are right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, how is -- it's Dagen McDowell, how is it that some  of your colleagues over on the Senate side are making -- seeming to make  the same mistake that the Democrats did in terms of their crafting this  bill behind closed doors and a lot of fellow Republicans senators have not  seen it and they don't know what's in it and you guys over in the house  certainly don't at this point.</p><p> BABIN:  We have no clue.  As I said a while ago I don't know what if we're  going to wind up saying but -- I mean, I am apprehensive about that, Dagen.   I think it needs to be an open process, I think had it been a more open  process in the house it wouldn't have been a two month dragged out deal the  way it was.  And so I wish that they would look and profit from the  mistakes that we made over in the house, but we did it and we got our job  done, it wasn't a perfect bill.</p><p> I think it was absolutely more conservative at the time that I got to a yes  rather than later as we waited for several weeks, even a month or two.  It  became a less conservative bill in my opinion but nevertheless, I voted for  it.  We -- that was the promise we made for the American people to repeal  this terrible bill, which is destroying the health care industry in our  country.  And as a -- as a -- as a --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How can you teach --</p><p> BABIN:  As a health care provider myself I can tell you that Obamacare was  absolutely destroying the doctor-patient relationship.  And our bill would  replace that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Congressman, you keep saying, \"We've got to get  this done, we've got to get this done,\" but realistically speaking, do you  see that path?  I mean, you've got to get health care done really quickly,  so I assume you'll accept whatever the Senate comes up with, but do you  think you can get health care on a very short term timeline and then come  back from the summer and do tax reform, is that what you're saying?  I  mean, what is the path?  Because as Steve just said you've got 22 days.</p><p> BABIN:  You're exactly right, Maria and, you know, I can't -- I can't say  or even predict what we are going to get and I can't tell you that I'm  going to support whatever comes out of the Senate.  We're going to have to  make sure that it is something that'll put the average Americans back in  the saddle in controlling their own health care policies and get these  premiums deductibles down so that we will -- we will go back to conference  on -- depending on what they finally wind up passing.</p><p> But I will tell you this, if the Senate would dispense with this 60-vote  rule, the filibuster rule we would get a whale of a lot of our agenda  accomplished but being dependent on getting eight Democrats to vote with us  on every issue that comes right to the Senate, well, the thing about it  that gives a veto power to Nancy Pelosi and to Chuck Schumer and it really  shouldn't happen.  We won't have Judge Gorsuch right now had we not done  so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman, good to have you on the program.   We'll be watching.  Thank you so much.</p><p> BABIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Brian Babin.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Shares of Takata has been suspended in Tokyo.   Ahead of expected bankruptcy filing.  Lauren Simonetti with the details in  New York.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FIELD PRODUCER:  Certainly a story  that we're watching, Maria.  Takata facing billions of dollars in  liabilities after its defective airbags led to the biggest safety recall in  automotive history linked to at least a dozen debts and over one hundred  injuries worldwide.  Takata had said to be in talks about a potential deal  with a key -- with key safety systems that the U.S. auto parts maker.   Well, there's growing criticism in how the Bernie Madoff compensation fund  is being handled.</p><p> The Justice Department settlement fund has four billion dollars year marked  for the victims but no one has been paid a cent since the fund was created  four years ago.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a  congressional panel this week he will look into why it has taken so long  for money to reach thousands of investors who took losses in Madoff's Ponzi  scheme.  Well, guess this, Illinois will no longer sell tickets for Mega  Millions or Powerball after June 30th if there is no state budget.</p><p>Illinois lawmakers have been unable to pass the budget for more than two  years now.  The governor has called a special session of legislature to  come up with a budget deal but a lot of spokesperson said, Powerball would  be suspended after the June 28th drawing and Mega Millions after the June  30th drawing if a budget deal is not reached.  And this I'm not making up,  many Americans think we live in a Willy Wonka world survey a real survey  commissioned by the National Dairy Council, seven percent of us believe  chocolate milk comes from chocolate colored cows.</p><p> That appears like a small number but it amounts to 16 or 17 million  citizens.  Forty-eight percent of adults surveyed admitted to not being  sure of where chocolate milk comes from.  The refrigerator, Maria comes  from the refrigerator.  I mean, really?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  See you later.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go figure.  Thanks, Lauren.  Coming up, when it comes to made  in America, Harley-Davidson is at the front of the pack.  We'll talk to the  CEO of the motorcycle giant about how they're embracing President Trump's  American made initiatives and then the biggest names in golf teeing off at  the U.S. Open this morning.  Who is at top of the standings after an  exciting start for the tournament, we'll bring it to you next live from  Erin Hills.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills for the 117th U.S. Open this morning here in  Wisconsin.  The second round of the U.S. Open tees off in minutes.  Jared  Max joining is joining us now for a look at what happened yesterday.   Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  U.S. Open  traditionally humbling to golf scorers even for the best players in the  world but yesterday 29 players shot under par, in fact, 17 recorded scores  of 3 under or better.  Nobody was better than 28-year-old Californian  Rickie Fowler.  Fowler has never won a major tournament but he has a one- shot lead entering today's second round.  He hit the string of three  straight birdies yesterday, seven birdies, and all no bogeys finished 7  under and that's tied for lowest score in relation to par ever in the first  round at the U.S. Open.</p><p> Rough day for defending champion, Dustin Johnson, the emphasis on rough,  fescue shot.  A 75, 3 over tied for 102nd.  Jordan Spieth didn't have  banner first round either, he struggled on the greens.  Finished at 1 over  and Jason Day, tough day as well.  Close encounter with the fescue at Erin  Hills.  He tripled bogeyed, the fourth hole and finished at 7 over par.  So  let's take a look at how the leaderboard shapes up now as round two just  getting under way.</p><p> Rickie Fowler your leader by one over Paul Casey, and American Xander  Schauffele, also Jordan Spieth, you see that plus one Dustin Johnson at 3  over and Rory McIlroy plus 6, not so easy to hit those fair waze, is it,  Rory?  Time for baseball highlights and not home runs images but rather  images of stellar defense yesterday who made a more spectacular catch  Thursday.  Trevor Story of the Colorado Rockies or Didi Gregorius of the  New York Yankees.</p><p> Let's start with Trevor Story.  Colorado was up, 3-1 on San Francisco,  Denard Span pops it up, watch Trevor Story here, beautiful catch, diving to  make the grab.  Trevor Story comes up with the help of Rockies win the game  10-9.  They lead the NL West by one game.  Nice grab.  Meanwhile, the New  York Yankees' Didi Gregorius last night with an amazing catch for Didi  Gregorius looked somewhat like Willie Mays.  I mean, catch better won goes  to Willie Mays, it goes to Didi Gregorious.</p><p> It looks like we don't have that.  And the Golden State following their  second NBA Championship the last three seasons, the Warriors parted ways  parting with their fans yesterday during a parade and rally in downtown  Oakland.  Draymond Green of the Warriors had fun of the Cavaliers' expense  that, you know, the Cavaliers play at Quicken Loans Arena.  They call it  The Q, well, they got to see their finals opponent take a shot at how short  the series was.  Draymond Green wore a T-shirt with a big Q, only said  quickie since the Warriors won a quickie in five games.  Green also took a  shot at LeBron James because LeBron, remember, ditched Cleveland for Miami,  well, and what about super teams.  Listen to what he said yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DRAYMOND GREEN, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS:  I don't want to talk about super  teams this, super team that.  I never played on a super team, you started  the super team, bro.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  And look at that, Maria.  A shot at LeBron James.  Remember, he left  Cleveland, was criticized because he went to Miami and said, \"Hey, I can't  win a championship without these superstars and now, I got superstars and  now, they're criticizing the Warriors for doing the same thing.  Maria, I  do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They have it scripted.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, incredible.  You know what, Jared, great stuff.  We're  actually all focused right now on what we have on set, we have the U.S.  Open Championship trophy right here and it's absolutely spectacular.  I  mean, this is -- Dagen, let's talk about it.  It's all sterling silver?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it's pure sterling silver.  It weighs eight and a half  pounds.  This trophy dates back to 1947.  The original trophy was lost in a  clubhouse fire the year prior to that, so in '46, the trophy was lost in a  fire, so this one goes back to 1947, and you look at the names and just  look at the names that are engraved on the side of it, 65 Gary Player.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of the names are engraved.  It's absolutely -- and the back  here --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Billy Casper, '67, Jack Nicklaus.  If you look at the top five  golfers who've won the most U.S. Opens, Nicklaus is in the top five.  I  think that he is third.  They are no -- Tiger Woods I believe is fifth but  there are no golfers currently on the tour who ranked among golfers who won  the most U.S. Opens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, they don't keep this forever, right?  What's the -- what's  the scoop?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Keep it for a year.  They get to keep it for a year.  They do  get -- they do get a keepsake that they don't have to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CORTES:  They do get also one interesting trivia so it wouldn't be this one  but the previous one in 1898, I forget the guy's name but whoever won it  was apparently a very heavy drinker, they were worry that he would hack it  for drinking money, had to put it -- he had a cool story, he had to put on  a deposit to keep it for the year --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p> CORTES:  -- but they keep -- and also interesting, when you look at the  names on here, I don't know, the viewers probably can't see it but one  thing you certainly notice is a very few repeats, only two people have ever  won twice in a row and after DJ started yesterday it seems like probably  not going to happen again this year.  We're going to have a new winner, it  looks like.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and just think the way it's engraved, it's so beautiful.   I don't even want to touch it, it's so gorgeous.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, they told me I wasn't allowed to touch it --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, then I won't try to --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just -- because I break things, so I  have to keep my -- it has a restraining order against me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely beautiful.  Sterling silver, the trophy right  here and somebody's going to be walking home with that on this tournament  and keeping it a for a year.  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting,  here is what he say in this morning, \"The Fake News Media hates when I use  what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media.  Over 100 million  people I can go around them.\"  He is fired up this morning, Steve Cortes.</p><p> CORTES:  You know, listen, make tweeting great again.  It was -- I'm going  to defend the president on this.  I love that he tweets and even a lot of  people who like him and who support him say, \"Gosh, I wish he'd hold back  on the Twitter,\" I think this is so important that number one, he can  connect directly with the American people, there's no mediators anymore,  but I think the secondly, most of the mainstream media is so utterly  antagonistic toward the president and I frankly don't even think that's  really very debatable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CORTES:  And the amount of fake news that's put out about him, one just  recent example, Washington Post saying that Comey asked for more money and  then he was -- for the Russian investigation and that's why he was fired.   Completely false --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p> CORTES:  -- utterly, utterly false --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will --</p><p> CORTES:  -- so the president has to go directly to the people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's what he's doing.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, Kroger getting clobbered.  The grocery store giant shares of  plummeting this morning after putting lower profits.  How the company plans  to turn that around.  Then going hot wild, the CEO of Harley-Davidson is  with us live to talk about the company's deep Wisconsin roots and talk  about President Trump's impact on business since taking office.

And from clicks  to bricks details on Amazon new patent that could stop in store customers  from comparing the company prices online.  If you're using their Wi-Fi  they're in control. </p><p> Futures showing the markets will open this way we are well off of the highs  of the morning we're seeing some selling under way this morning Dow  industrials expected to be up but just about eight points now that's well  off the highs, of earlier, something is happening, where this market is  turning as we speak as you see there.  In Europe, stocks are higher across  the board although, there too were off of the highs as you see here, F.T- 100, CAC Quarante up two-thirds of one percent, DAX Index up just a quarter  of a percent.  And in Asia overnight markets finished mixed take a look at  the markets there, the best performer is Japan up one-half of one percent.</p><p> An action-packed day the first day of the U.S. Open yesterday, Rickie  Fowler at top of the leader. </p><p> We will show you how you can have your dad look like the pros this father's  day.  We've got all the gifts you want to know about.  We are live here in  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin, for the 117th U.S. Open, of course, one  of the staples of the state is Harley-Davidson the legendary motorcycle  brand was founded in Milwaukee Wisconsin back in 1903, I am sporting a hot  Harley jacket right now.  A wardrobe change as we welcome the CEO of  Harley- Davidson, Matthew Levatich joining us here, Matt great to see you  again.</p><p> MATTHEW LEVATICH, HARLEY-DAVIDSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Nice to see  you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, thank you very much.  So  you've been committed to creating jobs in America your name comes up a lot  with President Trump, characterize the jobs market for us what you're  seeing in terms of the broader economy. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well you know as you mentioned we've been here from the very  beginning 1903, our engine plant is still in Milwaukee and Milwaukee's got  a long and proud history of a lot of not only manufacturing with technology  and development, and so the skilled trades element of what we see in a  workforce is very important.  So far we're having great success with the  employment that we need, the broader economy I think for the company and  for, you know, the United States, for us, is a lot about our opportunities  to grow internationally.  So trade is very important and we're paying a lot  of attention to the trade policies and the trade opportunities that we have  particularly in Asia, which is the world largest motorcycle market are in  Asia, our biggest growth potential, is in Asia and so the trade barriers  trade tariffs are obviously top of mind as we look to pursue those goals. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk about that because when President Trump speaks  about trade he's come up with this idea of a reciprocal tax and I think  it's partly because of your story, because when you sell motorcycles in  India they charge you what a 100 percent or 90 percent?</p><p> LEVATICH:  One hundred percent tariff on a straight import. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A 100 percent tariff to India and you're charge to 90 percent  tariff in China.</p><p> LEVATICH:  Yes, and throughout that region actually the tariffs in the  entire tax structure add a significant amount of burden to the product  before it gets to retail, and that limits our ability to access and reach  those customers we have a lot of passion for Harley in the region, again  their big motorcycle markets their growing and we see opportunity but those  tax and trade barriers are significant for us, as a limitation to that  growth. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This has been one of the most important examples, that  President Trump has discussed your story, the fact that you're selling  motorcycles overseas and they're giving you this huge tariff and were not  putting those kinds of tariffs on their products when they're coming here.   So do you favor something like that, I mean how do you alleviate these 100  percent tariffs if China and India are not going to change their - </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well, you know, the whole trade environment can't be taken in  isolated cases and so it's a very complex issue clearly we are heavily  invested U.S. manufacturer we are exporting our products around the world  90 countries so a direct offset of imported motorcycles is not something  that's easily, sort of, simple, sort of, contained a solution, and you  know, in something like TPP was in negotiation for almost a decade before  it was unfortunately turned down, right?  That would have helped us a lot  we're optimistic the administration understands the issues that we face and  our working on our behalf of as well as on behalf of many here American  companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean isn't it interesting that the biggest markets for you  are in Asia, and this is where they are actually charging they know that  this is a big market for you and they are going to make sure you may up for  it. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well, that's I guess one interpretation, it is what it is and  we're working every angle that we can, to open those markets, because the  customers are there, they are interested as those economies as disposable  income-leisure time expands, it's a right market for Harley-Davidson our  competitors are there oftentimes without the burdens that we have.  And we  need to find ways to access those markets. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well you are obviously an iconic brand, got a loyal following  all around the world.  Tell us about what you're seeing a lot of people  talking about the retail environment being under pressure we saw that from  retail sales we may have seen that even from your earnings I don't know if  that's what you saw.</p><p> LEVATICH:  You know, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market many  people are participating in the economy but they're participating in ways  that are I think easily kind of turned on and turned off their watching to  see sustained and significant momentum in the economy job security income  security those types of things.  So that sort of tempted in this, I think  affects companies like Harley, you know, we're selling a product that is an  aspiration product it's some people dream to have and if they don't have  that kind of security they might hold off and wait.  And I think that's,  that's an aspect of the economy that's still with us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you attract newer generations?</p><p> LEVATICH:  That's very important to us we are fundamentally about riding,  you know, when you look around the beautiful country sided here around Erin  Hills this is where the company was founded this is where I like to come  and ride beautiful rolling hills and scenic roads.  I think our founders  were doing the same thing at the very beginning, it is for us all about  riding, and creating and recreating the passion for motorcycling is really  core to our strategy for the next decade.  So it's not simple thing to do  but just reminding ourselves that we are in the business of riding and to  make sure that we have the full attention of not just we build motorcycles  but we build riders, because we have to invest in our sport and remind  people how awesome it is to be out riding a motorcycle. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did you ride your bike here today?</p><p> LEVATICH:  I did not because they would not let me into Erin Hills on a  motorcycle oddly enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p> LEVATICH:  You know this golf community I don't know what they're thinking. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly but you sell a lot of other products other than bikes  this jacket for example. </p><p> LEVATICH:  This jacket.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is gorgeous your jacket, tell us about the pricing for the  bikes today and what is the range? </p><p> LEVATICH:  We have we cover a range jackets for a lot broader that most  people think you can get into Harley for in this high 6,000, 7,000's, and  then of course we produce motorcycles that are for the aspirational owner  that are kind in the high 30s and obviously there are lot of differences  across that range but we cover that whole price spectrum with Harley- Davidson motorcycles and part of what we need to do is do a better job  informing people that there's something for everybody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially when you something wants custom made you do that. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Yes, we have custom vehicle operations heavily accessorized and  bigger engines, and you know the real ultimate product for the ultimate  passionate customer.  But again we've got a lot of stuff in between, a real  and their all great there are all high impact, really cool looking, for  young adults for women for whomever. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well I -- this is quite cool looking if I say so myself. </p><p> LEVATICH:  You look - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Matt great to have you on the show today.</p><p> LEVATICH:  Thanks for appreciating it.  Nice to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Matthew Levatich is the CEO of Harley- Davidson, we'll take a short break when we come back a wild start to the  U.S. Open Stuart Varney gives us a take on the tournament so far.  And then  Amazon patents hypocrisy, why the company wants to stop customers from  comparing prices with competitors after revolutionizing the way we prize,  back in a minute</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back we are coming to you live today from the beautiful  Erin Hills a golf course for 117th U.S. Open this morning, here in  Wisconsin.  Tee-off has begun and we are watching the day begin, welcome  back we are looking at markets this morning, a turning negative here, as  you saw earlier we were looking at a firmer beginning, and that has pretty  much evaporated.  The Dow Industrials now showing a gain at just two  points, Nasdaq is now negative, that's down two points and the S&amp;P 500,  just holding in positive territory by a quarter of a point, so markets have  turned decidedly mixed at this point.  </p><p> The couple of names were watching this morning, Kroger definitely one to  watch in terms of volume and movement the stock of the grocery giant fell  nearly 20 percent yesterday after company cut its full year for earnings  forecast.  Kroger is blaming the move on higher product cost, Kroger shares  right now as you see continuing that slide, down another two percent this  morning.</p><p> We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent that can  stop in store shopper from comparing prices on their phones.  So when  you're shopping around this technology will allow the store to see what a  shopper is searching for connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can intake  action like an e-mail or a coupon to suggest the comparable item or it can  even block access to the competitive content. </p><p> so if you are looking for a cheaper price on something, away from Amazon  might not be able to find it while in Amazon store.  Pretty incredible move  from Amazon.  Stock is up today.  Meanwhile, round two will kick off in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open.</p><p> Joining me right now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney who is a  regular watcher of golf.  Stu, good morning to you. </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  Maria, point  of correction not kickoff in golf, you tee-off.  You blast off, that is you  tee-off.  I want it if possible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is kicking off, Stu.  I have been saying that it is tee- off time all morning, but, of course, you have not been watching all  morning. </p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, I have glued. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You really wish you were here. </p><p> VARNEY:  I do, I do, I do.  I want you to make a special point of going  over to Rickie Fowler, congratulating him on being seven under, I think  latest on the board.  I want you to tell him that we miss his fashion  sense.  He used to appear in most outrageous colors, outfits, really stood  out, then all of a sudden he grew up.  I don't know what happened, he  changed and now he's a normal looking golf type guy.  So just have a quick  word with him, Maria, and straighten him out when you get the chance. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stu, aren't there rules that you are not supposed to wear stuff  like that on the golf course?  I mean, I know in tennis you really have to  stick to the wardrobe rules. </p><p> VARNEY:  Now you are talking about Wimbledon.  It remains white shirt,  white shorts whatever.  I think everybody else is - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are no kinds of rules in golf? VARNEY:  I don't think so.  You can you can't have a Coca-Cola shirt.  You  can't do that at Masters.  I don't know about at U.S. Open.  If Rickie  Fowler wants to arrive in his pantaloons or whatever you want to call them,  that's the one.  If you wanted to arrive looking like that, I'd be cheering  him on. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  You know Stu, I have taken golf lessons just so  you know.  I took lessons with best of the best.  I have a shot to show  you, Stuart.  I don't want to get you jealous or anything but Hank Haney  gave me golf tips.  Hank Haney of course, Tiger Woods coach.  He was  showing me how to putt.  Quite exciting. </p><p> VARNEY:  So Maria, without too far on the - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm not actually a neophyte in golf as you say.</p><p> VARNEY:  I am not done yet, Maria.  Hold on.  Don't cut my segment short  here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm not good.  I never said I was good, Stuart.  OK?  I just --  I got lessons and then never played again. </p><p> VARNEY:  I will let you into a secret of mine.  I have only played once and  played nine holes only at the South Hampton Princess in Bermuda.  You know  what my score was for nine holes?  118.  So I quit playing, I caddied and I  watched all the time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good move.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.  I think so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stuart, happy father's day my friend. </p><p> VARNEY:  Thank you very much indeed, Maria.  And the same to all of you and  your staff right there. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will see you 10 minutes on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\".  Thank you,  Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. right after  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

But first, a message from a pro at the U.S.  Open. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JORDAN SPEITH, U.S. OPEN WINNER:  Hey, Dad.  I just wanted to drop a note  saying that you mean the world to me.  You are my biggest role model,  somebody I look up to for everything especially off the course.  I don't  look up to you much on the course but I owe a lot to you.  You have been a  tremendous father to me, my brother, and my sister, and a tremendous  husband to mom.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SPEITH:  I feel very lucky that I have the dad.  He is a tremendous role  model.</p><p> JASON DAY, GOLFER:  Enjoy the moment with your loved ones.  Enjoy the  moment with your kids.

It would it be nice. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure would be.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills this  morning in Wisconsin.  We are at the 117th U.S. Open, and you just heard  top tour golfer share why Father's Day this Sunday is so important to them.   The holiday rakes major bucks for retailers.

This is a huge week for  us.  We got a lot of great gifts, this weekend will be -- this week will  break a record for our company.  This will be the biggest week as I said,  of the year. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In fact, you've got great products right here with us.  We're  going to help out last-minute shoppers' check out some of the products that  we have on set.  Get your take on this.  First, we've got a Callaway GBD  Epic Driver. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  This is the newest, hottest driver in the market.  It just came  out January, and it's got new technology they call jailbreak technology,  got titanium in front of the club face, clearly the number one driver.  A  great gift for dad.  We have many of them in our stores so people should  come to our stores and buy them this weekend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us about your range finders.  What is the Bushnell  technology offering?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  It's unbelievable these days.  You can shoot them, and shoot  handle will vibrate.  It's all about distance and accuracy.  They're so  much better than in the past.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes Dagen, what do you got there?</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't know.  He can tell us  the number one - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're holding this putter here.  It's got lights on it. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  I can't see what you are looking at.  That tailor-made part -  that's the part that Rory just put into play.  That is one of the hottest  putters clearly.  Jason Day is playing that putter; Sergio won with that  putter at the Masters.  It's heavy as you can see.  It's more stable,  allows for better role.  It's a great putter and those guys playing really  well with it as you see. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jordan Spieth, one of golf's greatest moneymakers his deal with  Under Armour has introduced must-have products on the course.  Does the  store carry anything from Under Armour?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  We carry all the apparel from Under Armour.  We carry shirts,  pants.  This is a new Spieth One shoe.  And golf shoes have come a long  way, not just about the look of the shoe, it is about performance.  These  are very, very lightweight.  These are in stores at $199, another great  gift for dad and these are designed by Jordan.  And worked with Jordan with  team Under Armour.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We came prepared.  Let me ask you about these balls.  Number  one golf ball and then, this ball engineered to perform with every club.   Tell us about these balls. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  Well, the titlist is the number one gift in the store for sure.   It's the number one ball played in all the tours, there is more pros  playing Titlist Pro V1 than any other ball I think combined.  The new ball  is Taylor made TP 5. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much are these balls?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  The golf balls are 47.99 for titlist Pro V, Taylor made ball is  a new ball.  Actually, Justin Rose hit it.  He's getting more height but  getting the same distance so the ball is landing on the green. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amazing.  Dick Sullivan, thank you.  Don't miss our live  coverage of the U.S. Open on Fox Sports Go, Fox Sports One, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That will do it for us.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it  is Friday June 16th.  Your top stories right now 6:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning.  The Leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The  Associated Press reporting Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot  confirm the news but we are watching what's coming out of Russia this  morning.  What it means for the war on terror coming up this morning.</p><p> A show of unity yesterday at the congressional baseball game last night,  both teams coming together for a prayer for their colleague Congressman  Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.</p><p> And President Trump praise lawmakers in the video message right before.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  by playing tonight, you are  showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of  violence or assaults on our democracy.  The game will go on.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the unity was short-lived unfortunately.  House minority  leader Nancy Pelosi already back at it attacking republicans blaming them  for the nastiness in politics, what she said, coming up.</p><p> Plus, two escaped prisoners back in custody this morning thanks to hero  homeowner.  He held the two men at gunpoint until authorities arrived.</p><p> A massive minivan recall to report.  FiatChrysler pulling vehicles off of  the road over airbag concerns.  We've got the details coming up.</p><p> And Snap shares under pressure, the stocks gliding.  The lowest IPO price  for the first time since going public.  Why investors are getting real  cautious on Snapchat's parent company Snap.  That's coming up.</p><p> Plus, a President Trump supporter targeted at Starbucks.  The company  forced to apologize after a barista handed her cup that read \"build a wall\"  instead of her name.</p><p> Futures indicating the markets to open this way.  Take a look at where we  stand with three and a half hours before opening bell.  The Dow industrials  expect to open higher this morning.  They got the firmer tone.  Dow  Industrial up 25.  NASDAQ up six, S&amp;P 500 up as well.</p><p> In Europe, stocks are higher as well.  Take a look at the Eurozone indices  this morning.  And we see gains across the board.  The FTSE 100 in London  up two-thirds of one percent.  And the CAC quarante up three quarters of  one percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close.  The Asian markets, as  you see.  Nikkei average in Japan up half a percent.  Hang Seng also  higher.  Although the Shanghai Composite in China was lower.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me right now from  Erin Hills at the U.S. Open, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, BGC  partner, senior strategist and Fox News Contributor, Steve Cortes.  Great  to see you.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Beautiful morning here at Erin Hills.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the viewers get to see it but it's impossible to capture  even over TV or in word as the suns comes up here.  How gorgeous it is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely beautiful.  They were just mowing the lawn, getting  ready for tee off in about an hour and a half.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It speaks to the kind of hospitality and the warmth and beauty  that we've experienced here.</p><p> CORTES:  It's called welcome to the Midwest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like how you're the self-appointed ambassador and you're from  Illinois.</p><p> CORTES:  I'm from Chicago not very far away.  But it is amazing this early  in the morning here in the course.  The serenity of the place.  It won't be  serene in a few hours.  It'll be ruckus with a lot of people, a lot of golf  going on.  But it's an incredible setting.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  Good word, serenity, I like that.</p><p> Meanwhile, ISIS leader apparently reportedly killed.  We're going to be  talking about that, big story there.  President Trump said a long time ago,  let Russia help us on this.</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, and listen, obviously, I think this is -- not that we want  to celebrate that but this is good news, I think for the world and you're  exactly right.  I'm clearly a President Trump partisan.  We worked hard in  his campaign.  But he was right that we have no allusions that Russia is  our friend, generally.  I think they're more foe than friend.  But there  are times when we have common interest.  And when it comes to ISIS, we have  a very common interest in the Islamist terror.  And so we should welcome  their participation and their help and I think this is great news.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  Well, this is great news if they actually killed the leader of  ISIS which is what we're hearing this morning.</p><p> Coming up this morning joining the conversation the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson is with us this morning.  President of the Jacob Leinenkugel  Brewing Company, Dick Leinenkugel is with us.  Texas Congressman Brian  Babin is here.  And the CEO of Harley-Davidson, Matt Levatich is with us as  well.</p><p> We've got a big show ahead.  So do stay with us throughout.</p><p> First off, we kick it off right now to the -- with what could be a major  military victory for Russia.  The country this morning is claiming that it  may have killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria.  In a statement  issued to Russian news agencies, the defense ministries says that the  country's Air Force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria.  The group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p> A top U.S. military spokesperson tells Fox News they cannot confirm the  report at this time, previous reports of al-Baghdadi death has been false.   Raqqa, of course, has been attacked on the ground and by the air by  American-backed Kurdish and Arab forces which have been closing in on the  terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now, republican congressman Chuck Fleischmann of  Tennessee.  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> CHUCK FLEISCHMANN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, TENNESSEE:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTRIOMO:  If true, how significant a development is this in the fight  against ISIS?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Oh, it's very significant.  There needs to be a world combat  against ISIS.  ISIS has been bad.  They have grown, they have spread like a  cancer and anytime that we can take out one of their leaders or deter their  horrible agenda, it's a victory for mankind.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will we get actual confirmation?  I mean, how long do you think  until we know this is actually fact?  Because I know there have been a lot  of rumors that he -- over the last several years, in fact?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  The fact that the rumors are that the Russians actually did  it, it may take a while for the intelligence community to pick that up and  to get confirmation.  But ultimately, whether it was Jihadi John or anybody  else who had a horrible agenda like ISIS, any of these terrorist leaders,  when they have been killed, the truth ultimately always comes out.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  But as significant as this  might be the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, American are worried,  Europeans are certainly worried about homegrown terrorists.  </p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That that's one of the biggest and major concerns.  So to that  point, what is law enforcement, what are the intelligence agencies doing  different or doing an addition to what they have been doing to make sure  that these individuals are rooted out?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let me say this, I experienced homegrown terrorism in  Chattanooga, Tennessee, my hometown, where we lost five brave, great  soldiers and sailors.  There's a horrible attack.  So unfortunately, people  have been radicalized.  The step in the right direction would be to do what  I did.  I entered a bill -- or introduced a bill in the house to basically  combat terrorism here in America.</p><p> So we're trying to combat radicalization wherever it is but I think we do a  better job abroad sometimes than we actually do in the United States.  And  I think our intelligence community is catching up with the reality that  these people with a bad agenda whether it's ISIS, Al-Qaeda or any group of  radical Islamic terrorism has got to be stopped and the best way to do that  is to combat their hateful ideology with proper education and to reach out  and tell people exactly what they are doing.  And one of the best tools in  -- and my bill basically was going to do this.  It was going to take people  who had informally part of this bad organization who had been radicalized,  who've seen the light, who turned good and basically they were going to be  used to combat the spread of this radical horrible ideology.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, let me turn out to the congressional baseball game  last night.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course, you witnessed the shooting of your fellow colleague  Steve Scalise and others on Wednesday morning.  You were there, you played  in the game last night.  How did it feel to be out on that field last  night?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  It was probably one of the most special moments that I've  experienced in my entire lifetime.  Since I've been in congress, I've seen  carnage, I alluded to the fact that we lost the five brave Americans in  Chattanooga a couple years ago.  Last night, after having experienced just  the day before the horrors of a gunman, a madman, we saw a great healing.   We showed the American people that whether we're republicans, whether we're  democrats, whether we're partisans or nonpartisans that we do unite when it  comes to the important things.</p><p> Baseball is a great American sport.  I've played it since I've been five  years old.  I'll be 55 in October.  As my coaches telling me, I'm still  good.  I went out there last night and I gave it all but I gave my heart to  Representative Scalise, to Mr. Mica, to the capitol police officers who've  been wounded, actually saving our lives, it's the beginning of a long  healing process.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you give us an update on Steve Scalise?  Do you know  anything new in terms of his condition?</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  I do not, other than I heard thank God he was improving.  I  am so thankful that President Trump and Vice President Pence have been able  to visit him.  And I just hope and pray for his full recovery.  He is a  dear friend.  He's more than a colleague.  He is a dear friend.  We have  played baseball together.  We have surfed together.  And he's just a great  American and my heart goes out to him and his family and I pray for a full  and speedy recovery for all involved.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he is.  Thank you so much, congressman.  It's good to have  you on the program this morning.  We'll be watching, thank you.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p> Coming up next, President Trump cracking down on illegal immigration,  cancelling the Obama era policy that protected some from deportation.  How  the change will impact Homeland Security?  We're covering that next.</p><p> Then FiatChrysler recalls nearly 300,000 cars as the auto company says  airbags may unintentionally deploy in certain vehicles.  We've got the  details straight-ahead after this break.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump scrapping in immigration policy  from the Obama administration which protected immigrant parents from being  deported.  Lauren Simonetti on all details right now.  Headlines in New  York.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  Happy Friday, everybody.   President Trump making good on another one of his key campaign promises.   Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly formally revoking the program aimed  at protecting parents and of U.S. citizens and legal residents from being  deported.</p><p> President Obama announced the program back in 2014 but it was never fully  launched because it was apparently blocked by a federal court.  Republicans  criticizing the effort calling it back door amnesty.</p><p> Well, Fiat Chrysler recalling 297,000 minivans in North America for wiring  problem that can lead to unintended airbag deployment.  The recall of 2011  and '12 model year Dodge Grand Caravan minivans has been linked to eight  minor injuries.  The recall will begin in late July.  Dealers will replace  the wiring if needed and add protective covering.</p><p> Say it isn't so.  Butterfingers.  Nestle putting its candy business up for  sale.  The Swiss company trying to get a healthier bottom line as customers  are on the world demand healthier snacks.  The unit could be worth as much  as $3 billion.</p><p> And have you guys seen this one?  A loyal Starbucks customer in Charlotte,  North Carolina says she was targeted for supporting Donald Trump.  Kayla  Hart walked into a Starbucks, as she usually does.  This time she was  wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt and look at this.  She said her order was  labeled with that political message \"build a wall\" instead of her name and  she was ridiculed for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KAYLA HART:  Build a wall and kind of shoves my drink at me and then all of  the baristas in the back started cracking up laughing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hart says she's waiting to hear from the Starbucks district  manager before deciding whether she's going to give them her business once  again, Maria.  Unbelievable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Lauren Simonetti.   That term doesn't seem like a negative insult to me and I would have said,  great.  You would have left.</p><p> CORTES:  I would have absolutely left.  I will tell you this.  As a Trump  guy who campaigned for Trump and who was -- I was accosted on public  transportation several times, complete strangers.  And far worst turns in  that.  I don't think that's insulting, by the way.  Trump campaigned on  build a wall.  So I think -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But they were laughing at her, that's why she was upset.</p><p> CORTES:  And I'm sure they were trying to ridicule her.  And here's the  thing too.  I think it is important -- I think Dagen was mentioning off  camera that a lot of us have lost our sense of humor when it comes to  politics.  Politics had become such blood sport.  Our country is so  divided.  There's times that we can't laugh about it and there are some  things that we should laugh about it.  To me, if somebody showed me that  cup of build a wall, that's funny.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And I would have been like, yeah, build that wall.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, humor has just disappeared in the world of political  discourse.  Could everybody so offended by everything?  I say bring it  back.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that's the right word that he said blood sport.  It has  become blood sport.</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, I do think too.  On a more serious point though too, why  are we so divided?  Right?  And I think we're the most divided.  We should  have been my lifetime and from my read of history, maybe the most since the  civil war, I think possibly, 60's were pretty divisive from what I can  gather.  I wasn't around then.  But in my lifetime I the most divided we've  been.  But why?</p><p> I think a couple of reasons.  One is identity politics which I think have  just run a muck, constantly identifying ourselves by our ethnic group, by  our gender.  I think that that has reached - has extenuated division.  And  then I think secondly and most importantly, slow economic growth.  Economic  anxiety always exacerbates whatever other tensions exist.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Quote Bill Murray and strikes lighten up.  That will actually  reduce a lot of the anger and rage and divisiveness if people can just kind  of step back and take a breath.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> Still ahead, safety concerns for navy jet pilots to report.  Fox News  correspondent Lea Gabrielle will explain why training is currently at a  standstill for trainees.  We'll get into it next.  </p><p> Then our investors losing confidence in Snap.  What about the whole tech  sector?  The fallout after Snap sunk to its IPO price to $70 a share and  then broke it yesterday.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at Snap.  This was one of the  big stories in the stock market yesterday.  It has been anything but  picture perfect for the company.  Since it's Wall Street debut, Snap shares  fell to the IPO price yesterday of $17 a share.  And you know, we have seen  some churn going on in technology in general, right?  A lot of those big  tech names that have been the leadership of this market last year have  turned over.  What do you think about is?</p><p> CORTES:  Maria, I'll say and I've been on air pretty critical of Snapchat  and mainly because here's my sort of grand thesis, is that they sell for  free a product to a lot of people who generally don't have money,  teenagers.  But having said that, people -- I've got three teen daughters  at home, they live on Snap.  I mean, absolutely live on it.  They don't  text -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how do you monetize it?  Are they making money?</p><p> CORTES:  but here's the caveat to all of that and that's my negative  comment on Snap.  But here's my positive comment and this just happened, I  believe, this week, McDonald's is hiring a quarter million workers and  they're going to do it via Snap.  They want their applications to come  which is very interesting to me.  That's very intriguing, it made me  rethink my bearish opinion of the company that if this can become a bit of  a teenager or millennial LinkedIn, well, that's utility then.  That's not  just sort of fun and silliness and that might be a way that they can  actually monetize.</p><p> So anyway, makes me rethink at least.  Back of the IPO price for somebody  who's been pretty skeptical of the company, I'm rethinking that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The issue I have always had with Snap is that it doesn't have  that high barrier to entry and you've seen Facebook and Facebooks,  Instagram innovating on this front and really rolling out Snap-like  features to not only hang onto their existing user base -- but also -- it's  a little windy here at the U.S. Open.  But also to draw -- this is  millennials age, draw people away from Snapchat and I think that that was  something that wasn't priced into the IPO initially, the ease with which  that customers can leave Snapchat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the other tech names?  You're talking  about Amazon, Google, all of the names, Apple, that have been really the  leadership of this market and yet, we're seeing a bit of a pullback?</p><p> CORTES:  I think that it's natural, to put it in context, I think compared  with the rally that they saw, particularly since the election, it's not  that material.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But look at this chart right here.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, I mean, those things are very volatile if you just got in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This week for Amazon.</p><p> CORTES:  But I also think to connect the dots here between markets and  politics.  It's ironic to me that Silicon Valley which is a place where  President Trump is probably not terribly popular, I don't think they're  going to hold a parade.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was the understatement of more than so far.</p><p> CORTES:  But it's been wonderful for Silicon Valley.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And next week, the White House is having a technology summit,  all the CEO's of big tech companies have signed on.  They're going to go to  the White House.  They're going to talk about modernizing government.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They certainly want tax reform.  Corporate tax reform.  And that  was one thing that universally every tech CEO was excited about.  So  they're going to give the president and the White House staff an earful  about pushing that harder -- pushing those republicans in congress on that  much harder than they have been.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, then there's Twitter.  Looking to jazz up the brand.   The company rolls out a new design on both the website and the app.  We're  using Twitter all the time.  I just tweeted out the shot of them hosing and  getting the golf course ready.  Is this enough you think to keep investors  happy?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I still think that Twitter wind up getting bought by  somebody.  Because it does have a great installed user base.  A  professionals who use Twitter for basically a news delivery service.   That's how you use it.  But I think in the last week, you've seen one of  the major problems with Twitter and that is the level of hate speech and  vitriol and partisan name calling that has been a problem and that's one of  the reasons that a lot of these potential acquirers of Twitter have turned  away from it because they don't want to be associated with that and you  can't monetize nastiness.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Same problem though.  How do you monetize?</p><p> CORTES:  I do think you're right, Dagen, though.  I do think that there is  a floor relatively close because of that takeover potential.  I'm not  saying that means necessarily buy the stock, but I do think there's  somewhat of an embedded -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who wants it?  We've been down this road before.  Nobody want  it.</p><p> CORTES:  And I will say the same time.  Look, when you have the president  of the United States who has become the Twitter in chief who lives on this  medium and it still can't seem to monetize, right?  That I will admit  that's a problem, that comes from somebody, I use it all day every day for  business reasons, for sports reasons, for fun, it's incredible but I don't  spend a dime.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That goes to the point though.  If you say you follow President  Trump and you retweet everything that he does, Twitter identifies that,  what are they going to sell to you?  What ads are they going to serve to  you other than \"Make America Great Again\" hats and t-shirts?  What does  that say about what type of shampoo or laundry detergent you like?  It  doesn't say anything, quite frankly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And also, how you're going to add an advertisement to 140  characters?  You can't.  I mean, there's no advertising revenue model.</p><p> CORTES:  And that's where Facebook, I think, right?  We have learned  clearly was much superior in terms of monetizing, right?  And in terms of  not being limited by the characters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take a short break.  When we come back, keeping America  safe.  A reported additional 4,000 troops will be headed to Afghanistan to  break a stalemate with the Taliban.  What the deployment means for  President Trump and the country?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from the U.S. Open at Erin Hills Golf Course in  Wisconsin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, everybody.

We've got a  preview of the highly-anticipated new film ahead of the weekend.</p><p> First, though, breaking news this morning, Russia has claimed that it has  killed the head of ISIS.  The country is investigating reports that an  airstrike in Syria took out Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last  month.  The U.S. has not confirmed this death but we're waiting on more  information.  Joining us right now is Fox News Correspondent, former Navy  fighter pilot, Lea Gabrielle.  Lea, thanks for joining the conversation.   What would al-Baghdadi's death mean for the war on terror in your view?</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first off, Maria, I  think we just have to take this with a bit of skepticism at this point.   And I know that the intelligence community and the U.S. military are going  to be looking at evidence and all of our ability to get situational  awareness on this to figure out, did he actually die?  Because there have  been reports in the past even back in 2015, there were reports that he was  killed but then in May of that same year, he released a radio or an audio  message basically urging Muslims to immigrate to the caliphate.  He is  somebody, who there has been essentially a bounty on him for quite some  time.  So it would be significant if he was killed but again, I think at  this point, we have to take it with some skepticism until we hear more from  us officials.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, you are waiting on information.  When do you  expect we will hear - or, I mean, how quickly do you think they can get to  the bottom of it?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's really tough to be able to say right now.  You  know, there are a lot of different sources of information that the U.S.  will be using, we'll be using our own sources of information but also  working with allies and I would expect that the U.S. would also be trying  to get information from Russia to find out what sort of evidence they do  have to assess whether or not he was actually killed. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Lea, training for jet pilots in the U.S. Navy still at a  standstill, I want to get your take on this.  In April, pilots of the  Navy's jet trainer refused to fly because of safety concerns.  You've been  talking about this for a long time, and of course, the Navy ordered a pause  in training while it conducted a review of the problems.  You were first to  obtain the result of the review and you spoke exclusively to the Navy's  number two officer.  Tell us about it.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, Maria, the bottom line is that the Navy still can't say  when the T-45, the Navy's only jet trainer will actually start flying  again.  And the report says that finding a solution to the problem has  proved elusive, that's a quote.  In other words, there isn't one yet.  The  issues with the basic life support systems in the both the T-45 trainer and  in the F-18 Hornet, those are systems that are supposed to provide clean  breathable air to the aircrew but reports of incidents where pilots and  crew became impaired have been on the rise, increasing in a lot of models  last year.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I visited with in Virginia Beach for an exclusive look at the  latest technology being used to train F-18 pilots to handle aircraft system  failures that have been plaguing the fleet.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's say we got the feel of the nose there.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  The reduced oxygen breathing device allows pilots to experience  oxygen loss while flying but in the safety of a simulator.  As a former F- 18 pilot, I gave it a try.</p><p> CMDR. JEFF FARMER, VFA-131 COMMANDING OFFICER:  If we can put this oxygen  mask on and slowly decrease that amount of oxygen concentration that we're  getting to simulate as best we can exactly what would the pilot would  experience in the airplane itself.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  All set.  Hands up.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Pilots could become dizzy, euphoric or even pass out.</p><p> Basically, what I fell is (INAUDIBLE) it's severely uncomfortable.  It's  hard to concentrate.</p><p> FARMER:  So far, it's been very successful in helping people recognize  those symptoms before they experience any kind of cognitive or, you know,  worst yet, loss of consciousness.  Your heart rate is coming up a little  bit.  You might notice that yourself.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  One training goal, to recognize the symptoms and pool a green  ring, which gives the pilot up to 10 minutes of emergency oxygen.</p><p> One of the reasons for all this training in a simulator is because pilots  are reporting more problems in planes like these, and when you're flying in  the air in an F-18, it can be a matter of life and death.  In fact, we  learned some pilots are more concerned about their life support systems  failing than the risk of combat.  The pilot we spoke within Virginia  disagree.</p><p> CAPT. MARC MIGUEZ, CARRIER AIR WING THREE COMMANDER:  I see no problems  operating safety under our current mitigation strategy that we're doing  right now.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  The Navy review released just today said it view these episodes  as a number one safety priority and announced an unconstrained resource  approach to finding a solution.  I spoke with Admiral Bill Moran who  ordered the review.</p><p> ADM. BILL MORAN, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS:  The system, the aircraft  ought to operate the way it was designed to operate.  And it's up to us to  figure out how to get that airplane back to that level of performance.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, as you saw in the case of a system failure, pilots have  to manually activate emergency oxygen even if they're impaired.  Admiral  Moran says that an automatic system is the goal.  He also tells me that if  they're not able to get the training site going again by the end of the  summer, it will impact operational readiness.  But, Maria, he said that -  he says that the Navy is getting close.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this a cost issue?  I mean, what does this mean for the F-35  program, and what's behind it, Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's - those are two great questions.  I mean, first of  all, I did ask Admiral Moran about the cost.  And he said that they are  putting all the resources into this.  That cause is not a factor in trying  to solve this problem.  So, it's an unconstrained resource approach, it's  basically what they're calling it in the Navy.  Now, the F-35 is  essentially a different animal, but it's a Navy jet, it's an Air Force jet,  it's a Marine Corps jet, and a wing in Arizona.  Just had to ground the F- 35 because of this type of problem where there were 5 reported incidents.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> Now, reportedly, they're going to start flying again probably this weekend,  but the same issues are impacting the F-35, Maria.  Of course, the F-35  program is an extremely costly program.  It's sort of a jack of all trades  and it's been a struggle making it an airplane that can sort of master so  many different trades, Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You make all great points.  I want to bring the panel in  here because we have been talking about the age of the Navy fleet, the Army  fleet, but we're talking about some of the oldest fleets in decades, and  that is a cost issue.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And General Mattis actually -  I think it was yesterday - made a comment about the sequestration and the  budget, the defense budget cuts that were in that and how devastating that  was, and that it will take years for the defense department to recover from  that.  But however, the upside is that you do have a President now in  Donald Trump dedicated to rebuilding the defense and our - and our  military.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know - yes, I think, Maria, to that point and I'm  sure Lea is correct that this particular issue isn't a cost issues but in  general, I think there's a ton of cost issues.  If you talk to people -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, that's why he's focused on it in the budget.</p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  And if you talk to  people in the military, they will say we are simply not ready.  We're not  ready to fight.  And by the way, it's unconscionable to put our fighting  men and women into the position where they don't have the proper equipment  or training that they need to probably defend America.  And I think it's  one of the reasons that Trump won and to also connect the dots between the  policy here and markets, I think the markets certainly believe that we're  going to spend what we need to if you look at Boeing stocks, for instance.   Boeing hitting another huge all-time high just yesterday.  I think, to me,  that has been really a Trump stock because of combination of defense and  infrastructure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though he was one of the first people that Trump  called out.</p><p> CORTES:  I know.  Ironically.  Ironically, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On Twitter.  Meanwhile, Lea, then there's the war in  Afghanistan.  The Pentagon reportedly planning to send nearly 4,000  additional troops to the country to break the stalemate with the Taliban.   The President gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the power to determine  troop levels in Afghanistan earlier this week.  What's your take on this?   Will this turn the tide of the war?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, it's going to be necessary to turn the tide of the war,  and that's according to the senior commander on the ground there who said  that additional troops are needed in order to do that.  The Taliban  fighting season is about to get underway there, so I think that that's  probably part of the reason for this decision right now, but of course,  Secretary Mattis has just said that we are not winning there.  So, the only  way to win is to increase the number of troops level and I think - troop  levels, and I think that that's what they're trying to do.  They -- the  Pentagon is reviewing the strategy in Afghanistan, and the Secretary of  Defense said that that may take several weeks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a stunning comment that Secretary Mattis made the  other day, wasn't it, that we are not winning in Afghanistan.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  Well - and you know, listen, I think the honesty is  important, all right.  And then, how do we address it?  How do we start to  win?  And perhaps 4,000 more troops is the first step there.  I will tell  you I'm normally on board with the Trump administration on just about  everything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CORTES:  I worry about us escalating Afghanistan.  I worry about the  quagmire, we've been there for a heck of a long time, and we really won  over the hearts and minds of the people, I'm not so sure, but I do love the  honesty of the analysis of the situation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It certainly was.  Lea, great to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lea Gabrielle there.  Coming up, from clicks to bricks,  Amazon's new patent that could stop in-store customers from comparing the  company's prices online.  We'll tell you about that coming next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're live from beautiful Erin Hills this morning in Wisconsin  for the 117th U.S. Open.  We have the very latest on the Open day two here  in Erin Hills.  Welcome back.  We're looking at markets that are going to  be opening higher this morning.  Futures are indicating some firmness right  here.  Take a look at the Dow Industrials up about 20 points, NASDAQ up  about 9 points, fractionally off of the highs of the morning.  </p><p> A couple names we're watching this morning, Kroger is one to watch, for  sure.  Shares of the grocery giant fell nearly 20 percent yesterday after  the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast.  Kroger blamed the  move on higher product costs.  Kroger shares this morning are fractionally  higher.  We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent  that can stop in-store shoppers from comparing prices on their phones.  The  technology allows stores to see what a shopper is searching for while  connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can then take action like e-mail a  coupon or suggesting comparable items, even block access to competitive  content.  Amazon shares are up this morning.  I don't know if I like this  technology.  What do you guys think about that?</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  It's a bit Big Brother-ish but then again -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's very Big Brother-ish.</p><p> CORTES:  -- you also don't have to get on their Wi-Fi, right?  Just do it  on your - I'm not sure that -- I don't think that - I'm no techie, but I  don't think Amazon could stop you from just being on your mobile signal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But if you want to go online and see if a -- you can get a  product somewhere else cheaper, you should be able to.  I don't know if I'm  in Amazon or not.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's my two cents on it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, a nationwide manhunt ended in triumph for Tennessee  law enforcement yesterday.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details in New  York this morning.  She's got headlines.  Lauren?</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Quite a story, Maria.   Two inmates who escaped from a Georgia prison back on Tuesday, they were  captured after attempting to steal a Tennessee man's car.  Police say the  man held the fugitives at gunpoint with a neighbor until law enforcement  came to arrest them.  Prior to this, the pair held a Tennessee couple  hostage in their home, tying them up with a rope, eating their food, and  stealing their stuff.  </p><p> Well, Ricky Dubose and Donnie Rowe, there they are, both serving time for  armed robbery.  They escaped the Putnam County jail after shooting two  prison guards and driving off in a hijacked vehicle.  They are being  extradited back to Georgia where they will face multiple charges.  Nike  wants to be quicker on its feet so it's cutting 1400 jobs and eliminating a  quarter of its shoe styles as it faces increase competition from smaller  brands and premium labels, all part of a plan to also start selling  sneakers more directly to customers online.</p><p> Big win for Netflix, leapfrogging cable T.V.  According to a new study,  Netflix have more 50 million subscribers last quarter, that's 2 million  more than cable marketing.  The first time Netflix has taken the lead.  </p><p> And Jean Simmons says the horns are mine.  The longtime member of Kiss has  filed an application with the U.S. patent and trademark office Friday to  claim his official ownership of that hand gesture right there, the horns.   His legal team included a sketch of the gesture, plus a picture of him  using it.  A trademark typically protects brand names and logos on goods  and services, but now maybe hand gestures, too.  Maria, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  So, what do you - what do you guys  think?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is the dumbest idea ever.  This is not associated with  Kiss.  I do this every time I did \"RED EYE\" and every time I do \"KENNEDY\".   It's just -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you didn't get it from him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's having a (INAUDIBLE) I don't listen to Kiss.  And by the  way, how about the Texas Longhorns.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  I was going to say.  For the - for the Texas Longhorn  nation, they will view this as their Alamo to fight against losing - right?  - the hook and horns.  He might as well trademark the thumbs-up, right?   Now - but having said all of that, this is -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now, Donald Trump is going to -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, it's a thumbs down and -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CORTES:  Jean Simmons is a marketing genius and he might have done this for  this exact reason.  We're talking about him, he's been shown on air.  So  perhaps -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You got us, Jean.  You got us.</p><p> CORTES:  Perhaps his method (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, make me pay for this.  Make me pay to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, will the new Cars movie drive into the number one  spot at the box office this weekend?  Are you going to the film, have a  kid-friendly flick?  We'll we stack up next to Wonder Woman.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we get some pictures?  </p><p> MCQUEEN:  Yes, yes.  Come on, let's get a picture.  You know what, get  (INAUDIBLE) picture because champ here has been a role model of mine for  years now, and I mean, a lot of years, right?  I love this guy.  I think I  touched a nerve.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from the new Disney Pixar film Cars 3, hitting  theaters this weekend.  It's the third installment in a series which  follows racecar Lightning McQueen as he struggles with growing older.</p><p> Joining us right now in the Fox Light host and Senior Vice President of  Marketing at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:   Maria, good to see you.  Where is everyone?  Again, I'm alone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're here at the U.S. Open.  We're here at Erin Hills.  We  wish you were - we wish you were here, Michael.  So, let me ask you about  Cars because Wonder Woman is still on fire, right?  But the last Cars film  grossed $66 million opening weekend at the box office.  What are you  expecting?  You think it stacks up against the record-breaking Wonder Woman  this weekend?</p><p> TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  I think it's going to - in this - the fast lane to  number one at this weekend's box office.  Look, Wonder Woman is probably  going to be the movie of the summer 2017.  It's on track to get about $500  million so far, and is opening up in 7 more markets across the globe this  weekend, but Cars?  Look, we're hearing a lot about franchise fatigue this  summer between Aliens and Pirates of the Caribbean.  This is one franchise  that is still hot.  It looks to take in 55 about to $60 million this  weekend, pretty good.  Not bad for Disney which has had an incredible year  between Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's another family-friendly movie, which is always  loved.  By the way, last weekend, I saw Wonder Woman.  I thought it was  good.</p><p> TAMMERO:  What did you think?  Fantastic, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I liked it a lot.  I - well, I didn't know the story  of when she was a young girl, so that was interesting.  But here we are at  Erin Hills, Michael, and you ranked the top three golf films of all time in  honor of our live coverage from the U.S. Open.  Give me your number three  pick.</p><p> TAMMERO:  We did.  I asked people on social media and it was almost  consensus.  No one agrees on social media but everyone said these three  movies.  So, number three, Maria, of the top golf movies of all time,  debuted in 1996, Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, and Don  Johnson.  The story about a washed-up golf pro working at a driving range  who tries to qualify for the U.S. Open in order to win the heart of his  successful girlfriend.  It debuted at number one and earned about $53  million at the box office.  That was a good story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a great story.  One of my faves, Dagen.  And you - and  you and I love Kevin Costner.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love that movie and I love the fact that it's basically like  my Major League because Rene Russo was in Major League with Tom Barringer,  so it just made (INAUDIBLE) golf.  It's a very similar storyline, actually.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Probably the last thing for Don Johnson, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  He was good in that, too.  It was a great  film.  I don't know if that would be my number three pick, it might even be  - it might be my number two, but what is your number two pick, Michael?</p><p> TAMMERO:  Number two, 1996, Adam Sandler.  I feel like old Adam Sandler  movies should be introduced with a sigh.  Happy Gilmore debuted at number  two at the box office, bringing in about $38 million.  A rejected hockey  player puts his skills to the golf course to save his grandmother's house.   One of the big hits of Adam Sandler but not his biggest.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, Maria, we can only hope that Bob Barker is going to get in a  fight somewhere today on Erin Hills, right, and reenact my favorite scene  from that movie.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a great movie, it was so funny.  We will see about  that.  All right.  We are down to number one, Michael, and I think we all  agree this is set certainly a winner.  Let's take a look at the clip from  your number one pick.  Watch this.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Let's do it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This crowd has gone deadly silent.  Cinderella story.   I don't know where, a former greenskeeper, now about to become the Masters  champion.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It looks like I'm going to rack.  It's in the whole.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Caddyshack.  Who can doubt this is probably the top golf movie of  all time?  It debuted at number one, $39 million at the box office back in  1980, starring Chevy Chase, what a cast, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill  Murray, all chasing that little gopher around the golf course blowing  things up, which is what I want to do when I play golf because I'm awful at  it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Ted Knight makes it, right, as Judge Smails?</p><p> TAMMERO:  That's right.  Not to be confused with -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TAMMERO:  Not to be confused with Caddyshack 2, starring Jackie Mason,  which was just god-awful.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God, you're right.  I forgot about that.  So, why was  Caddyshack your - Caddyshack your top pick?  It's - I mean, I know  everybody online liked it.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You know, it's funny, I watched it last night and it holds up.   It's a classic movie from the 80s.  You know, Bill Murray and Rodney  Dangerfield at their best.  I recommend everyone this weekend celebrate the  U.S. Open and go back and watch it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a great point.  Yes, you're right, it was really funny.   Michael, great to see you.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Good to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend.</p><p> TAMMERO:  You, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael Tammero joining us there.  Still, ahead, more from the  beautiful grounds of Erin Hills here in Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open,  as round two is kicking off next hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay right  here.

Happy Friday -- everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us here in Erin Hills, Wisconsin.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, June 16th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Breaking news this morning -- the leader of ISIS reportedly has been  killed.  The Associated Press reporting that Russia is claiming that it  killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the  U.S. military says that they cannot confirm this news but the President has  long stressed that getting help is the way to take down ISIS.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have a lot of  great success over the next coming years.  And we want to get as many to  help fight terrorism as possible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What this means to the war on terrorism, coming up this  morning.</p><p> Meanwhile Facebook ramps up its efforts against extremist content. The  social media giant is now turning to artificial intelligence to do so.  We  will have the details.</p><p> A show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  are coming together for a prayer for their colleague; Congressman Steve  Scalise still in critical condition.  They did that ahead of the first  pitch last night.</p><p> Scalise underwent another surgery.  He is still in critical condition but  the hospital says his condition has improved in the last 24 hours.</p><p> New details this morning on the health of Otto Warmbier, the American  detainee just released from North Korea.  The 22-year-old has extensive  brain damage and is in a persistent vegetative state.</p><p>Amazon reportedly eyeing an acquisition, the retail giant now looking to  get into the messaging space.  Why they may see Slack as a growth  opportunity.</p><p> And futures indicating a higher opening for markets this morning -- take a  look.  This Friday morning, we're looking at money moving into stocks.  Dow  Industrials up about 20 points.  Nasdaq up about 10 points, fractional  moves, nonetheless in the plus-plus column.</p><p> In Europe, similar story -- stocks are higher across the board in the  Eurozone.  The indices look like this.  FT100 up two-thirds of 1 percent as  is the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX index in Germany up a quarter of a  percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, mostly higher in fact.  Best  performer was Japan -- Nikkei average up one-half of 1 percent.</p><p> It is day two of the U.S. Open.  It is getting underway shortly.  We have a  recap of yesterday's action. Everything you need to know as golfers tee up  today.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk about it,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and BGC Partners senior strategist  Fox News contributor Steve Cortes with us as well.</p><p> I'm looking forward to hearing the claps.  It's just so relaxing when you  see them beginning to tee off.  </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  As I mentioned before, a golf  course in the morning this early -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CORTES:  -- there is a certain serenity.  But there won't be serenity soon.   They'll be cheering and a raucous nature to this place and it's exciting.   I am so glad as a Midwesterner that the U.S. Open has decided to come back  to the Midwest.  And I think -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I like how you being from Chicago, from Illinois, you're taking  credit.  </p><p> CORTES:  I've appointed myself.  I'm not going to tell people of Wisconsin  -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's like me taking credit, for like the way people get  treated in Alabama, for example.</p><p> CORTES:  And here at a relatively new golf course which is also unique.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's just talk about yesterday.  The players have never played  this course.  And it's a different course.  It's real long -- what was the  tallying (ph) of yesterday?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Nine miles.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nine miles they're walking as opposed to six miles, which is  sort of the average.  </p><p> CORTES:  Right.  And hilly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And hilly.</p><p> CORTES:  No, I think it definitely will favor -- a hot day yesterday.   We'll see what it's like today and into the weekend.  Nice and cool now,  but we'll see once the sun comes up.</p><p> I think that tends to favor the fitter golfers, the younger golfers.  So  it's a more physical test perhaps than they're used on some other courses.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big story of the day, of course, the head of ISIS may have been  killed.  We want to follow that this morning.</p><p> Coming up talking all about it this morning and joining the conversation is  the CEO of Kalahari Resort Todd Nelson is here; the President of Jacob  Leinenkugel Brewing Company Dick Leinenkugel; Texas Congressman Brian Babin  is with us; and the CEO of Harley-Davidson Matthew Levatich is with us as  well; plus PGA Tour Superstore president and CEO Dick Sullivan is with us  as well.  He'll give us an update on what we're seeing today in golf and  the golf business in general.</p><p> First though, our top story this hour.  What could be a major military  victory for Russia -- the country claiming that it may have killed ISIS  leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria one month ago.  In the statement  issued through Russian news agencies, the defense ministry there says that  the country's air force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria the group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p> Now the U.S. military says that it cannot confirm this news yet.  We're  waiting for more confirmation from the U.S.  But Raqqa, of course, has been  under attack on the ground and by air by American-backed Kurdish and Arab  forces which have been closing in on the terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now is a former army intelligence officer Andrew Peek.   Andrew -- thanks so much for weighing in here.  What do you think this  means in the fight against ISIS?</p><p> ANDREW PEEK, FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Well, gosh -- if Russian  forces killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic state it would  be singlehandedly the biggest justification for Donald Trump's foreign  policy to date.  You know, I think it would really be a massive stamp of  approval for his efforts to reach out to Russia and to make concessions in  other parts of the world like Eastern Europe in exchange for getting more  cooperation against the Islamic state in Syria and Iraq.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because even during the campaign, then candidate Trump said  many times -- look ok, Russia may not be our friend but there's no reason  we should not be working side-by-side with them against terrorism, against  ISIS.  Let them take him out.  He said it many times.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  That's exactly right.  And he took a lot of heat from that  because that was on the heels of not just Russia interfering potentially  with the DNC e-mails and the election hacking but also about a year after  Russia had essentially invaded Ukraine and fomented a massive insurgency in  that country.</p><p> So there was a lot of legacy weight of hostility with Russia that frankly  actually mirrored what Obama came into office with in 2009 after the  Georgia war in August 2008.  However, if Baghdadi is actually dead, that  would be a mark of approval for Trump's foreign policy and really I think  put to rest a lot of the conspiracy theories in this town in Washington  about his obeisance to Moscow.  </p><p> CORTES:  Well, you know -- hey, Steve Cortes here -- I have a question for  you.  I mean I think, you know, when we look at history for instance, we  teamed up with Stalin, very unsavory Russian character right, to take on  Hitler.  Can't we at times -- doesn't it just make good common sense for us  at times to team up with people who may be disreputable or may not have our  best interests at heart but when we have a common interest, such as  defeating ISIS doesn't it just make good strategic sense for us to then  unite as we have in this case against ISIS?  </p><p> PEEK:  No, I think it does.  I think the challenge has been in Syria that  we have two goals.  It's not just defeating ISIS but it's also replacing it  with a regime that is not Bashar al-Assad because Assad keeps gassing his  own people.  And unfortunately that is Russia's goal.</p><p> So we've been looking for a third way that involves defeating ISIS but not  winding up with Bashar al-Assad back in control of Syria.  And what I think  you have seen Trump do is make the decision that at least in the interim we  are not going to pursue both goals simultaneously.  We're going to get rid  of ISIS and then we're going to move on afterwards to dealing with the  political transition in Syria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the comment that Secretary Mattis made the other day  that we are not winning in Afghanistan.  What's your take on that --  Andrew?</p><p> PEEK:  Frankly if we weren't winning with 100,000 troops in Afghanistan  under Obama I don't know why we're going to be winning with 12,000 under  Donald Trump.  I don't know what additional difference another 4,000 troops  is going to make.  I think that that is the stopgap measure.</p><p> I think it kicks the ball down the road for when we have to have the  politically really hard discussion of when are we going to pull most of our  people out.  I think we were at the border of having that about a year ago.   I think the issue is going to be funding for the Afghan government going  forward.  But I truly don't see why 4,000 troops is going to make a big  difference.</p><p> I have to say I have the greatest respect for the commander on the ground,  Nick Nicholson.  We served together there, very smart guy, cream in the  army but I don't see this being a game changer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Andrew -- let me ask you about social media here because  Facebook is tapping artificial intelligence now.  They say it's a new push  to block terrorist propaganda.  The social media giant says that it will  use algorithms to root out words and images related to extremism.  Facebook  is using a team of 150 members including counterterrorism experts to take  down related posts.  Do you think this is enough?  What do you make of this  push by Facebook?  </p><p> PEEK:  Yes.  I don't really trust the tech companies to decide what is and  what isn't extremist speech.  You know, I think I don't want to always put  the onus on political correctness but these are West Coast companies that  over the long term are not going to be able to say hey, we're only going to  focus on Islamic radicalism and Islamic hate speech.</p><p> I think there is going to be a strong temptation to move into all kinds of  extremist speech however they want to define that from radical Islam to  radical right-wing groups to radical left-wing groups.  And that is  gradually going to bleed over into political discourse.</p><p> What I would like to see is more effort on the backend from the  intelligence community and not frankly kind of the front end with the tech  companies censoring the narrative.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Andrew, that's been one of the problems is that people cried  out that as conservatives, that their speech had been shut down by  Facebook.  You know, anytime anything is flagged by another Facebook user,  you basically get ixnayed on the site while they have allowed these sites  particularly Twitter was worse than Facebook for a very long time in terms  of allowing just rampant propaganda. </p><p> This is something that needed to happen quite frankly and they are doing it  because they would rather do it themselves than then allow the government  end because again if they don't take control of it, I'll tell you what,  folks from the government absolutely will.</p><p> And which is one more thing, these tech companies for some time legally had  to police and look for and take down and report to authorities child  pornography.  And they had automated ways to do that and they pushed back  and said well, we can't do that with terrorist propaganda but it turns out  they can and they are.  </p><p> PEEK:  Dagen -- I think that is true but the only reason they are now  pushing back on the radical Islamic themes is that they have a president  who is putting the political pressure on them, right.  Once that  administration changes, and at some point, of course it will, the pressure  is going to be off and they're going to go back to censoring a whole array  of messages at best; and at worst, none at all.</p><p> So that's really a function, there is no institutional way on the tech  companies.  It's really a function of Trump's focus on calling the enemy  radical Islam.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's great insight from you as always -- Andrew.  Thanks  so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p> PEEK:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Andrew Peek joining us there in New  York.</p><p> Coming up, grave new health concerns for the 22-year-old held hostage by  North Korea for over a year.  Why U.S. doctors now are disputing the claims  that Otto Warmbier was in a coma -- those claims from North Korea. </p><p> And a touching tribute to the original Hollywood hero -- how Los Angeles  honored Batman star Adam West last night.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open this morning.  It is round two, at least  -- meanwhile ten tornadoes have touched down in northeast Wisconsin.  That  happened yesterday.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti with the details now -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  An hour and a half from you -- Maria.</p><p> One of those tornadoes first hit in Fox Crossing yesterday afternoon,  leaving a trail of damage six miles long.  The twister had peak winds of 95  miles an hour.  Police say one man was injured by flying debris when the  roof of a car wash was torn off in Kimberly.  The local utility says the  tornado outbreak's the largest storm even it's seen since 2010.</p><p> Well, parents, you'll want to listen to this one.  A study by an  environmental group finds detectable levels of lead in 20 percent of baby  food samples.  Those samples were taken by the FDA over a 10-year period.   The types of baby food most affected -- grapes, apples, pears, mixed fruit  juices, sweet potatoes, carrots and teething biscuits.  Studies have shown  that children exposed to lead can experience behavioral problems and have  lower IQs as a result.</p><p> And doctors say an American college student released from captivity this  week by North Korea has extensive brain damage.  Otto Warmbier was held for  17 months in a North Korean jail.  Doctors describe his condition as a --  and this is a quote -- \"a state of unresponsive wakefulness.  Otto's  father, Fred Warmbier, was a guest on Fox News' \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\"  last night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FRED WARMBIER, FATHER OF OTTO WARMBIER:  This is a rogue pariah regime.   They are terrorists.  They are brutal.  There's no sense to anything here.   They have crossed a line with my son, Otto, and so it would be very  difficult to look for a lesson here amongst this insanity.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  We feel for that family.  Otto Warmbier serving a 15-year  sentence for allegedly trying to steal a political poster that contains a  slogan that he wanted to take from a wall in his hotel room in Pyongyang.</p><p> And L.A. turned into Gotham City once again last night.  This, to honor the  late Adam West, who played Batman on the TV show in the 1960s.  West died  last week at the age of 88.  At an L.A. city hall ceremony officials and  hundreds of fans were joined by Catwoman Lee Meriwether, Catwoman and Burt  Ward.

President Trump prepares  to roll back relations with Havana.  This is expected in the next couple of  days.  What it means for businesses investing in the country.</p><p> And then your next business convention could be fun for the whole family --  Kalahari Resort CEO Todd Nelson on his brilliant business model.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills here in Wisconsin.  We're at the 117th U.S. Open and  it is day two.</p><p> With school out for summer it is time to head for fun in the sun.  Kalahari  Resorts featuring three locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and right here in  Wisconsin combine a family-friendly vacation atmosphere with a state-of- the-art convention center space.  The company is now investing $65 million  to double the size of their convention space proving that a business model  that combines a waterslide park with massive convention center space is  quite the attraction.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about it is the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson.  Todd -- good to see.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> TODD NELSON, KALAHARI RESORT:  Well, thank you for having me.  It's a  pleasure to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting but usually people go on a business  trip and they don't bring their family but you are offering them to do  both.  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh yes.  And it works marvelously.  People find that their  attendance actually goes up when they have it a resort like ours.  And so  it's just a proven business.</p><p> We're doubling the size of our convention facility in Dells because our  groups have grown so large that they are outgrowing us, which is a  wonderful problem.  So we are doubling the size of that.  And we're  doubling the size of the one in the Pocono Mountains.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How is business right now?  </p><p> NELSON:  Business is outstanding.  And people love what we do.  You go and  you have fun and you play and it is -- it's basically Vegas hotel without a  casino but an indoor water park and an indoor theme park.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is so cool.</p><p> CORTES:  You know, Todd, I will tell you for all, I am a customer.  My kids  absolutely love your theme park -- the one in Wisconsin Dells.  What are  the hindrances to growth?  I mean your company is obviously doing well.  It  sounds like you're very optimistic on business.  But what are the obstacles  and particularly in terms of public policy type of scenario?  What could be  better from your perspective to grow Kalahari?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, we're in major growth mode right now.  I guess my biggest  problem is that I have more ideas and more sites than I have money.</p><p> CORTES:  Ok. </p><p> NELSON:  So we have three in the works right now.  Our next one is going to  be in Round Rock, Texas.  We have a site we're looking at in Massachusetts  and in Virginia.  And we're a privately held company.  It's my wife and I  and our five kids and so we're growing as quickly as we can.  But, you  know, just to get the money to do these -- they're very expensive.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well you talk about -- you say money.  What about the  availability of credit.  I'm assuming that you borrowed to build these  facilities.  What are the capital markets like right now for you?  </p><p> NELSON:  Well, we have the most unusual model you have ever seen.  We build  small community banks so our Pennsylvania projects we have 65 small  community banks, most of those from Wisconsin, I think about seven from  Pennsylvania, our tiny little hometown back in Wisconsin Dells and this big  consortium of banks.  And it is relatively easy.  They require us to put a  lot of money down so what we do is we save and we build and then save again  and build again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because that's a segment of the market that,  you know, lawmakers have been saying they are not lending enough to small  banks and they're trying to loosen things up so it probably becomes even  better an environment for you.  </p><p> NELSON:  It's a wonderful environment and especially because they're small  community banks so they don't have all of the red tape that some of the  larger banks do.  You can pick up the phone and call the president of the  bank they take your call and they're happy to do business with you.  It is  a wonderful model.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> What do people want now when they're traveling?  I mean I know technology  has really added lots of different choices but what do people, families  whether it's on the convention side of things or the waterslide side of  things -- what are they looking for that is different?  </p><p> NELSON:  They're looking to be entertained for the entire time they're with  us.  Our average stay is only 1.9 days so they're there for 40 hours.  And  so we need to keep them busy the entire time.  So we are building indoor  theme parks with ferris wheels, ropes course, miniature golf, go karts,  really food and beverage options -- that is very, very important.</p><p> We're just getting into the virtual reality right now at all three of our  locations -- that is been very popular.  So just, they want to be  constantly kept busy and moving.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Virtual reality.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to know how you're innovating in terms of the actual  slides and the water features that you put in these parks.  I'm a water  park junkie and have been since I was little and I still go.  And so I want  to know, like how are you innovating?   Or is it just kind of an expansion  of what we have been seeing the last 20 years or so?  </p><p> NELSON:  It's really whatever we can dream up, they can build.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Really.</p><p> NELSON:  Yes.  And it's incredible -- I just got back two days ago.  My son  and I -- we went over to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kazakhstan (ph) and  Kuwait.  And we were looking at indoor theme parks.  They have the best  indoor theme parks in the world over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do they, really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  Oh absolutely.  Just tremendous stuff.  And we learned so much.   So we traveled.  Most of the waterslide companies are in Canada so we go  and visit them frequently and we talk about what we can do.  Uphill  waterslides are getting very popular.</p><p> It's a great business.  We get to dream and play and have fun.  And now we  just have -- we have nine grandchildren now, my wife and I do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How great.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  My goodness.</p><p> NELSON:  And so we have created the coolest little areas for one to five- year-olds.  They're just spectacular.  So water tables and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They want to go and hang out with Grandpa Todd and all his fun  toys.  </p><p> NELSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I tell the four other grandpas, I say, you know,  you don't have a chance.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, they don't.  You're right they don't have a chance to  compete.  </p><p> NELSON:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's great.  So you learn some good stuff in Dubai and the  rest of them -- Dubai has a lot of indoor attractions, right.  </p><p> NELSON:  Yes, they do.  It's very hot over there.  It's 120 degrees when we  were over there.  And so we saw everything from a $2 million indoor theme  park to a billion-dollar indoor them park and it was life lessons really  well learned and so we'll take that all down to Texas and Pennsylvania and  around.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we look forward to that.  I know the Poconos properties  are real hot right now as well.  </p><p> NELSON:  It's smoking hot.  We love that East Coast market too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Smoking hot -- we'll take it.</p><p> Todd -- great to see you.</p><p> NELSON:  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the developments -- Todd  Nelson joining us.</p><p> Coming up re-chilling relations with Cuba.  President Trump is bringing  back harsher restrictions on Havana.  What it means for U.S. businesses in  the country.</p><p> Plus lots of investors saying cut me some slack after the upstart chat  company's $9 billion valuation -- why Amazon is reportedly interested in  acquiring the company before Wall Street can get its hands on it.  We'll  check it out.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from the U.S. Open at Erin Hills Golf Course in  Wisconsin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Friday, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, June 16th.  Here are  your top stories 7:30 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p> President Trump takes on Cuba.  The commander in chief set to unveil a new  policy toward the island nation.  Fox News is confirming that the action  will include strict enforcement of travel exemptions between the U.S. and  Cuba.  What it means for businesses investing in the country, coming up.</p><p> DuPont's merger with Dow Chemical has gotten approval, but with conditions.   What U.S. antitrust enforcers need to see from the future chemical giants?</p><p> And Amazon may have a message for Slack money.  Why the retail giant have  reportedly be looking to acquire the messaging service.  </p><p> And brewing big business in Wisconsin.  The president of Leinenkugel  brewing joins us on how his company was able to find major success in the  state.</p><p> Futures showing markets will open higher this morning.  Take a look at  Futures indicating a gain of about 20 points on the Dow Jones industrial  average.  About 10 points on the NASDAQ.  A firmer start to the markets  this morning.</p><p> In Europe, stocks are higher as well, across the board in fact.  Take a  look at the Eurozone indices and we see the FTSE 100 up two thirds of a  percent.  As is the CAC quarante in Paris and the DAX index in Germany, up  a quarter of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close in Asia.  As you see,  best performer was Japan, up just one half of one percent.  Hang Seng up a  quarter of a percent.</p><p> Another milestone for the final frontier.  A Russian ship set to dock with  the international space station later this hour.  The incredible images  coming up this morning.</p><p> First though our top story this half an hour.  President Trump is set to  unveil a new Cuba policy directive today in Miami.  Fox News can now  confirm it will include strict enforcement of travel exemptions between the  U.S. and Cuba.  Commerce between American companies and Cuban businesses  owned by its military and intelligence services would also reportedly be  prohibited.</p><p> The state department will also create a special taskforce to help expand  internet access for Cubans.  President Trump is reportedly expected to call  for the release of Cuban political prisoners.</p><p> Joining us right now to weigh on is the co-host of The Five, Juan Williams.   Juan, good to see you.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you make of these changes to the Obama era policy  really?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  The art of the deal, Maria.  The art of the deal.  I think that  what we're seeing from President Trump is an attempt to put Cuba back on  their heels and say, this is not going to be so easy to get the resumption  of some kind of relationship with the U.S.  And in order to accelerate that  relationship, you're going to have to make some accommodation, I think  especially in terms of press freedoms.  Treatments of people who are  political opponents of the Castro regime.</p><p> They want to see that before they're willing to allow the U.S., for  example, to travel that you spoke about.  The U.S. citizens to travel  easily to Cuba to infuse money into the Cuban economy.</p><p> CORTES:  Juan, Steve Cortes here.  To look at the political angle to this  during the campaign, of course, we all heard that Florida was going to be  the toss-up state.  It turns out it wasn't all that hard for Trump to win.   One of the reasons is he did exceedingly well among Cuban-American voters  in south Florida.  So, do you think this is important politically as a  promised kept to those Cuban voters who supported him?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Wow, that's a tough one.  I'll tell you why it's a tough one.   Yes.  He won in that Cuban community and again was a surprise to many  people given some of the comments he had about immigrants.  But not a  surprise among older Cubans who really have retain that anger at what  happened way back with the Castro, with Fidel Castro, in particular.</p><p> So the question is about younger Cubans who would really think the policy  that we had in place for 50 plus years did not lead to the erosion of the  communist state in their country.  It didn't improve conditions for people  living in Cuba.  Maybe this was a different step in terms of what the Obama  administration try to put in place.</p><p> But I think in terms of that older generation, you're exactly right.  I  think they would see this is a promise kept.  I'm not sure that President  Trump going to be faired to him, is going all the way back.  So we'll see  how this works out.</p><p> I do think it's about the deal making and about getting the new Castro,  Fidel's brother, Raul, to say I'm going to come to the table and try to  give you some of what you're seeking in terms of more democratic attitudes  and more economic freedoms that's especially important for American  businesses.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And in terms of American businesses, Juan, it's not that much of  a hardship that Trump does this.  We've seen a lot of the airlines, for  example, reducing and cutting the flights to keep up because the demand  from American tourist just has not materialized.  Not in the way that they  expected.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  That's right.  But I think that what you're hoping to see is in  fact that as American business goes in there, as they develop the resorts  potentially casinos and the like, I mean, that's what Cuba was famous for  in the day.  Dagen, you're still young.  But I think that's what they were  hoping for.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I have a collection of glasses and trinkets from those old  casinos before the revolution because you can buy them from people who fled  to Miami from Cuba.  So you can preach but I know what you're talking  about.  And I'm older than you think.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  Anyway, but I mean, when you start to  think about the potential there for tourism, I think it's a pretty much  very strong everything from the cigars to the rum and the like and just the  life.  So I think that's what American business was hoping for.  In fact,  at one point President Trump was hoping to develop some resorts, golf  courses in Cuba while he was in the private business.</p><p> So I think that's still there.  But you're right, the immediate kind of  tourism that the bump that the airlines was expecting has not materialized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about immigration in general.  The Trump  administration is scrapping another Obama era policy.  This one protecting  undocumented parents.  The administration says it's going to and the  deferred deportation fund of undocumented parents of children who are  American citizens or legal residents.  The decision does not affect another  Obama era program for children brought to the U.S. illegally.  What's your  reaction?</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Well, that's a tough one.  I think again, you could put it under  the rubric of promises kept, in terms of cracking down on immigration.  But  wow, I think this hurts families, so I think you're going to get a lot of  kickback on this.  I don't think it helps him with the immigrant community  or with people who are looking for him to make a special exception for  those DACA children that you just described.  Children who were maybe  brought here as young people potentially against their will and who have  grown up here.  Have totally American identity.  When you start to break up  families, I do think it plays into the hand of the critics.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Juan, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching what  takes place this weekend.  Juan Williams joining us in New York.  Good to  see you, sir.</p><p> WILLIAMS:  Enjoy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a mega merger scores antitrust -- a mega merger  scores antitrust approval, but there's a catch.  The condition is in place  for the multi- billion-dollar Dow-DuPont deal.</p><p> Plus, brewing up big bucks of Wisconsin.  I'll sit down with the president  of Leinenkugel Brewing to talk about the beer maker's explosive growth in  recent years.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin for the 117t U.S. Open.  Tee offs  beginning momentarily, actually.</p><p> We are watching the technology sector this morning.  Amazon reportedly  eying an acquisition.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange with details.  Nicole, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, we're looking  at Slack.  This is a chat room company and they'd been raising money and  raising interest among many companies including Amazon.  Will Amazon step  up and pay $9 billion for Slack?  This is a chat room type company.  You  could see Amazon stock 968.94 is up about a half of one percent.  It could  go for about $9 billion.</p><p> Recode also noting that some of the others are interested.  Microsoft,  Salesforce, Google.  And the analysts are saying that this -- if they were  to get Slack would really give Amazon a collaboration with the coworkers so  that they can chat among the coworkers around the globe and give them the  edge.  So we'll see whether or not that happens.</p><p> Then we're moving on to Dow and DuPont.  So that move is toward to win the  U.S. antitrust approval with some conditions.  That's the catch.  Because  there are some conditions here in order to make it go through.  The  companies have to agree now to sell, crop protection products as well as  some of the other assets.  And by doing that, that would then prevent hikes  or other things in the industry that people don't want to see.  And also  keep innovation alive.  So we're going to watch for that.</p><p> I will also note that while they got U.S. approval -- for the antitrust  approval, they still have to get some approval in Canada and Mexico but  have done so far in Europe and China.</p><p> And it just joins the whole farming industry.  There's Dow and DuPont,  buyer in Monsanto, ChemChina and Syngenta and part I should -- that maybe  planning a merger.  So things are in the works in this particular industry.   Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch that, Nicole.  Thanks so much.   Nicole Petallides on Wall Street.</p><p> Let's talk about this Dow-DuPont merger and we may or may not see.  They're  going to have to make some confessions, Steve.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  By the way too also, I think good news in general that I  think mergers are generally strong and heating up.  That's generally a good  sign for the stock market, good sign for the economy at large.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is going to be a behemoth company.  And we were waiting  for what the antitrust folks would say about it.</p><p> CORTES:  Well, you're right.  This is so big.  This is a unique merger in  that regard and there's so many policy implications and there's going to be  so much government oversight of it.  And I'm not smart enough lawyer to  know where that shakes out at the end and what they have to sell off or  what business they have to get out of.</p><p> But I think what's important as an investor is just to know that mergers  are strong in the M&amp;A business, Mergers and Acquisitions are strong.  I  think that's a good sign of optimism for the future.  If we get this tax  package done, which I believe we're going to, I think we are going to see  both the real economy and the stock market soar for the rest of 2017 and in  2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does this also speak to a friendlier administration and a  friendlier FTC in relation to approving these kinds of mergers?</p><p> CORTES:  Dagen, that's a great point.  Because they may not even try this,  right?  Let's say Hillary Clinton won and I say this is just a nonstarter.   Let's not even go down that road.  So I think we certainly have an  administration in the White House right now who is business friendly, who  knows that if we need employment -- if we're going to have employment,  really accelerate, not the kind of tepid employment gains that we've seen  lately.  We have to be pro-employer.</p><p> And part of that is the regulatory framework, the regulatory burden on  American business, both large and small has been onerous, far too heavy,  far too heavy-handed.  And I think once we unleash -- I really view the  American economy right now like a runner that's doing it's best to run, but  we're in a way to invest.  Once we think that way and vest off, I think  this economy is going to just soar.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about what we're seeing in markets.  I spoke to  really who I think is one of the smartest guys out there on Wall Street.   He just said, it's going to be hard for the market to get another leg up  significantly higher without the same stocks.  That is Facebook, Amazon,  Google, Alphabet the tech stocks that have been on fire.  And are we going  to see this market wait to see them stabilized?  Because they've been  really rolling over certainly.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.  No, Maria.  Listen, I certainly hear that.  I think though  the roll over recently.  We need to put in context in a context of the  rally they had since the election that the roll over isn't that  significant.  Now, you bought these stocks couple weeks ago, you're having  a tough time.  If you bought it last summer, you're still doing fabulous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But maybe we're seeing a rotation.  It's a financials into  elsewhere.</p><p> CORTES:  In energy, I think.  Personally.  I think those two --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Give tech a break.</p><p> CORTES:  Those two places.  Exactly.  Tech has been -- and one of the  things that have worried me about the rally.  I'm constructive on the stock  market.  But one thing that has worried me is it's been a little too narrow  for my liking.  A few tech names have really dominated the rally.  I think  it would actually be healthier for the overall market and frankly for the  economy, if we saw a broader rally.  If we involve financials and energy.   I believe energy is going to get better from here.  So to me, it's not so  much market direction as it is.  Rotation, I think will be the game.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one positive sign at least this week is you have the NASDAQ  as poised to decline for the week.  Also the Russell 2000 and small  companies.  But the transports are up.  Of the five kind of major market  gauges including the Dow and the S&amp;P, that one is up more than any other.   It's almost up 0.9 percent.  That's not a huge gain.  But again, it's  always very often a sign of an economy that looks OK.  If people are  betting on the transport.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When the industrials and the transport move together for sure.</p><p> Let me ask you.  You mentioned tax reform.  We talk about this every  morning.  And we're waiting.  We know the markets are waiting.  Do you  still think they can get this done?  What do we have?  Twenty days, twenty- five days?  In terms of when these guys are in office.</p><p> CORTES:  I don't want to sound like Pollyanna.  Okay.  But I do believe  we're going to get enough.  Having said that, I will also say the congress  should not go on recess until this gets done.  And I firmly believe that  and I hope the people, I hope there's an uproar from the American people  telling congress.  They take all of August off.  All of it.</p><p> I mean, what Americans takes all August off?  I sure don't, you don't.  The  congress shouldn't.  Unless they things done first which is the two primary  ones are tax reform and health care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think healthcare is going to have an imminently.  And if they  get health care done imminently, they actually do have a shot to get tax  reform done.</p><p> CORTES:  I remain convinced that we're going to get it done.  When I talk  to my friends in the Trump campaign, many of whom are now in the White  House.  They tell me, a lot is going on behind the scenes.  While the  mainstream media is focused on ridiculous Russia allegations and while the  democrats are focused on made-up stories of collusion, there's a lot going  on between the White House and Hill republicans in terms of serious  negotiations to get this done.</p><p> And by the way, if we do, I think all the rest of that becomes just noise.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But there are a lot of republican senators who are already  talking about not getting on board with the republican health care bill  coming out of the senate.  Lisa Murkowski, Mike Lee, Rand Paul.  The list  continuous to grow.  And it's a very narrow margin of victory in the senate  for that.</p><p> CORTES:  No, it's not going to be easy.  And I'll say this too.  If we  don't get it done, I think we're going to be in a lot of trouble in 2018.   And we will deserve those problems in 2018.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why I think they're going to get it done.  Come hell  or high water.  We'll see.</p><p> Still ahead, bottling up success.  How Wisconsin's Leinenkugel Brewing  Company turned the craft beer trend into big bucks for the home state?   Back in a moment.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Erin Hills in the U.S. Open.  Nothing says  Wisconsin like beer and Leinenkugel has been brewing in the Badger State  for 150 years.  Joining us right now is Dick Leinenkugel, president of the  Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company.  Dick, that's quite a milestone.   Congratulations to you.</p><p> DICK LEINENKUGEL, PRESIDENT, JACOB LEINENKUGEL BREWING COMPANY:  Well,  we're really humbled and I'm humbled to be in the chair guiding our company  now in its sixth generation of 150 years of brewing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do that?  Do you look to change in terms of growth  or do you try to keep it as it was from the beginning?  How do you lead a  company that's 150 years old?  You want to keep some things, I guess the  way they are.  I know it always has been but you just want to grow  differently.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  I think you grow up in the business.  Being part of the  family.  Our great-great-grandfather started brewing beer in 1867 in  Chippewa Falls for the thirsty lumberjacks that were milling the way  playing lumber to build the great city of Chicago.</p><p> So it's now through five generations.  The government tried to put us out  of business in 1918 but we survived that by making soda pop.  Came out of  probation, the third generation, fourth generation.  My father led the  company for over 40 years.  My brother for 25 years and now I'm in the  chair and we have just a great team of employees in Chippewa Falls,  Wisconsin and the world's best brew master's.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What a proud history.  Terrific.</p><p> CORTES:  So 30 years ago, I guess the business was sold, is that correct?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  So my dad and his cousins have both decided to join up  with Miller Brewing Company at the time.  A well-respected Wisconsin  Brewer, 30 years ago.  So, yes.</p><p> CORTES:  Tell me though.  But it sounds like still a lot of autonomy.  I  mean, it sounds like Leinenkugel is still truly its own businesses within  this very large organization most of all.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  And I think that's really why we've been able to thrive is  that the family has guided the business.  But using the resources of Miller  Brewing Company, the MillerCoors now.  Part of the MillerCoors global  network.  So it's really something that we've been able to maintain that  autonomy, our own brewing in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.  Been able to grow  the business with their help.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Talk about beer innovations.  Again, I actually, off-camera,  tasted the summer shandy and I can say that it's 6:40 in the morning, It's  a delicious breakfast beer.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  It's absolutely fabulous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think 5:00 somewhere.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I did 5:00 A.M.  I didn't drink one of the hot beers.  I didn't  have the whole thing.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  SO summer shandy is available on the course here at Erin  Hills.  And what a refreshing beer.  So it's beer mixed with lemonade.  And  we were the first to bring this down to the United States back in 2007.   And we've been growing the business ever since.  And now in five months, we  brew more summer shandy than all of our other beers combined.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds incredible with lemonade.  You're also celebrating  the anniversary with a special beer.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  We are.  So we collaborated with Hofbrau.  So think of this.   A German brewery with 400 years of brewing experience.  Our brewery with  150 years of brewing experience collaborated on a special German Marzen  style beer to celebrate our 150th anniversary.  So it's a fabulous beer.   It's just available now in six packs starting on draft.  And it's going to  be just a wonderful beer to celebrate our 150 years of brewing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  What are your plans in terms of further expansion?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Well, we're expanding our brewery in Milwaukee to add more  brewing capacity and more brewing capability and we certainly want to  continue to grow.  First and foremost, we're all about delighting our beer  drinkers and I think by delighting our beer drinkers, that's how we  continue to grow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Can you go through -- I mean, beer versus Ale.  When  you have more wheat in one.  Give us the different ales if you will in  terms of the beer category.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  So there's two kinds of beer.  And you're saying, well, what  do you mean?  There's 500, 1,000 different kinds of IPAs.  No.  There's  only two kinds of beer.  There's lagers and there are ales.  And it all has  to do about the yeast strain.  So lagers are coal fermented.  And for a  longer period of time, ales are used with a different fermentation and  they're a little bit more at a quicker period of time.  They're a little  bit more fruity and estuary where ales are -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And are they lighter?  Is an ale lighter?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Ale is no.  Not necessarily.  It all depends on the style  within the lager or the ales.  But there's really only two kinds of beer.   So think of it that way.  And it all has to do with the yeast strain.  But  there's a lot of innovation in the beer market today.  We do mostly lager- style beers which are aged, cold-stored for a little bit smoother flavor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Thank you for that.  Real quick on Trump's policies.   Do you feel like tax reform is going to make a big difference in terms of  growth strategy?</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  You know that we're a heavily taxed industry right now and  have been for many years.  But I think that the best thing that I can  continue to do is to brew great beer that are beer drinkers are going to  choose.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dick, great to have you on the show today.</p><p> LEINENKUGEL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.

Thank you so much for joining us  here in Erin Hills in Wisconsin, it is Friday, June 16th.  Your top stories  right now, 8:00 am on the East Coast.  With the breaking news this morning,  the leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The associated press reporting that  Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an air strike in  Syria about a month ago.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot confirm  this news.</p><p> We are waiting on more confirmation.  We are looking at what it means for  the war on terrorism straight ahead.  A show of unity at the congressional  baseball game last night, both teams coming together for a prayer for their  colleague Congressman Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.  And  President Trump praised lawmakers in a video message right before the game.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In Washington, we have our  disagreements.  But we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we  love.  And the people who call it home.  That's the source of unity and  more than ever we must embrace it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the unity we short-lived unfortunately House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi already back at it attacking Republicans this morning,  blaming Republicans for the (INAUDIBLE) in politics.  What she said coming  up.  President Trump on defensive this morning.  He just tweeted on the  Russia investigation saying this, quote, After 7 months of investigations  and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\" nobody has been  able to show any proof.  Sad!  We'll have more on that coming up as  president tweets about Russia.  And health care battle rages on Capitol  Hill.  Why conservatives are growing concerned about the state of the  senate's bill.</p><p> Billions in liabilities on faulty airbags could bring down Takata.  The  company behind the biggest auto recall in U.S. history may be preparing for  bankruptcy now.  The details next.  And the drama over Bernie Madoff not  going away.  New scrutiny this morning over the compensation fund for his  victims and why it hasn't been paid out yet.  Futures are indicating a gain  at the opening of trading this morning.  Take a look at markets futures  indicating gain of about 15 points on the Dow, five points on NASDAQ, the  market is off from the best levels of the morning right now.</p><p> In Europe, stocks are still higher.  Take a look at the Eurozone indices  here.  And you see the FT 100 and the CAC quarante up about two-thirds of  one percent and the DAX Index in German up a quarter of a percent.  Markets  in Asia overnight finished mixed.  As you'll see here best performer was  Japan of 1/2 of one percent.  And it is day two of U.S. Open, it is getting  under way.  Will Rickie Fowler follow his day one success?  We've got a  recap of yesterday's action, everything you need to know as golfer's tee up  right now, all of those stories coming up this morning and joining me to  talk all about it Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, BGC partner senior  strategist, and Fox News contributor, Steve Cortes.  Great day.  Great to  be here.  </p><p> STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's so gorgeous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love the white Wisconsin flavor that you get out here.  Dick  Leinenkugel talking about you can be drinking summer (INAUDIBLE) as you  watch all this fantastic (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p> CORTES:  The first U.S. Open ever in Wisconsin.  I would think the first of  many given the hospitality so far.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  We got a big show ahead.  We've got this  breaking news that we're following, that the head of ISIS has been killed.   Joining the conversation, Texas Congressman, Brian Babin is with us, the  CEO of Harley-Davidson is here, Matt Levatich, PGA Tour Superstore  President, and CEO, Dick Sullivan is here, and the host of Varney and Co.,  Stuart Varney also will weigh in.  Big hour ahead you don't want to miss a  moment of it.</p><p> First off, breaking news President Trump just tweeted this, and he is  talking about the Russia probe this morning, \"After seven months of  investigations and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\"  nobody has been able to show any proof.  Sad!\"  says the president.  Adam  Shapiro was live at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam,  good morning to you.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS:  And good morning to you, Maria.  The  administration points out as well, that it was James Comey who told the  president three times, that he was not a part of the investigation  regarding Russia and then just late last night, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy  attorney general put out a statement, an official DOJ statement saying that  Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories  attributed to anonymous officials.</p><p> So the administration is standing up for the president and fighting back on  some of these stories but the other news that is gaining attention here at  the White House, this morning, has to do with what you were reporting about  Russia's claim that they killed that ISIS leader and his name Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, they say was killed on May 28 during a Russian attack on a  meeting of ISIS leaders in Raqqa, Syria.  Now, they say that this took  place during the meeting and that they also killed 30 mid-level militant  leaders and about 300 fighters, the U.S. military cannot confirm that al- Baghdadi was actually killed and there have been reports over years that he  was killed but if it is true, official say this would be a big blow to ISIS  which is on the run in both Iraq and Syria.</p><p> The other headlines which are grabbing attention at the White House have to  do with vote in the Senate yesterday, in which the senate voted 97 to two  to approve new sanctions against Russia.  Very simply these sanctions would  be against Russia's mining and minerals sector as well as energy sector.   It would have consequences for countries in Europe like Germany because it  would go after companies which invest in Russian organizations.</p><p> Now, there was a statement by Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary who  said and this is a quote, \"The administration is committed to existing  sanctions against Russia and will keep them in place until Moscow fully  honors its commitment to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.\"  \"We believe the  existing executive branch sanctions regime is the best tool for compelling  Russia to fulfill its commitments.\"  The Senate enacted these sanctions,  although, they're not official just yet as retribution for Russia's  interferences with the 2016 elections and of course its annexation of  Crimea.  This still needs to be voted upon in the House and then get  President Trump's signature.  It's a long road ahead if these sanctions are  to become law.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam, we'll be watching that.  Thank you so much.   Adam Shapiro with the latest there, he's at the White House.  Meanwhile, a  show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  coming together for a prayer for their colleague.  Congressman Steve  Scalise ahead of the first pitch last night.  Here is what Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi had to say on her weekly news conference yesterday just before  the baseball game.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  When the president says  \"I can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care\", when you have  somebody say \"beat them up and I'll pay their legal fees\", when you have  all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so  sanctimonious is something that I really am almost sad that I had to go  down this path with you because I don't think it's appropriate for us to  have the fullest discussion of it.  It will be for another day.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, there goes the unity that was short lived.  Joining us  right now is Texas Republican Congressman, Brian Babin.  Congressman, your  reaction to Nancy Pelosi's comments there.</p><p> REP. BRIAN BABIN, (R) TEXAS:  I am not surprised, Maria, not surprised  whatsoever.  I listened to her 20-minute-long speech on the floor the other  day and I could only hope that that was sincere but when you look at the --  for instance to some of her commencement speeches to graduating college  seniors over the past few months has been divide, divide, divide, you know,  and I'm not just blaming her, it's the left in general.  They lost the  election.</p><p> They're demonizing us in our policies, they can demonize our policies but  don't demonize us and that's kind of what ginned up this whole thing and  again, the oil needs to be poured on the waters but it's got to be from  both sides, and as we saw, calling us sanctimonious after one of our  leaders was shot on a baseball field for a charity game, it is pretty low.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But what are you going to do about it though?  I mean, you guys  have to get it an agenda executed.  I mean, let's talk health care reform  for a second, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that some Republicans  are also pushing back in terms of getting a health care reform done so it's  not just the division between the Republicans and the Democrats but  division between the Republicans, are you concerned over the senate's new  bill to replace Obamacare?  We're all wondering where it is, what it says.   Critics are saying that the plan doesn't do enough to reduce health care  premiums and you need democratic support and you're not getting it because  of this division.</p><p> BABIN:  Well we're never going to get Democratic support on this, Maria,  there's just no way.  They're determined to, you know -- to stick with a --  with a ship that sinking Obamacare.  But yes, I am concerned that we may  get a bill but it's going to take a lot of rehashing.  We will have to go  to conference on this thing.  We've got to get these premiums down, we've  got to do this thing right, you -- I was a no initially on the original  proposal in the house, I did get some great concessions to me from --  personally from the president, a personal phone call which got me to a yes  and we held out and we got a bill, we got one through, and now, it's up to  the Senate.</p><p> I'm talking to some of my Texas Senate colleagues and they're confident we  are going to get a bill out, what's going to be in it, I have no clue but  we better get it right and we better get it -- get these premiums down, and  we absolutely have to replace this spiraling downward Obamacare plan which  is not going to be with us a whole lot longer.</p><p> CORTES:  Congressman, Steve Cortes here, you know, over the -- until Labor  Day, so, you know, roughly 10 weeks or so, I think the Congress is only  going to be working 22 days or so, something like that, most Americans are  working a hack of lot more than that.  If you don't get tax reform done if  you don't get tax cuts done should the Congress stay in session and not  take its August recess?</p><p> BABIN:  I am in favor of that a one hundred percent.  If we can be useful  up here, if we can vote on some things that absolutely need to be done,  again, the Trump and the Republican conservative agenda has to be delivered  to the American people, that is why we were elected, that's why we won the  presidency --</p><p> CORTES:  And that, Congressman --</p><p> BABIN:  -- and if we don't get it done I think there's going to be a hell  to pay in the 2018 of the midterm elections, so we've got to get this done,  we need tax reform, regulatory reform and we've got to get past health care  reform and repeal and replace Obamacare first.  Absolutely.  You are right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, how is -- it's Dagen McDowell, how is it that some  of your colleagues over on the Senate side are making -- seeming to make  the same mistake that the Democrats did in terms of their crafting this  bill behind closed doors and a lot of fellow Republicans senators have not  seen it and they don't know what's in it and you guys over in the house  certainly don't at this point.</p><p> BABIN:  We have no clue.  As I said a while ago I don't know what if we're  going to wind up saying but -- I mean, I am apprehensive about that, Dagen.   I think it needs to be an open process, I think had it been a more open  process in the house it wouldn't have been a two month dragged out deal the  way it was.  And so I wish that they would look and profit from the  mistakes that we made over in the house, but we did it and we got our job  done, it wasn't a perfect bill.</p><p> I think it was absolutely more conservative at the time that I got to a yes  rather than later as we waited for several weeks, even a month or two.  It  became a less conservative bill in my opinion but nevertheless, I voted for  it.  We -- that was the promise we made for the American people to repeal  this terrible bill, which is destroying the health care industry in our  country.  And as a -- as a -- as a --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How can you teach --</p><p> BABIN:  As a health care provider myself I can tell you that Obamacare was  absolutely destroying the doctor-patient relationship.  And our bill would  replace that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Congressman, you keep saying, \"We've got to get  this done, we've got to get this done,\" but realistically speaking, do you  see that path?  I mean, you've got to get health care done really quickly,  so I assume you'll accept whatever the Senate comes up with, but do you  think you can get health care on a very short term timeline and then come  back from the summer and do tax reform, is that what you're saying?  I  mean, what is the path?  Because as Steve just said you've got 22 days.</p><p> BABIN:  You're exactly right, Maria and, you know, I can't -- I can't say  or even predict what we are going to get and I can't tell you that I'm  going to support whatever comes out of the Senate.  We're going to have to  make sure that it is something that'll put the average Americans back in  the saddle in controlling their own health care policies and get these  premiums deductibles down so that we will -- we will go back to conference  on -- depending on what they finally wind up passing.</p><p> But I will tell you this, if the Senate would dispense with this 60-vote  rule, the filibuster rule we would get a whale of a lot of our agenda  accomplished but being dependent on getting eight Democrats to vote with us  on every issue that comes right to the Senate, well, the thing about it  that gives a veto power to Nancy Pelosi and to Chuck Schumer and it really  shouldn't happen.  We won't have Judge Gorsuch right now had we not done  so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman, good to have you on the program.   We'll be watching.  Thank you so much.</p><p> BABIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Brian Babin.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Shares of Takata has been suspended in Tokyo.   Ahead of expected bankruptcy filing.  Lauren Simonetti with the details in  New York.  Lauren.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FIELD PRODUCER:  Certainly a story  that we're watching, Maria.  Takata facing billions of dollars in  liabilities after its defective airbags led to the biggest safety recall in  automotive history linked to at least a dozen debts and over one hundred  injuries worldwide.  Takata had said to be in talks about a potential deal  with a key -- with key safety systems that the U.S. auto parts maker.   Well, there's growing criticism in how the Bernie Madoff compensation fund  is being handled.</p><p> The Justice Department settlement fund has four billion dollars year marked  for the victims but no one has been paid a cent since the fund was created  four years ago.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a  congressional panel this week he will look into why it has taken so long  for money to reach thousands of investors who took losses in Madoff's Ponzi  scheme.  Well, guess this, Illinois will no longer sell tickets for Mega  Millions or Powerball after June 30th if there is no state budget.</p><p>Illinois lawmakers have been unable to pass the budget for more than two  years now.  The governor has called a special session of legislature to  come up with a budget deal but a lot of spokesperson said, Powerball would  be suspended after the June 28th drawing and Mega Millions after the June  30th drawing if a budget deal is not reached.  And this I'm not making up,  many Americans think we live in a Willy Wonka world survey a real survey  commissioned by the National Dairy Council, seven percent of us believe  chocolate milk comes from chocolate colored cows.</p><p> That appears like a small number but it amounts to 16 or 17 million  citizens.  Forty-eight percent of adults surveyed admitted to not being  sure of where chocolate milk comes from.  The refrigerator, Maria comes  from the refrigerator.  I mean, really?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  See you later.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go figure.  Thanks, Lauren.  Coming up, when it comes to made  in America, Harley-Davidson is at the front of the pack.  We'll talk to the  CEO of the motorcycle giant about how they're embracing President Trump's  American made initiatives and then the biggest names in golf teeing off at  the U.S. Open this morning.  Who is at top of the standings after an  exciting start for the tournament, we'll bring it to you next live from  Erin Hills.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills for the 117th U.S. Open this morning here in  Wisconsin.  The second round of the U.S. Open tees off in minutes.  Jared  Max joining is joining us now for a look at what happened yesterday.   Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  U.S. Open  traditionally humbling to golf scorers even for the best players in the  world but yesterday 29 players shot under par, in fact, 17 recorded scores  of 3 under or better.  Nobody was better than 28-year-old Californian  Rickie Fowler.  Fowler has never won a major tournament but he has a one- shot lead entering today's second round.  He hit the string of three  straight birdies yesterday, seven birdies, and all no bogeys finished 7  under and that's tied for lowest score in relation to par ever in the first  round at the U.S. Open.</p><p> Rough day for defending champion, Dustin Johnson, the emphasis on rough,  fescue shot.  A 75, 3 over tied for 102nd.  Jordan Spieth didn't have  banner first round either, he struggled on the greens.  Finished at 1 over  and Jason Day, tough day as well.  Close encounter with the fescue at Erin  Hills.  He tripled bogeyed, the fourth hole and finished at 7 over par.  So  let's take a look at how the leaderboard shapes up now as round two just  getting under way.</p><p> Rickie Fowler your leader by one over Paul Casey, and American Xander  Schauffele, also Jordan Spieth, you see that plus one Dustin Johnson at 3  over and Rory McIlroy plus 6, not so easy to hit those fair waze, is it,  Rory?  Time for baseball highlights and not home runs images but rather  images of stellar defense yesterday who made a more spectacular catch  Thursday.  Trevor Story of the Colorado Rockies or Didi Gregorius of the  New York Yankees.</p><p> Let's start with Trevor Story.  Colorado was up, 3-1 on San Francisco,  Denard Span pops it up, watch Trevor Story here, beautiful catch, diving to  make the grab.  Trevor Story comes up with the help of Rockies win the game  10-9.  They lead the NL West by one game.  Nice grab.  Meanwhile, the New  York Yankees' Didi Gregorius last night with an amazing catch for Didi  Gregorius looked somewhat like Willie Mays.  I mean, catch better won goes  to Willie Mays, it goes to Didi Gregorious.</p><p> It looks like we don't have that.  And the Golden State following their  second NBA Championship the last three seasons, the Warriors parted ways  parting with their fans yesterday during a parade and rally in downtown  Oakland.  Draymond Green of the Warriors had fun of the Cavaliers' expense  that, you know, the Cavaliers play at Quicken Loans Arena.  They call it  The Q, well, they got to see their finals opponent take a shot at how short  the series was.  Draymond Green wore a T-shirt with a big Q, only said  quickie since the Warriors won a quickie in five games.  Green also took a  shot at LeBron James because LeBron, remember, ditched Cleveland for Miami,  well, and what about super teams.  Listen to what he said yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DRAYMOND GREEN, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS:  I don't want to talk about super  teams this, super team that.  I never played on a super team, you started  the super team, bro.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  And look at that, Maria.  A shot at LeBron James.  Remember, he left  Cleveland, was criticized because he went to Miami and said, \"Hey, I can't  win a championship without these superstars and now, I got superstars and  now, they're criticizing the Warriors for doing the same thing.  Maria, I  do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They have it scripted.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, incredible.  You know what, Jared, great stuff.  We're  actually all focused right now on what we have on set, we have the U.S.  Open Championship trophy right here and it's absolutely spectacular.  I  mean, this is -- Dagen, let's talk about it.  It's all sterling silver?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it's pure sterling silver.  It weighs eight and a half  pounds.  This trophy dates back to 1947.  The original trophy was lost in a  clubhouse fire the year prior to that, so in '46, the trophy was lost in a  fire, so this one goes back to 1947, and you look at the names and just  look at the names that are engraved on the side of it, 65 Gary Player.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of the names are engraved.  It's absolutely -- and the back  here --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Billy Casper, '67, Jack Nicklaus.  If you look at the top five  golfers who've won the most U.S. Opens, Nicklaus is in the top five.  I  think that he is third.  They are no -- Tiger Woods I believe is fifth but  there are no golfers currently on the tour who ranked among golfers who won  the most U.S. Opens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, they don't keep this forever, right?  What's the -- what's  the scoop?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Keep it for a year.  They get to keep it for a year.  They do  get -- they do get a keepsake that they don't have to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CORTES:  They do get also one interesting trivia so it wouldn't be this one  but the previous one in 1898, I forget the guy's name but whoever won it  was apparently a very heavy drinker, they were worry that he would hack it  for drinking money, had to put it -- he had a cool story, he had to put on  a deposit to keep it for the year --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p> CORTES:  -- but they keep -- and also interesting, when you look at the  names on here, I don't know, the viewers probably can't see it but one  thing you certainly notice is a very few repeats, only two people have ever  won twice in a row and after DJ started yesterday it seems like probably  not going to happen again this year.  We're going to have a new winner, it  looks like.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and just think the way it's engraved, it's so beautiful.   I don't even want to touch it, it's so gorgeous.</p><p> CORTES:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, they told me I wasn't allowed to touch it --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, then I won't try to --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just -- because I break things, so I  have to keep my -- it has a restraining order against me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely beautiful.  Sterling silver, the trophy right  here and somebody's going to be walking home with that on this tournament  and keeping it a for a year.  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting,  here is what he say in this morning, \"The Fake News Media hates when I use  what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media.  Over 100 million  people I can go around them.\"  He is fired up this morning, Steve Cortes.</p><p> CORTES:  You know, listen, make tweeting great again.  It was -- I'm going  to defend the president on this.  I love that he tweets and even a lot of  people who like him and who support him say, \"Gosh, I wish he'd hold back  on the Twitter,\" I think this is so important that number one, he can  connect directly with the American people, there's no mediators anymore,  but I think the secondly, most of the mainstream media is so utterly  antagonistic toward the president and I frankly don't even think that's  really very debatable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CORTES:  And the amount of fake news that's put out about him, one just  recent example, Washington Post saying that Comey asked for more money and  then he was -- for the Russian investigation and that's why he was fired.   Completely false --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p> CORTES:  -- utterly, utterly false --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will --</p><p> CORTES:  -- so the president has to go directly to the people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's what he's doing.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, Kroger getting clobbered.  The grocery store giant shares of  plummeting this morning after putting lower profits.  How the company plans  to turn that around.

We've got all the gifts you want to know about.  We are live here in  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin, for the 117th U.S. Open, of course, one  of the staples of the state is Harley-Davidson the legendary motorcycle  brand was founded in Milwaukee Wisconsin back in 1903, I am sporting a hot  Harley jacket right now.  A wardrobe change as we welcome the CEO of  Harley- Davidson, Matthew Levatich joining us here, Matt great to see you  again.</p><p> MATTHEW LEVATICH, HARLEY-DAVIDSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Nice to see  you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, thank you very much.  So  you've been committed to creating jobs in America your name comes up a lot  with President Trump, characterize the jobs market for us what you're  seeing in terms of the broader economy. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well you know as you mentioned we've been here from the very  beginning 1903, our engine plant is still in Milwaukee and Milwaukee's got  a long and proud history of a lot of not only manufacturing with technology  and development, and so the skilled trades element of what we see in a  workforce is very important.  So far we're having great success with the  employment that we need, the broader economy I think for the company and  for, you know, the United States, for us, is a lot about our opportunities  to grow internationally.  So trade is very important and we're paying a lot  of attention to the trade policies and the trade opportunities that we have  particularly in Asia, which is the world largest motorcycle market are in  Asia, our biggest growth potential, is in Asia and so the trade barriers  trade tariffs are obviously top of mind as we look to pursue those goals. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to talk about that because when President Trump speaks  about trade he's come up with this idea of a reciprocal tax and I think  it's partly because of your story, because when you sell motorcycles in  India they charge you what a 100 percent or 90 percent?</p><p> LEVATICH:  One hundred percent tariff on a straight import. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A 100 percent tariff to India and you're charge to 90 percent  tariff in China.</p><p> LEVATICH:  Yes, and throughout that region actually the tariffs in the  entire tax structure add a significant amount of burden to the product  before it gets to retail, and that limits our ability to access and reach  those customers we have a lot of passion for Harley in the region, again  their big motorcycle markets their growing and we see opportunity but those  tax and trade barriers are significant for us, as a limitation to that  growth. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This has been one of the most important examples, that  President Trump has discussed your story, the fact that you're selling  motorcycles overseas and they're giving you this huge tariff and were not  putting those kinds of tariffs on their products when they're coming here.   So do you favor something like that, I mean how do you alleviate these 100  percent tariffs if China and India are not going to change their - </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well, you know, the whole trade environment can't be taken in  isolated cases and so it's a very complex issue clearly we are heavily  invested U.S. manufacturer we are exporting our products around the world  90 countries so a direct offset of imported motorcycles is not something  that's easily, sort of, simple, sort of, contained a solution, and you  know, in something like TPP was in negotiation for almost a decade before  it was unfortunately turned down, right?  That would have helped us a lot  we're optimistic the administration understands the issues that we face and  our working on our behalf of as well as on behalf of many here American  companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean isn't it interesting that the biggest markets for you  are in Asia, and this is where they are actually charging they know that  this is a big market for you and they are going to make sure you may up for  it. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Well, that's I guess one interpretation, it is what it is and  we're working every angle that we can, to open those markets, because the  customers are there, they are interested as those economies as disposable  income-leisure time expands, it's a right market for Harley-Davidson our  competitors are there oftentimes without the burdens that we have.  And we  need to find ways to access those markets. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well you are obviously an iconic brand, got a loyal following  all around the world.  Tell us about what you're seeing a lot of people  talking about the retail environment being under pressure we saw that from  retail sales we may have seen that even from your earnings I don't know if  that's what you saw.</p><p> LEVATICH:  You know, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market many  people are participating in the economy but they're participating in ways  that are I think easily kind of turned on and turned off their watching to  see sustained and significant momentum in the economy job security income  security those types of things.  So that sort of tempted in this, I think  affects companies like Harley, you know, we're selling a product that is an  aspiration product it's some people dream to have and if they don't have  that kind of security they might hold off and wait.  And I think that's,  that's an aspect of the economy that's still with us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you attract newer generations?</p><p> LEVATICH:  That's very important to us we are fundamentally about riding,  you know, when you look around the beautiful country sided here around Erin  Hills this is where the company was founded this is where I like to come  and ride beautiful rolling hills and scenic roads.  I think our founders  were doing the same thing at the very beginning, it is for us all about  riding, and creating and recreating the passion for motorcycling is really  core to our strategy for the next decade.  So it's not simple thing to do  but just reminding ourselves that we are in the business of riding and to  make sure that we have the full attention of not just we build motorcycles  but we build riders, because we have to invest in our sport and remind  people how awesome it is to be out riding a motorcycle. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did you ride your bike here today?</p><p> LEVATICH:  I did not because they would not let me into Erin Hills on a  motorcycle oddly enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p> LEVATICH:  You know this golf community I don't know what they're thinking. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly but you sell a lot of other products other than bikes  this jacket for example. </p><p> LEVATICH:  This jacket.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is gorgeous your jacket, tell us about the pricing for the  bikes today and what is the range? </p><p> LEVATICH:  We have we cover a range jackets for a lot broader that most  people think you can get into Harley for in this high 6,000, 7,000's, and  then of course we produce motorcycles that are for the aspirational owner  that are kind in the high 30s and obviously there are lot of differences  across that range but we cover that whole price spectrum with Harley- Davidson motorcycles and part of what we need to do is do a better job  informing people that there's something for everybody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially when you something wants custom made you do that. </p><p> LEVATICH:  Yes, we have custom vehicle operations heavily accessorized and  bigger engines, and you know the real ultimate product for the ultimate  passionate customer.  But again we've got a lot of stuff in between, a real  and their all great there are all high impact, really cool looking, for  young adults for women for whomever. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well I -- this is quite cool looking if I say so myself. </p><p> LEVATICH:  You look - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Matt great to have you on the show today.</p><p> LEVATICH:  Thanks for appreciating it.  Nice to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Matthew Levatich is the CEO of Harley- Davidson, we'll take a short break when we come back a wild start to the  U.S. Open Stuart Varney gives us a take on the tournament so far.  And then  Amazon patents hypocrisy, why the company wants to stop customers from  comparing prices with competitors after revolutionizing the way we prize,  back in a minute</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back we are coming to you live today from the beautiful  Erin Hills a golf course for 117th U.S. Open this morning, here in  Wisconsin.  Tee-off has begun and we are watching the day begin, welcome  back we are looking at markets this morning, a turning negative here, as  you saw earlier we were looking at a firmer beginning, and that has pretty  much evaporated.  The Dow Industrials now showing a gain at just two  points, Nasdaq is now negative, that's down two points and the S&amp;P 500,  just holding in positive territory by a quarter of a point, so markets have  turned decidedly mixed at this point.  </p><p> The couple of names were watching this morning, Kroger definitely one to  watch in terms of volume and movement the stock of the grocery giant fell  nearly 20 percent yesterday after company cut its full year for earnings  forecast.  Kroger is blaming the move on higher product cost, Kroger shares  right now as you see continuing that slide, down another two percent this  morning.</p><p> We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent that can  stop in store shopper from comparing prices on their phones.  So when  you're shopping around this technology will allow the store to see what a  shopper is searching for connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can intake  action like an e-mail or a coupon to suggest the comparable item or it can  even block access to the competitive content. </p><p> so if you are looking for a cheaper price on something, away from Amazon  might not be able to find it while in Amazon store.  Pretty incredible move  from Amazon.  Stock is up today.  Meanwhile, round two will kick off in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open.</p><p> Joining me right now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney who is a  regular watcher of golf.  Stu, good morning to you. </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  Maria, point  of correction not kickoff in golf, you tee-off.  You blast off, that is you  tee-off.  I want it if possible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is kicking off, Stu.  I have been saying that it is tee- off time all morning, but, of course, you have not been watching all  morning. </p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, I have glued. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You really wish you were here. </p><p> VARNEY:  I do, I do, I do.  I want you to make a special point of going  over to Rickie Fowler, congratulating him on being seven under, I think  latest on the board.  I want you to tell him that we miss his fashion  sense.  He used to appear in most outrageous colors, outfits, really stood  out, then all of a sudden he grew up.  I don't know what happened, he  changed and now he's a normal looking golf type guy.  So just have a quick  word with him, Maria, and straighten him out when you get the chance. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stu, aren't there rules that you are not supposed to wear stuff  like that on the golf course?  I mean, I know in tennis you really have to  stick to the wardrobe rules. </p><p> VARNEY:  Now you are talking about Wimbledon.  It remains white shirt,  white shorts whatever.  I think everybody else is - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There are no kinds of rules in golf? VARNEY:  I don't think so.  You can you can't have a Coca-Cola shirt.  You  can't do that at Masters.  I don't know about at U.S. Open.  If Rickie  Fowler wants to arrive in his pantaloons or whatever you want to call them,  that's the one.  If you wanted to arrive looking like that, I'd be cheering  him on. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  You know Stu, I have taken golf lessons just so  you know.  I took lessons with best of the best.  I have a shot to show  you, Stuart.  I don't want to get you jealous or anything but Hank Haney  gave me golf tips.  Hank Haney of course, Tiger Woods coach.  He was  showing me how to putt.  Quite exciting. </p><p> VARNEY:  So Maria, without too far on the - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm not actually a neophyte in golf as you say.</p><p> VARNEY:  I am not done yet, Maria.  Hold on.  Don't cut my segment short  here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm not good.  I never said I was good, Stuart.  OK?  I just --  I got lessons and then never played again. </p><p> VARNEY:  I will let you into a secret of mine.  I have only played once and  played nine holes only at the South Hampton Princess in Bermuda.  You know  what my score was for nine holes?  118.  So I quit playing, I caddied and I  watched all the time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good move.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.  I think so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stuart, happy father's day my friend. </p><p> VARNEY:  Thank you very much indeed, Maria.  And the same to all of you and  your staff right there. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will see you 10 minutes on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\".  Thank you,  Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. right after  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

It would it be nice. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure would be.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills this  morning in Wisconsin.

Tell us how  events are driving sales at your superstore. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  This is a huge week for us actually the biggest week of the  year.  Our number one week, only I think Christmas is number two, so we are  having a great season.  Actually seven and the last eight months, we had  double-digit comp store increases which are significant in brick-and-mortar  retail world.  And our online has tripled those.  This is a huge week for  us.  We got a lot of great gifts, this weekend will be -- this week will  break a record for our company.  This will be the biggest week as I said,  of the year. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  In fact, you've got great products right here with us.  We're  going to help out last-minute shoppers' check out some of the products that  we have on set.  Get your take on this.  First, we've got a Callaway GBD  Epic Driver. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  This is the newest, hottest driver in the market.  It just came  out January, and it's got new technology they call jailbreak technology,  got titanium in front of the club face, clearly the number one driver.  A  great gift for dad.  We have many of them in our stores so people should  come to our stores and buy them this weekend. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us about your range finders.  What is the Bushnell  technology offering?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  It's unbelievable these days.  You can shoot them, and shoot  handle will vibrate.  It's all about distance and accuracy.  They're so  much better than in the past.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes Dagen, what do you got there?</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't know.  He can tell us  the number one - </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're holding this putter here.  It's got lights on it. </p><p> SULLIVAN:  I can't see what you are looking at.  That tailor-made part -  that's the part that Rory just put into play.  That is one of the hottest  putters clearly.  Jason Day is playing that putter; Sergio won with that  putter at the Masters.  It's heavy as you can see.  It's more stable,  allows for better role.  It's a great putter and those guys playing really  well with it as you see. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jordan Spieth, one of golf's greatest moneymakers his deal with  Under Armour has introduced must-have products on the course.  Does the  store carry anything from Under Armour?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  We carry all the apparel from Under Armour.  We carry shirts,  pants.  This is a new Spieth One shoe.

It's the number one ball played in all the tours, there is more pros  playing Titlist Pro V1 than any other ball I think combined.  The new ball  is Taylor made TP 5. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much are these balls?</p><p> SULLIVAN:  The golf balls are 47.99 for titlist Pro V, Taylor made ball is  a new ball.  Actually, Justin Rose hit it.  He's getting more height but  getting the same distance so the ball is landing on the green. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amazing.  Dick Sullivan, thank you.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it  is Friday June 16th.  Your top stories right now 6:00 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning.  The Leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The  Associated Press reporting Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot  confirm the news but we are watching what's coming out of Russia this  morning.  What it means for the war on terror coming up this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A show of unity yesterday at the congressional baseball game last night,  both teams coming together for a prayer for their colleague Congressman  Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.</p><p>And President Trump praise lawmakers in the video message right before.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  by playing tonight, you are  showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of  violence or assaults on our democracy.  The game will go on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the unity was short-lived unfortunately.  House minority  leader Nancy Pelosi already back at it attacking republicans blaming them  for the nastiness in politics, what she said, coming up.</p><p>Plus, two escaped prisoners back in custody this morning thanks to hero  homeowner.  He held the two men at gunpoint until authorities arrived.</p><p>A massive minivan recall to report.  FiatChrysler pulling vehicles off of  the road over airbag concerns.  We've got the details coming up.</p><p>And Snap shares under pressure, the stocks gliding.  The lowest IPO price  for the first time since going public.  Why investors are getting real  cautious on Snapchat's parent company Snap.  That's coming up.</p><p>Plus, a President Trump supporter targeted at Starbucks.  The company  forced to apologize after a barista handed her cup that read \"build a wall\"  instead of her name.</p><p>Futures indicating the markets to open this way.  Take a look at where we  stand with three and a half hours before opening bell.  The Dow industrials  expect to open higher this morning.  They got the firmer tone.  Dow  Industrial up 25.  NASDAQ up six, S&amp;P 500 up as well.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are higher as well.  Take a look at the Eurozone indices  this morning.  And we see gains across the board.  The FTSE 100 in London  up two-thirds of one percent.  And the CAC quarante up three quarters of  one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close.  The Asian markets, as  you see.  Nikkei average in Japan up half a percent.  Hang Seng also  higher.  Although the Shanghai Composite in China was lower.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me right now from  Erin Hills at the U.S. Open, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, BGC  partner, senior strategist and Fox News Contributor, Steve Cortes.  Great  to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Beautiful morning here at Erin Hills.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the viewers get to see it but it's impossible to capture  even over TV or in word as the suns comes up here.  How gorgeous it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely beautiful.  They were just mowing the lawn, getting  ready for tee off in about an hour and a half.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It speaks to the kind of hospitality and the warmth and beauty  that we've experienced here.</p><p>CORTES:  It's called welcome to the Midwest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like how you're the self-appointed ambassador and you're from  Illinois.</p><p>CORTES:  I'm from Chicago not very far away.  But it is amazing this early  in the morning here in the course.  The serenity of the place.  It won't be  serene in a few hours.  It'll be ruckus with a lot of people, a lot of golf  going on.  But it's an incredible setting.</p><p>BARTRIOMO:  Good word, serenity, I like that.</p><p>Meanwhile, ISIS leader apparently reportedly killed.  We're going to be  talking about that, big story there.  President Trump said a long time ago,  let Russia help us on this.</p><p>CORTES:  Maria, and listen, obviously, I think this is -- not that we want  to celebrate that but this is good news, I think for the world and you're  exactly right.  I'm clearly a President Trump partisan.  We worked hard in  his campaign.  But he was right that we have no allusions that Russia is  our friend, generally.  I think they're more foe than friend.  But there  are times when we have common interest.  And when it comes to ISIS, we have  a very common interest in the Islamist terror.  And so we should welcome  their participation and their help and I think this is great news.</p><p>BARTRIOMO:  Well, this is great news if they actually killed the leader of  ISIS which is what we're hearing this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson is with us this morning.  President of the Jacob Leinenkugel  Brewing Company, Dick Leinenkugel is with us.  Texas Congressman Brian  Babin is here.  And the CEO of Harley-Davidson, Matt Levatich is with us as  well.</p><p>We've got a big show ahead.  So do stay with us throughout.</p><p>First off, we kick it off right now to the -- with what could be a major  military victory for Russia.  The country this morning is claiming that it  may have killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria.  In a statement  issued to Russian news agencies, the defense ministries says that the  country's Air Force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria.  The group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p>A top U.S. military spokesperson tells Fox News they cannot confirm the  report at this time, previous reports of al-Baghdadi death has been false.   Raqqa, of course, has been attacked on the ground and by the air by  American-backed Kurdish and Arab forces which have been closing in on the  terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p>Joining us right now, republican congressman Chuck Fleischmann of  Tennessee.  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>CHUCK FLEISCHMANN, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, TENNESSEE:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTRIOMO:  If true, how significant a development is this in the fight  against ISIS?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Oh, it's very significant.  There needs to be a world combat  against ISIS.  ISIS has been bad.  They have grown, they have spread like a  cancer and anytime that we can take out one of their leaders or deter their  horrible agenda, it's a victory for mankind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will we get actual confirmation?  I mean, how long do you think  until we know this is actually fact?  Because I know there have been a lot  of rumors that he -- over the last several years, in fact?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  The fact that the rumors are that the Russians actually did  it, it may take a while for the intelligence community to pick that up and  to get confirmation.  But ultimately, whether it was Jihadi John or anybody  else who had a horrible agenda like ISIS, any of these terrorist leaders,  when they have been killed, the truth ultimately always comes out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, it's Dagen McDowell.  But as significant as this  might be the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, American are worried,  Europeans are certainly worried about homegrown terrorists.  </p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That that's one of the biggest and major concerns.  So to that  point, what is law enforcement, what are the intelligence agencies doing  different or doing an addition to what they have been doing to make sure  that these individuals are rooted out?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, let me say this, I experienced homegrown terrorism in  Chattanooga, Tennessee, my hometown, where we lost five brave, great  soldiers and sailors.  There's a horrible attack.  So unfortunately, people  have been radicalized.  The step in the right direction would be to do what  I did.  I entered a bill -- or introduced a bill in the house to basically  combat terrorism here in America.</p><p>So we're trying to combat radicalization wherever it is but I think we do a  better job abroad sometimes than we actually do in the United States.  And  I think our intelligence community is catching up with the reality that  these people with a bad agenda whether it's ISIS, Al-Qaeda or any group of  radical Islamic terrorism has got to be stopped and the best way to do that  is to combat their hateful ideology with proper education and to reach out  and tell people exactly what they are doing.  And one of the best tools in  -- and my bill basically was going to do this.  It was going to take people  who had informally part of this bad organization who had been radicalized,  who've seen the light, who turned good and basically they were going to be  used to combat the spread of this radical horrible ideology.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, let me turn out to the congressional baseball game  last night.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, you witnessed the shooting of your fellow colleague  Steve Scalise and others on Wednesday morning.  You were there, you played  in the game last night.  How did it feel to be out on that field last  night?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  It was probably one of the most special moments that I've  experienced in my entire lifetime.  Since I've been in congress, I've seen  carnage, I alluded to the fact that we lost the five brave Americans in  Chattanooga a couple years ago.  Last night, after having experienced just  the day before the horrors of a gunman, a madman, we saw a great healing.   We showed the American people that whether we're republicans, whether we're  democrats, whether we're partisans or nonpartisans that we do unite when it  comes to the important things.</p><p>Baseball is a great American sport.  I've played it since I've been five  years old.  I'll be 55 in October.  As my coaches telling me, I'm still  good.  I went out there last night and I gave it all but I gave my heart to  Representative Scalise, to Mr. Mica, to the capitol police officers who've  been wounded, actually saving our lives, it's the beginning of a long  healing process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you give us an update on Steve Scalise?  Do you know  anything new in terms of his condition?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I do not, other than I heard thank God he was improving.  I  am so thankful that President Trump and Vice President Pence have been able  to visit him.  And I just hope and pray for his full recovery.  He is a  dear friend.  He's more than a colleague.  He is a dear friend.  We have  played baseball together.  We have surfed together.  And he's just a great  American and my heart goes out to him and his family and I pray for a full  and speedy recovery for all involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he is.  Thank you so much, congressman.  It's good to have  you on the program this morning.  We'll be watching, thank you.   Congressman Chuck Fleischmann there.</p><p>Coming up next, President Trump cracking down on illegal immigration,  cancelling the Obama era policy that protected some from deportation.  How  the change will impact Homeland Security?  We're covering that next.</p><p>Then FiatChrysler recalls nearly 300,000 cars as the auto company says  airbags may unintentionally deploy in certain vehicles.  We've got the  details straight-ahead after this break.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump scrapping in immigration policy  from the Obama administration which protected immigrant parents from being  deported.  Lauren Simonetti on all details right now.  Headlines in New  York.  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  Happy Friday, everybody.   President Trump making good on another one of his key campaign promises.   Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly formally revoking the program aimed  at protecting parents and of U.S. citizens and legal residents from being  deported.</p><p>President Obama announced the program back in 2014 but it was never fully  launched because it was apparently blocked by a federal court.  Republicans  criticizing the effort calling it back door amnesty.</p><p>Well, Fiat Chrysler recalling 297,000 minivans in North America for wiring  problem that can lead to unintended airbag deployment.  The recall of 2011  and '12 model year Dodge Grand Caravan minivans has been linked to eight  minor injuries.  The recall will begin in late July.  Dealers will replace  the wiring if needed and add protective covering.</p><p>Say it isn't so.  Butterfingers.  Nestle putting its candy business up for  sale.  The Swiss company trying to get a healthier bottom line as customers  are on the world demand healthier snacks.  The unit could be worth as much  as $3 billion.</p><p>And have you guys seen this one?  A loyal Starbucks customer in Charlotte,  North Carolina says she was targeted for supporting Donald Trump.  Kayla  Hart walked into a Starbucks, as she usually does.  This time she was  wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt and look at this.  She said her order was  labeled with that political message \"build a wall\" instead of her name and  she was ridiculed for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAYLA HART:  Build a wall and kind of shoves my drink at me and then all of  the baristas in the back started cracking up laughing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hart says she's waiting to hear from the Starbucks district  manager before deciding whether she's going to give them her business once  again, Maria.  Unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Lauren Simonetti.   That term doesn't seem like a negative insult to me and I would have said,  great.  You would have left.</p><p>CORTES:  I would have absolutely left.  I will tell you this.  As a Trump  guy who campaigned for Trump and who was -- I was accosted on public  transportation several times, complete strangers.  And far worst turns in  that.  I don't think that's insulting, by the way.  Trump campaigned on  build a wall.  So I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they were laughing at her, that's why she was upset.</p><p>CORTES:  And I'm sure they were trying to ridicule her.  And here's the  thing too.  I think it is important -- I think Dagen was mentioning off  camera that a lot of us have lost our sense of humor when it comes to  politics.  Politics had become such blood sport.  Our country is so  divided.  There's times that we can't laugh about it and there are some  things that we should laugh about it.  To me, if somebody showed me that  cup of build a wall, that's funny.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And I would have been like, yeah, build that wall.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, humor has just disappeared in the world of political  discourse.  Could everybody so offended by everything?  I say bring it  back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that's the right word that he said blood sport.  It has  become blood sport.</p><p>CORTES:  Maria, I do think too.  On a more serious point though too, why  are we so divided?  Right?  And I think we're the most divided.  We should  have been my lifetime and from my read of history, maybe the most since the  civil war, I think possibly, 60's were pretty divisive from what I can  gather.  I wasn't around then.  But in my lifetime I the most divided we've  been.  But why?</p><p>I think a couple of reasons.  One is identity politics which I think have  just run a muck, constantly identifying ourselves by our ethnic group, by  our gender.  I think that that has reached - has extenuated division.  And  then I think secondly and most importantly, slow economic growth.  Economic  anxiety always exacerbates whatever other tensions exist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Quote Bill Murray and strikes lighten up.  That will actually  reduce a lot of the anger and rage and divisiveness if people can just kind  of step back and take a breath.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>Still ahead, safety concerns for navy jet pilots to report.  Fox News  correspondent Lea Gabrielle will explain why training is currently at a  standstill for trainees.  We'll get into it next.  </p><p>Then our investors losing confidence in Snap.  What about the whole tech  sector?  The fallout after Snap sunk to its IPO price to $70 a share and  then broke it yesterday.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at Snap.  This was one of the  big stories in the stock market yesterday.  It has been anything but  picture perfect for the company.  Since it's Wall Street debut, Snap shares  fell to the IPO price yesterday of $17 a share.  And you know, we have seen  some churn going on in technology in general, right?  A lot of those big  tech names that have been the leadership of this market last year have  turned over.  What do you think about is?</p><p>CORTES:  Maria, I'll say and I've been on air pretty critical of Snapchat  and mainly because here's my sort of grand thesis, is that they sell for  free a product to a lot of people who generally don't have money,  teenagers.  But having said that, people -- I've got three teen daughters  at home, they live on Snap.  I mean, absolutely live on it.  They don't  text -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do you monetize it?  Are they making money?</p><p>CORTES:  but here's the caveat to all of that and that's my negative  comment on Snap.  But here's my positive comment and this just happened, I  believe, this week, McDonald's is hiring a quarter million workers and  they're going to do it via Snap.  They want their applications to come  which is very interesting to me.  That's very intriguing, it made me  rethink my bearish opinion of the company that if this can become a bit of  a teenager or millennial LinkedIn, well, that's utility then.  That's not  just sort of fun and silliness and that might be a way that they can  actually monetize.</p><p>So anyway, makes me rethink at least.  Back of the IPO price for somebody  who's been pretty skeptical of the company, I'm rethinking that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The issue I have always had with Snap is that it doesn't have  that high barrier to entry and you've seen Facebook and Facebooks,  Instagram innovating on this front and really rolling out Snap-like  features to not only hang onto their existing user base -- but also -- it's  a little windy here at the U.S. Open.  But also to draw -- this is  millennials age, draw people away from Snapchat and I think that that was  something that wasn't priced into the IPO initially, the ease with which  that customers can leave Snapchat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the other tech names?  You're talking  about Amazon, Google, all of the names, Apple, that have been really the  leadership of this market and yet, we're seeing a bit of a pullback?</p><p>CORTES:  I think that it's natural, to put it in context, I think compared  with the rally that they saw, particularly since the election, it's not  that material.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But look at this chart right here.</p><p>CORTES:  Well, I mean, those things are very volatile if you just got in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This week for Amazon.</p><p>CORTES:  But I also think to connect the dots here between markets and  politics.  It's ironic to me that Silicon Valley which is a place where  President Trump is probably not terribly popular, I don't think they're  going to hold a parade.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was the understatement of more than so far.</p><p>CORTES:  But it's been wonderful for Silicon Valley.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And next week, the White House is having a technology summit,  all the CEO's of big tech companies have signed on.  They're going to go to  the White House.  They're going to talk about modernizing government.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They certainly want tax reform.  Corporate tax reform.  And that  was one thing that universally every tech CEO was excited about.  So  they're going to give the president and the White House staff an earful  about pushing that harder -- pushing those republicans in congress on that  much harder than they have been.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, then there's Twitter.  Looking to jazz up the brand.   The company rolls out a new design on both the website and the app.  We're  using Twitter all the time.  I just tweeted out the shot of them hosing and  getting the golf course ready.  Is this enough you think to keep investors  happy?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I still think that Twitter wind up getting bought by  somebody.  Because it does have a great installed user base.  A  professionals who use Twitter for basically a news delivery service.   That's how you use it.  But I think in the last week, you've seen one of  the major problems with Twitter and that is the level of hate speech and  vitriol and partisan name calling that has been a problem and that's one of  the reasons that a lot of these potential acquirers of Twitter have turned  away from it because they don't want to be associated with that and you  can't monetize nastiness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Same problem though.  How do you monetize?</p><p>CORTES:  I do think you're right, Dagen, though.  I do think that there is  a floor relatively close because of that takeover potential.  I'm not  saying that means necessarily buy the stock, but I do think there's  somewhat of an embedded -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who wants it?  We've been down this road before.  Nobody want  it.</p><p>CORTES:  And I will say the same time.  Look, when you have the president  of the United States who has become the Twitter in chief who lives on this  medium and it still can't seem to monetize, right?  That I will admit  that's a problem, that comes from somebody, I use it all day every day for  business reasons, for sports reasons, for fun, it's incredible but I don't  spend a dime.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes to the point though.  If you say you follow President  Trump and you retweet everything that he does, Twitter identifies that,  what are they going to sell to you?  What ads are they going to serve to  you other than \"Make America Great Again\" hats and t-shirts?  What does  that say about what type of shampoo or laundry detergent you like?  It  doesn't say anything, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And also, how you're going to add an advertisement to 140  characters?  You can't.  I mean, there's no advertising revenue model.</p><p>CORTES:  And that's where Facebook, I think, right?  We have learned  clearly was much superior in terms of monetizing, right?  And in terms of  not being limited by the characters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a short break.  When we come back, keeping America  safe.  A reported additional 4,000 troops will be headed to Afghanistan to  break a stalemate with the Taliban.  What the deployment means for  President Trump and the country?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from the U.S. Open at Erin Hills Golf Course in  Wisconsin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning, everybody.

We've got a  preview of the highly-anticipated new film ahead of the weekend.</p><p>First, though, breaking news this morning, Russia has claimed that it has  killed the head of ISIS.  The country is investigating reports that an  airstrike in Syria took out Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last  month.  The U.S. has not confirmed this death but we're waiting on more  information.  Joining us right now is Fox News Correspondent, former Navy  fighter pilot, Lea Gabrielle.  Lea, thanks for joining the conversation.   What would al-Baghdadi's death mean for the war on terror in your view?</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first off, Maria, I  think we just have to take this with a bit of skepticism at this point.   And I know that the intelligence community and the U.S. military are going  to be looking at evidence and all of our ability to get situational  awareness on this to figure out, did he actually die?  Because there have  been reports in the past even back in 2015, there were reports that he was  killed but then in May of that same year, he released a radio or an audio  message basically urging Muslims to immigrate to the caliphate.  He is  somebody, who there has been essentially a bounty on him for quite some  time.  So it would be significant if he was killed but again, I think at  this point, we have to take it with some skepticism until we hear more from  us officials.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, you are waiting on information.  When do you  expect we will hear - or, I mean, how quickly do you think they can get to  the bottom of it?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's really tough to be able to say right now.  You  know, there are a lot of different sources of information that the U.S.  will be using, we'll be using our own sources of information but also  working with allies and I would expect that the U.S. would also be trying  to get information from Russia to find out what sort of evidence they do  have to assess whether or not he was actually killed. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Lea, training for jet pilots in the U.S. Navy still at a  standstill, I want to get your take on this.  In April, pilots of the  Navy's jet trainer refused to fly because of safety concerns.  You've been  talking about this for a long time, and of course, the Navy ordered a pause  in training while it conducted a review of the problems.  You were first to  obtain the result of the review and you spoke exclusively to the Navy's  number two officer.  Tell us about it.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, Maria, the bottom line is that the Navy still can't say  when the T-45, the Navy's only jet trainer will actually start flying  again.  And the report says that finding a solution to the problem has  proved elusive, that's a quote.  In other words, there isn't one yet.  The  issues with the basic life support systems in the both the T-45 trainer and  in the F-18 Hornet, those are systems that are supposed to provide clean  breathable air to the aircrew but reports of incidents where pilots and  crew became impaired have been on the rise, increasing in a lot of models  last year.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I visited with in Virginia Beach for an exclusive look at the  latest technology being used to train F-18 pilots to handle aircraft system  failures that have been plaguing the fleet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let's say we got the feel of the nose there.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  The reduced oxygen breathing device allows pilots to experience  oxygen loss while flying but in the safety of a simulator.  As a former F- 18 pilot, I gave it a try.</p><p>CMDR. JEFF FARMER, VFA-131 COMMANDING OFFICER:  If we can put this oxygen  mask on and slowly decrease that amount of oxygen concentration that we're  getting to simulate as best we can exactly what would the pilot would  experience in the airplane itself.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  All set.  Hands up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Pilots could become dizzy, euphoric or even pass out.</p><p>Basically, what I fell is (INAUDIBLE) it's severely uncomfortable.  It's  hard to concentrate.</p><p>FARMER:  So far, it's been very successful in helping people recognize  those symptoms before they experience any kind of cognitive or, you know,  worst yet, loss of consciousness.  Your heart rate is coming up a little  bit.  You might notice that yourself.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  One training goal, to recognize the symptoms and pool a green  ring, which gives the pilot up to 10 minutes of emergency oxygen.</p><p>One of the reasons for all this training in a simulator is because pilots  are reporting more problems in planes like these, and when you're flying in  the air in an F-18, it can be a matter of life and death.  In fact, we  learned some pilots are more concerned about their life support systems  failing than the risk of combat.  The pilot we spoke within Virginia  disagree.</p><p>CAPT. MARC MIGUEZ, CARRIER AIR WING THREE COMMANDER:  I see no problems  operating safety under our current mitigation strategy that we're doing  right now.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  The Navy review released just today said it view these episodes  as a number one safety priority and announced an unconstrained resource  approach to finding a solution.  I spoke with Admiral Bill Moran who  ordered the review.</p><p>ADM. BILL MORAN, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS:  The system, the aircraft  ought to operate the way it was designed to operate.  And it's up to us to  figure out how to get that airplane back to that level of performance.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, as you saw in the case of a system failure, pilots have  to manually activate emergency oxygen even if they're impaired.  Admiral  Moran says that an automatic system is the goal.  He also tells me that if  they're not able to get the training site going again by the end of the  summer, it will impact operational readiness.  But, Maria, he said that -  he says that the Navy is getting close.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this a cost issue?  I mean, what does this mean for the F-35  program, and what's behind it, Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's - those are two great questions.  I mean, first of  all, I did ask Admiral Moran about the cost.  And he said that they are  putting all the resources into this.  That cause is not a factor in trying  to solve this problem.  So, it's an unconstrained resource approach, it's  basically what they're calling it in the Navy.  Now, the F-35 is  essentially a different animal, but it's a Navy jet, it's an Air Force jet,  it's a Marine Corps jet, and a wing in Arizona.  Just had to ground the F- 35 because of this type of problem where there were 5 reported incidents.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>Now, reportedly, they're going to start flying again probably this weekend,  but the same issues are impacting the F-35, Maria.  Of course, the F-35  program is an extremely costly program.  It's sort of a jack of all trades  and it's been a struggle making it an airplane that can sort of master so  many different trades, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You make all great points.  I want to bring the panel in  here because we have been talking about the age of the Navy fleet, the Army  fleet, but we're talking about some of the oldest fleets in decades, and  that is a cost issue.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And General Mattis actually -  I think it was yesterday - made a comment about the sequestration and the  budget, the defense budget cuts that were in that and how devastating that  was, and that it will take years for the defense department to recover from  that.  But however, the upside is that you do have a President now in  Donald Trump dedicated to rebuilding the defense and our - and our  military.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know - yes, I think, Maria, to that point and I'm  sure Lea is correct that this particular issue isn't a cost issues but in  general, I think there's a ton of cost issues.  If you talk to people -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, that's why he's focused on it in the budget.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  And if you talk to  people in the military, they will say we are simply not ready.  We're not  ready to fight.  And by the way, it's unconscionable to put our fighting  men and women into the position where they don't have the proper equipment  or training that they need to probably defend America.  And I think it's  one of the reasons that Trump won and to also connect the dots between the  policy here and markets, I think the markets certainly believe that we're  going to spend what we need to if you look at Boeing stocks, for instance.   Boeing hitting another huge all-time high just yesterday.  I think, to me,  that has been really a Trump stock because of combination of defense and  infrastructure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, even though he was one of the first people that Trump  called out.</p><p>CORTES:  I know.  Ironically.  Ironically, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On Twitter.  Meanwhile, Lea, then there's the war in  Afghanistan.  The Pentagon reportedly planning to send nearly 4,000  additional troops to the country to break the stalemate with the Taliban.   The President gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the power to determine  troop levels in Afghanistan earlier this week.  What's your take on this?   Will this turn the tide of the war?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, it's going to be necessary to turn the tide of the war,  and that's according to the senior commander on the ground there who said  that additional troops are needed in order to do that.  The Taliban  fighting season is about to get underway there, so I think that that's  probably part of the reason for this decision right now, but of course,  Secretary Mattis has just said that we are not winning there.  So, the only  way to win is to increase the number of troops level and I think - troop  levels, and I think that that's what they're trying to do.  They -- the  Pentagon is reviewing the strategy in Afghanistan, and the Secretary of  Defense said that that may take several weeks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a stunning comment that Secretary Mattis made the  other day, wasn't it, that we are not winning in Afghanistan.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  Well - and you know, listen, I think the honesty is  important, all right.  And then, how do we address it?  How do we start to  win?  And perhaps 4,000 more troops is the first step there.  I will tell  you I'm normally on board with the Trump administration on just about  everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CORTES:  I worry about us escalating Afghanistan.  I worry about the  quagmire, we've been there for a heck of a long time, and we really won  over the hearts and minds of the people, I'm not so sure, but I do love the  honesty of the analysis of the situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It certainly was.  Lea, great to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lea Gabrielle there.  Coming up, from clicks to bricks,  Amazon's new patent that could stop in-store customers from comparing the  company's prices online.  We'll tell you about that coming next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're live from beautiful Erin Hills this morning in Wisconsin  for the 117th U.S. Open.  We have the very latest on the Open day two here  in Erin Hills.  Welcome back.  We're looking at markets that are going to  be opening higher this morning.  Futures are indicating some firmness right  here.  Take a look at the Dow Industrials up about 20 points, NASDAQ up  about 9 points, fractionally off of the highs of the morning.  </p><p>A couple names we're watching this morning, Kroger is one to watch, for  sure.  Shares of the grocery giant fell nearly 20 percent yesterday after  the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast.  Kroger blamed the  move on higher product costs.  Kroger shares this morning are fractionally  higher.  We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent  that can stop in-store shoppers from comparing prices on their phones.  The  technology allows stores to see what a shopper is searching for while  connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can then take action like e-mail a  coupon or suggesting comparable items, even block access to competitive  content.  Amazon shares are up this morning.  I don't know if I like this  technology.  What do you guys think about that?</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  It's a bit Big Brother-ish but then again -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very Big Brother-ish.</p><p>CORTES:  -- you also don't have to get on their Wi-Fi, right?  Just do it  on your - I'm not sure that -- I don't think that - I'm no techie, but I  don't think Amazon could stop you from just being on your mobile signal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But if you want to go online and see if a -- you can get a  product somewhere else cheaper, you should be able to.  I don't know if I'm  in Amazon or not.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's my two cents on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, a nationwide manhunt ended in triumph for Tennessee  law enforcement yesterday.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details in New  York this morning.  She's got headlines.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Quite a story, Maria.   Two inmates who escaped from a Georgia prison back on Tuesday, they were  captured after attempting to steal a Tennessee man's car.  Police say the  man held the fugitives at gunpoint with a neighbor until law enforcement  came to arrest them.  Prior to this, the pair held a Tennessee couple  hostage in their home, tying them up with a rope, eating their food, and  stealing their stuff.  </p><p>Well, Ricky Dubose and Donnie Rowe, there they are, both serving time for  armed robbery.  They escaped the Putnam County jail after shooting two  prison guards and driving off in a hijacked vehicle.  They are being  extradited back to Georgia where they will face multiple charges.  Nike  wants to be quicker on its feet so it's cutting 1400 jobs and eliminating a  quarter of its shoe styles as it faces increase competition from smaller  brands and premium labels, all part of a plan to also start selling  sneakers more directly to customers online.</p><p>Big win for Netflix, leapfrogging cable T.V.  According to a new study,  Netflix have more 50 million subscribers last quarter, that's 2 million  more than cable marketing.  The first time Netflix has taken the lead.  </p><p>And Jean Simmons says the horns are mine.  The longtime member of Kiss has  filed an application with the U.S. patent and trademark office Friday to  claim his official ownership of that hand gesture right there, the horns.   His legal team included a sketch of the gesture, plus a picture of him  using it.  A trademark typically protects brand names and logos on goods  and services, but now maybe hand gestures, too.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  So, what do you - what do you guys  think?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is the dumbest idea ever.  This is not associated with  Kiss.  I do this every time I did \"RED EYE\" and every time I do \"KENNEDY\".   It's just -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you didn't get it from him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's having a (INAUDIBLE) I don't listen to Kiss.  And by the  way, how about the Texas Longhorns.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  I was going to say.  For the - for the Texas Longhorn  nation, they will view this as their Alamo to fight against losing - right?  - the hook and horns.  He might as well trademark the thumbs-up, right?   Now - but having said all of that, this is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Now, Donald Trump is going to -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's a thumbs down and -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CORTES:  Jean Simmons is a marketing genius and he might have done this for  this exact reason.  We're talking about him, he's been shown on air.  So  perhaps -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got us, Jean.  You got us.</p><p>CORTES:  Perhaps his method (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, make me pay for this.  Make me pay to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, will the new Cars movie drive into the number one  spot at the box office this weekend?  Are you going to the film, have a  kid-friendly flick?  We'll we stack up next to Wonder Woman.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we get some pictures?  </p><p>MCQUEEN:  Yes, yes.  Come on, let's get a picture.  You know what, get  (INAUDIBLE) picture because champ here has been a role model of mine for  years now, and I mean, a lot of years, right?  I love this guy.  I think I  touched a nerve.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from the new Disney Pixar film Cars 3, hitting  theaters this weekend.  It's the third installment in a series which  follows racecar Lightning McQueen as he struggles with growing older.</p><p>Joining us right now in the Fox Light host and Senior Vice President of  Marketing at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  Michael, good to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:   Maria, good to see you.  Where is everyone?  Again, I'm alone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're here at the U.S. Open.  We're here at Erin Hills.  We  wish you were - we wish you were here, Michael.  So, let me ask you about  Cars because Wonder Woman is still on fire, right?  But the last Cars film  grossed $66 million opening weekend at the box office.  What are you  expecting?  You think it stacks up against the record-breaking Wonder Woman  this weekend?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely.  I think it's going to - in this - the fast lane to  number one at this weekend's box office.  Look, Wonder Woman is probably  going to be the movie of the summer 2017.  It's on track to get about $500  million so far, and is opening up in 7 more markets across the globe this  weekend, but Cars?  Look, we're hearing a lot about franchise fatigue this  summer between Aliens and Pirates of the Caribbean.  This is one franchise  that is still hot.  It looks to take in 55 about to $60 million this  weekend, pretty good.  Not bad for Disney which has had an incredible year  between Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's another family-friendly movie, which is always  loved.  By the way, last weekend, I saw Wonder Woman.  I thought it was  good.</p><p>TAMMERO:  What did you think?  Fantastic, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I liked it a lot.  I - well, I didn't know the story  of when she was a young girl, so that was interesting.  But here we are at  Erin Hills, Michael, and you ranked the top three golf films of all time in  honor of our live coverage from the U.S. Open.  Give me your number three  pick.</p><p>TAMMERO:  We did.  I asked people on social media and it was almost  consensus.  No one agrees on social media but everyone said these three  movies.  So, number three, Maria, of the top golf movies of all time,  debuted in 1996, Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, and Don  Johnson.  The story about a washed-up golf pro working at a driving range  who tries to qualify for the U.S. Open in order to win the heart of his  successful girlfriend.  It debuted at number one and earned about $53  million at the box office.  That was a good story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a great story.  One of my faves, Dagen.  And you - and  you and I love Kevin Costner.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love that movie and I love the fact that it's basically like  my Major League because Rene Russo was in Major League with Tom Barringer,  so it just made (INAUDIBLE) golf.  It's a very similar storyline, actually.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Probably the last thing for Don Johnson, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  He was good in that, too.  It was a great  film.  I don't know if that would be my number three pick, it might even be  - it might be my number two, but what is your number two pick, Michael?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Number two, 1996, Adam Sandler.  I feel like old Adam Sandler  movies should be introduced with a sigh.  Happy Gilmore debuted at number  two at the box office, bringing in about $38 million.  A rejected hockey  player puts his skills to the golf course to save his grandmother's house.   One of the big hits of Adam Sandler but not his biggest.</p><p>CORTES:  Well, Maria, we can only hope that Bob Barker is going to get in a  fight somewhere today on Erin Hills, right, and reenact my favorite scene  from that movie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a great movie, it was so funny.  We will see about  that.  All right.  We are down to number one, Michael, and I think we all  agree this is set certainly a winner.  Let's take a look at the clip from  your number one pick.  Watch this.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Let's do it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This crowd has gone deadly silent.  Cinderella story.   I don't know where, a former greenskeeper, now about to become the Masters  champion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It looks like I'm going to rack.  It's in the whole.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Caddyshack.  Who can doubt this is probably the top golf movie of  all time?  It debuted at number one, $39 million at the box office back in  1980, starring Chevy Chase, what a cast, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill  Murray, all chasing that little gopher around the golf course blowing  things up, which is what I want to do when I play golf because I'm awful at  it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Ted Knight makes it, right, as Judge Smails?</p><p>TAMMERO:  That's right.  Not to be confused with -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Not to be confused with Caddyshack 2, starring Jackie Mason,  which was just god-awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God, you're right.  I forgot about that.  So, why was  Caddyshack your - Caddyshack your top pick?  It's - I mean, I know  everybody online liked it.</p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, it's funny, I watched it last night and it holds up.   It's a classic movie from the 80s.  You know, Bill Murray and Rodney  Dangerfield at their best.  I recommend everyone this weekend celebrate the  U.S. Open and go back and watch it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a great point.  Yes, you're right, it was really funny.

Happy Friday -- everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us here in Erin Hills, Wisconsin.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, June 16th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news this morning -- the leader of ISIS reportedly has been  killed.  The Associated Press reporting that Russia is claiming that it  killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an airstrike in Syria.  At this point, the  U.S. military says that they cannot confirm this news but the President has  long stressed that getting help is the way to take down ISIS.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have a lot of  great success over the next coming years.  And we want to get as many to  help fight terrorism as possible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What this means to the war on terrorism, coming up this  morning.</p><p>Meanwhile Facebook ramps up its efforts against extremist content. The  social media giant is now turning to artificial intelligence to do so.  We  will have the details.</p><p>A show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  are coming together for a prayer for their colleague; Congressman Steve  Scalise still in critical condition.  They did that ahead of the first  pitch last night.</p><p>Scalise underwent another surgery.  He is still in critical condition but  the hospital says his condition has improved in the last 24 hours.</p><p>New details this morning on the health of Otto Warmbier, the American  detainee just released from North Korea.

This Friday morning, we're looking at money moving into stocks.  Dow  Industrials up about 20 points.  Nasdaq up about 10 points, fractional  moves, nonetheless in the plus-plus column.</p><p>In Europe, similar story -- stocks are higher across the board in the  Eurozone.  The indices look like this.  FT100 up two-thirds of 1 percent as  is the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX index in Germany up a quarter of a  percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, mostly higher in fact.  Best  performer was Japan -- Nikkei average up one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>It is day two of the U.S. Open.  It is getting underway shortly.  We have a  recap of yesterday's action. Everything you need to know as golfers tee up  today.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk about it,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and BGC Partners senior strategist  Fox News contributor Steve Cortes with us as well.</p><p>I'm looking forward to hearing the claps.  It's just so relaxing when you  see them beginning to tee off.  </p><p>STEVE CORTES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  As I mentioned before, a golf  course in the morning this early -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CORTES:  -- there is a certain serenity.  But there won't be serenity soon.   They'll be cheering and a raucous nature to this place and it's exciting.   I am so glad as a Midwesterner that the U.S. Open has decided to come back  to the Midwest.  And I think -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I like how you being from Chicago, from Illinois, you're taking  credit.  </p><p>CORTES:  I've appointed myself.  I'm not going to tell people of Wisconsin  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's like me taking credit, for like the way people get  treated in Alabama, for example.</p><p>CORTES:  And here at a relatively new golf course which is also unique.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's just talk about yesterday.  The players have never played  this course.  And it's a different course.  It's real long -- what was the  tallying (ph) of yesterday?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nine miles.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nine miles they're walking as opposed to six miles, which is  sort of the average.  </p><p>CORTES:  Right.  And hilly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And hilly.</p><p>CORTES:  No, I think it definitely will favor -- a hot day yesterday.   We'll see what it's like today and into the weekend.  Nice and cool now,  but we'll see once the sun comes up.</p><p>I think that tends to favor the fitter golfers, the younger golfers.  So  it's a more physical test perhaps than they're used on some other courses.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big story of the day, of course, the head of ISIS may have been  killed.  We want to follow that this morning.</p><p>Coming up talking all about it this morning and joining the conversation is  the CEO of Kalahari Resort Todd Nelson is here; the President of Jacob  Leinenkugel Brewing Company Dick Leinenkugel; Texas Congressman Brian Babin  is with us; and the CEO of Harley-Davidson Matthew Levatich is with us as  well; plus PGA Tour Superstore president and CEO Dick Sullivan is with us  as well.  He'll give us an update on what we're seeing today in golf and  the golf business in general.</p><p>First though, our top story this hour.  What could be a major military  victory for Russia -- the country claiming that it may have killed ISIS  leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria one month ago.  In the statement  issued through Russian news agencies, the defense ministry there says that  the country's air force struck a meeting of ISIS leaders outside of Raqqa,  Syria the group's de facto capital possibly killing Baghdadi late last  month.</p><p>Now the U.S. military says that it cannot confirm this news yet.  We're  waiting for more confirmation from the U.S.  But Raqqa, of course, has been  under attack on the ground and by air by American-backed Kurdish and Arab  forces which have been closing in on the terrorist group in recent weeks.</p><p>Joining us right now is a former army intelligence officer Andrew Peek.   Andrew -- thanks so much for weighing in here.  What do you think this  means in the fight against ISIS?</p><p>ANDREW PEEK, FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER:  Well, gosh -- if Russian  forces killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic state it would  be singlehandedly the biggest justification for Donald Trump's foreign  policy to date.  You know, I think it would really be a massive stamp of  approval for his efforts to reach out to Russia and to make concessions in  other parts of the world like Eastern Europe in exchange for getting more  cooperation against the Islamic state in Syria and Iraq.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because even during the campaign, then candidate Trump said  many times -- look ok, Russia may not be our friend but there's no reason  we should not be working side-by-side with them against terrorism, against  ISIS.  Let them take him out.  He said it many times.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  That's exactly right.  And he took a lot of heat from that  because that was on the heels of not just Russia interfering potentially  with the DNC e-mails and the election hacking but also about a year after  Russia had essentially invaded Ukraine and fomented a massive insurgency in  that country.</p><p>So there was a lot of legacy weight of hostility with Russia that frankly  actually mirrored what Obama came into office with in 2009 after the  Georgia war in August 2008.  However, if Baghdadi is actually dead, that  would be a mark of approval for Trump's foreign policy and really I think  put to rest a lot of the conspiracy theories in this town in Washington  about his obeisance to Moscow.  </p><p>CORTES:  Well, you know -- hey, Steve Cortes here -- I have a question for  you.  I mean I think, you know, when we look at history for instance, we  teamed up with Stalin, very unsavory Russian character right, to take on  Hitler.  Can't we at times -- doesn't it just make good common sense for us  at times to team up with people who may be disreputable or may not have our  best interests at heart but when we have a common interest, such as  defeating ISIS doesn't it just make good strategic sense for us to then  unite as we have in this case against ISIS?  </p><p>PEEK:  No, I think it does.  I think the challenge has been in Syria that  we have two goals.  It's not just defeating ISIS but it's also replacing it  with a regime that is not Bashar al-Assad because Assad keeps gassing his  own people.  And unfortunately that is Russia's goal.</p><p>So we've been looking for a third way that involves defeating ISIS but not  winding up with Bashar al-Assad back in control of Syria.  And what I think  you have seen Trump do is make the decision that at least in the interim we  are not going to pursue both goals simultaneously.  We're going to get rid  of ISIS and then we're going to move on afterwards to dealing with the  political transition in Syria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the comment that Secretary Mattis made the other day  that we are not winning in Afghanistan.  What's your take on that --  Andrew?</p><p>PEEK:  Frankly if we weren't winning with 100,000 troops in Afghanistan  under Obama I don't know why we're going to be winning with 12,000 under  Donald Trump.  I don't know what additional difference another 4,000 troops  is going to make.  I think that that is the stopgap measure.</p><p>I think it kicks the ball down the road for when we have to have the  politically really hard discussion of when are we going to pull most of our  people out.  I think we were at the border of having that about a year ago.   I think the issue is going to be funding for the Afghan government going  forward.  But I truly don't see why 4,000 troops is going to make a big  difference.</p><p>I have to say I have the greatest respect for the commander on the ground,  Nick Nicholson.  We served together there, very smart guy, cream in the  army but I don't see this being a game changer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andrew -- let me ask you about social media here because  Facebook is tapping artificial intelligence now.  They say it's a new push  to block terrorist propaganda.  The social media giant says that it will  use algorithms to root out words and images related to extremism.  Facebook  is using a team of 150 members including counterterrorism experts to take  down related posts.  Do you think this is enough?  What do you make of this  push by Facebook?  </p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  I don't really trust the tech companies to decide what is and  what isn't extremist speech.  You know, I think I don't want to always put  the onus on political correctness but these are West Coast companies that  over the long term are not going to be able to say hey, we're only going to  focus on Islamic radicalism and Islamic hate speech.</p><p>I think there is going to be a strong temptation to move into all kinds of  extremist speech however they want to define that from radical Islam to  radical right-wing groups to radical left-wing groups.  And that is  gradually going to bleed over into political discourse.</p><p>What I would like to see is more effort on the backend from the  intelligence community and not frankly kind of the front end with the tech  companies censoring the narrative.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Andrew, that's been one of the problems is that people cried  out that as conservatives, that their speech had been shut down by  Facebook.  You know, anytime anything is flagged by another Facebook user,  you basically get ixnayed on the site while they have allowed these sites  particularly Twitter was worse than Facebook for a very long time in terms  of allowing just rampant propaganda. </p><p>This is something that needed to happen quite frankly and they are doing it  because they would rather do it themselves than then allow the government  end because again if they don't take control of it, I'll tell you what,  folks from the government absolutely will.</p><p>And which is one more thing, these tech companies for some time legally had  to police and look for and take down and report to authorities child  pornography.  And they had automated ways to do that and they pushed back  and said well, we can't do that with terrorist propaganda but it turns out  they can and they are.  </p><p>PEEK:  Dagen -- I think that is true but the only reason they are now  pushing back on the radical Islamic themes is that they have a president  who is putting the political pressure on them, right.  Once that  administration changes, and at some point, of course it will, the pressure  is going to be off and they're going to go back to censoring a whole array  of messages at best; and at worst, none at all.</p><p>So that's really a function, there is no institutional way on the tech  companies.  It's really a function of Trump's focus on calling the enemy  radical Islam.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's great insight from you as always -- Andrew.  Thanks  so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>PEEK:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Andrew Peek joining us there in New  York.</p><p>Coming up, grave new health concerns for the 22-year-old held hostage by  North Korea for over a year.  Why U.S. doctors now are disputing the claims  that Otto Warmbier was in a coma -- those claims from North Korea. </p><p>And a touching tribute to the original Hollywood hero -- how Los Angeles  honored Batman star Adam West last night.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open this morning.  It is round two, at least  -- meanwhile ten tornadoes have touched down in northeast Wisconsin.  That  happened yesterday.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  An hour and a half from you -- Maria.</p><p>One of those tornadoes first hit in Fox Crossing yesterday afternoon,  leaving a trail of damage six miles long.  The twister had peak winds of 95  miles an hour.  Police say one man was injured by flying debris when the  roof of a car wash was torn off in Kimberly.  The local utility says the  tornado outbreak's the largest storm even it's seen since 2010.</p><p>Well, parents, you'll want to listen to this one.  A study by an  environmental group finds detectable levels of lead in 20 percent of baby  food samples.  Those samples were taken by the FDA over a 10-year period.   The types of baby food most affected -- grapes, apples, pears, mixed fruit  juices, sweet potatoes, carrots and teething biscuits.  Studies have shown  that children exposed to lead can experience behavioral problems and have  lower IQs as a result.</p><p>And doctors say an American college student released from captivity this  week by North Korea has extensive brain damage.  Otto Warmbier was held for  17 months in a North Korean jail.  Doctors describe his condition as a --  and this is a quote -- \"a state of unresponsive wakefulness.  Otto's  father, Fred Warmbier, was a guest on Fox News' \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\"  last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRED WARMBIER, FATHER OF OTTO WARMBIER:  This is a rogue pariah regime.   They are terrorists.  They are brutal.  There's no sense to anything here.   They have crossed a line with my son, Otto, and so it would be very  difficult to look for a lesson here amongst this insanity.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We feel for that family.  Otto Warmbier serving a 15-year  sentence for allegedly trying to steal a political poster that contains a  slogan that he wanted to take from a wall in his hotel room in Pyongyang.</p><p>And L.A. turned into Gotham City once again last night.  This, to honor the  late Adam West, who played Batman on the TV show in the 1960s.  West died  last week at the age of 88.  At an L.A. city hall ceremony officials and  hundreds of fans were joined by Catwoman Lee Meriwether, Catwoman and Burt  Ward.  He played Robin on the \"Batman\" series.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURT WARD, FORMER ACTOR:  He spent his entire life as a performer making  people happy, making them laugh and trying to make this world a better  place.  So thank you for coming out.  Wowie-zowie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And then the L.A. police chief lit the bat signal, there it is,  summoning the caped crusader one final time.  And we say -- holy tribute,  Batman -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.  Thank you so much -- Lauren.</p><p>Still ahead, putting Cuba relations back on ice.  President Trump prepares  to roll back relations with Havana.  This is expected in the next couple of  days.  What it means for businesses investing in the country.</p><p>And then your next business convention could be fun for the whole family --  Kalahari Resort CEO Todd Nelson on his brilliant business model.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills here in Wisconsin.  We're at the 117th U.S. Open and  it is day two.</p><p>With school out for summer it is time to head for fun in the sun.  Kalahari  Resorts featuring three locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and right here in  Wisconsin combine a family-friendly vacation atmosphere with a state-of- the-art convention center space.  The company is now investing $65 million  to double the size of their convention space proving that a business model  that combines a waterslide park with massive convention center space is  quite the attraction.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about it is the CEO of Kalahari Resort,  Todd Nelson.  Todd -- good to see.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TODD NELSON, KALAHARI RESORT:  Well, thank you for having me.  It's a  pleasure to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting but usually people go on a business  trip and they don't bring their family but you are offering them to do  both.  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh yes.  And it works marvelously.  People find that their  attendance actually goes up when they have it a resort like ours.  And so  it's just a proven business.</p><p>We're doubling the size of our convention facility in Dells because our  groups have grown so large that they are outgrowing us, which is a  wonderful problem.  So we are doubling the size of that.  And we're  doubling the size of the one in the Pocono Mountains.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is business right now?  </p><p>NELSON:  Business is outstanding.  And people love what we do.  You go and  you have fun and you play and it is -- it's basically Vegas hotel without a  casino but an indoor water park and an indoor theme park.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is so cool.</p><p>CORTES:  You know, Todd, I will tell you for all, I am a customer.  My kids  absolutely love your theme park -- the one in Wisconsin Dells.  What are  the hindrances to growth?  I mean your company is obviously doing well.  It  sounds like you're very optimistic on business.  But what are the obstacles  and particularly in terms of public policy type of scenario?  What could be  better from your perspective to grow Kalahari?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, we're in major growth mode right now.  I guess my biggest  problem is that I have more ideas and more sites than I have money.</p><p>CORTES:  Ok. </p><p>NELSON:  So we have three in the works right now.  Our next one is going to  be in Round Rock, Texas.  We have a site we're looking at in Massachusetts  and in Virginia.  And we're a privately held company.  It's my wife and I  and our five kids and so we're growing as quickly as we can.  But, you  know, just to get the money to do these -- they're very expensive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well you talk about -- you say money.  What about the  availability of credit.  I'm assuming that you borrowed to build these  facilities.  What are the capital markets like right now for you?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, we have the most unusual model you have ever seen.  We build  small community banks so our Pennsylvania projects we have 65 small  community banks, most of those from Wisconsin, I think about seven from  Pennsylvania, our tiny little hometown back in Wisconsin Dells and this big  consortium of banks.  And it is relatively easy.  They require us to put a  lot of money down so what we do is we save and we build and then save again  and build again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because that's a segment of the market that,  you know, lawmakers have been saying they are not lending enough to small  banks and they're trying to loosen things up so it probably becomes even  better an environment for you.  </p><p>NELSON:  It's a wonderful environment and especially because they're small  community banks so they don't have all of the red tape that some of the  larger banks do.  You can pick up the phone and call the president of the  bank they take your call and they're happy to do business with you.  It is  a wonderful model.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>What do people want now when they're traveling?  I mean I know technology  has really added lots of different choices but what do people, families  whether it's on the convention side of things or the waterslide side of  things -- what are they looking for that is different?  </p><p>NELSON:  They're looking to be entertained for the entire time they're with  us.  Our average stay is only 1.9 days so they're there for 40 hours.  And  so we need to keep them busy the entire time.  So we are building indoor  theme parks with ferris wheels, ropes course, miniature golf, go karts,  really food and beverage options -- that is very, very important.</p><p>We're just getting into the virtual reality right now at all three of our  locations -- that is been very popular.  So just, they want to be  constantly kept busy and moving.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Virtual reality.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to know how you're innovating in terms of the actual  slides and the water features that you put in these parks.  I'm a water  park junkie and have been since I was little and I still go.  And so I want  to know, like how are you innovating?   Or is it just kind of an expansion  of what we have been seeing the last 20 years or so?  </p><p>NELSON:  It's really whatever we can dream up, they can build.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Really.</p><p>NELSON:  Yes.  And it's incredible -- I just got back two days ago.  My son  and I -- we went over to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kazakhstan (ph) and  Kuwait.  And we were looking at indoor theme parks.  They have the best  indoor theme parks in the world over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they, really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  Oh absolutely.  Just tremendous stuff.  And we learned so much.   So we traveled.  Most of the waterslide companies are in Canada so we go  and visit them frequently and we talk about what we can do.  Uphill  waterslides are getting very popular.</p><p>It's a great business.  We get to dream and play and have fun.  And now we  just have -- we have nine grandchildren now, my wife and I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My goodness.</p><p>NELSON:  And so we have created the coolest little areas for one to five- year-olds.  They're just spectacular.  So water tables and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to go and hang out with Grandpa Todd and all his fun  toys.  </p><p>NELSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I tell the four other grandpas, I say, you know,  you don't have a chance.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, they don't.  You're right they don't have a chance to  compete.  </p><p>NELSON:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  So you learn some good stuff in Dubai and the  rest of them -- Dubai has a lot of indoor attractions, right.  </p><p>NELSON:  Yes, they do.  It's very hot over there.  It's 120 degrees when we  were over there.  And so we saw everything from a $2 million indoor theme  park to a billion-dollar indoor them park and it was life lessons really  well learned and so we'll take that all down to Texas and Pennsylvania and  around.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we look forward to that.  I know the Poconos properties  are real hot right now as well.  </p><p>NELSON:  It's smoking hot.  We love that East Coast market too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Smoking hot -- we'll take it.</p><p>Todd -- great to see you.</p><p>NELSON:  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the developments -- Todd  Nelson joining us.</p><p>Coming up re-chilling relations with Cuba.  President Trump is bringing  back harsher restrictions on Havana.

Take a  look at the Eurozone indices and we see the FTSE 100 up two thirds of a  percent.  As is the CAC quarante in Paris and the DAX index in Germany, up  a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close in Asia.  As you see,  best performer was Japan, up just one half of one percent.  Hang Seng up a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>Another milestone for the final frontier.  A Russian ship set to dock with  the international space station later this hour.  The incredible images  coming up this morning.</p><p>First though our top story this half an hour.  President Trump is set to  unveil a new Cuba policy directive today in Miami.  Fox News can now  confirm it will include strict enforcement of travel exemptions between the  U.S. and Cuba.  Commerce between American companies and Cuban businesses  owned by its military and intelligence services would also reportedly be  prohibited.</p><p>The state department will also create a special taskforce to help expand  internet access for Cubans.  President Trump is reportedly expected to call  for the release of Cuban political prisoners.</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh on is the co-host of The Five, Juan Williams.   Juan, good to see you.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of these changes to the Obama era policy  really?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  The art of the deal, Maria.  The art of the deal.  I think that  what we're seeing from President Trump is an attempt to put Cuba back on  their heels and say, this is not going to be so easy to get the resumption  of some kind of relationship with the U.S.  And in order to accelerate that  relationship, you're going to have to make some accommodation, I think  especially in terms of press freedoms.  Treatments of people who are  political opponents of the Castro regime.</p><p>They want to see that before they're willing to allow the U.S., for  example, to travel that you spoke about.  The U.S. citizens to travel  easily to Cuba to infuse money into the Cuban economy.</p><p>CORTES:  Juan, Steve Cortes here.  To look at the political angle to this  during the campaign, of course, we all heard that Florida was going to be  the toss-up state.  It turns out it wasn't all that hard for Trump to win.   One of the reasons is he did exceedingly well among Cuban-American voters  in south Florida.  So, do you think this is important politically as a  promised kept to those Cuban voters who supported him?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wow, that's a tough one.  I'll tell you why it's a tough one.   Yes.  He won in that Cuban community and again was a surprise to many  people given some of the comments he had about immigrants.  But not a  surprise among older Cubans who really have retain that anger at what  happened way back with the Castro, with Fidel Castro, in particular.</p><p>So the question is about younger Cubans who would really think the policy  that we had in place for 50 plus years did not lead to the erosion of the  communist state in their country.  It didn't improve conditions for people  living in Cuba.  Maybe this was a different step in terms of what the Obama  administration try to put in place.</p><p>But I think in terms of that older generation, you're exactly right.  I  think they would see this is a promise kept.  I'm not sure that President  Trump going to be faired to him, is going all the way back.  So we'll see  how this works out.</p><p>I do think it's about the deal making and about getting the new Castro,  Fidel's brother, Raul, to say I'm going to come to the table and try to  give you some of what you're seeking in terms of more democratic attitudes  and more economic freedoms that's especially important for American  businesses.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And in terms of American businesses, Juan, it's not that much of  a hardship that Trump does this.  We've seen a lot of the airlines, for  example, reducing and cutting the flights to keep up because the demand  from American tourist just has not materialized.  Not in the way that they  expected.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  That's right.  But I think that what you're hoping to see is in  fact that as American business goes in there, as they develop the resorts  potentially casinos and the like, I mean, that's what Cuba was famous for  in the day.  Dagen, you're still young.  But I think that's what they were  hoping for.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have a collection of glasses and trinkets from those old  casinos before the revolution because you can buy them from people who fled  to Miami from Cuba.  So you can preach but I know what you're talking  about.  And I'm older than you think.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, I don't think so.  Anyway, but I mean, when you start to  think about the potential there for tourism, I think it's a pretty much  very strong everything from the cigars to the rum and the like and just the  life.  So I think that's what American business was hoping for.  In fact,  at one point President Trump was hoping to develop some resorts, golf  courses in Cuba while he was in the private business.</p><p>So I think that's still there.  But you're right, the immediate kind of  tourism that the bump that the airlines was expecting has not materialized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about immigration in general.  The Trump  administration is scrapping another Obama era policy.  This one protecting  undocumented parents.  The administration says it's going to and the  deferred deportation fund of undocumented parents of children who are  American citizens or legal residents.  The decision does not affect another  Obama era program for children brought to the U.S. illegally.  What's your  reaction?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, that's a tough one.  I think again, you could put it under  the rubric of promises kept, in terms of cracking down on immigration.  But  wow, I think this hurts families, so I think you're going to get a lot of  kickback on this.  I don't think it helps him with the immigrant community  or with people who are looking for him to make a special exception for  those DACA children that you just described.  Children who were maybe  brought here as young people potentially against their will and who have  grown up here.  Have totally American identity.  When you start to break up  families, I do think it plays into the hand of the critics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Juan, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching what  takes place this weekend.  Juan Williams joining us in New York.  Good to  see you, sir.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Enjoy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, a mega merger scores antitrust -- a mega merger  scores antitrust approval, but there's a catch.  The condition is in place  for the multi- billion-dollar Dow-DuPont deal.</p><p>Plus, brewing up big bucks of Wisconsin.  I'll sit down with the president  of Leinenkugel Brewing to talk about the beer maker's explosive growth in  recent years.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin for the 117t U.S. Open.  Tee offs  beginning momentarily, actually.</p><p>We are watching the technology sector this morning.  Amazon reportedly  eying an acquisition.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange with details.  Nicole, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, we're looking  at Slack.  This is a chat room company and they'd been raising money and  raising interest among many companies including Amazon.  Will Amazon step  up and pay $9 billion for Slack?  This is a chat room type company.  You  could see Amazon stock 968.94 is up about a half of one percent.  It could  go for about $9 billion.</p><p>Recode also noting that some of the others are interested.  Microsoft,  Salesforce, Google.  And the analysts are saying that this -- if they were  to get Slack would really give Amazon a collaboration with the coworkers so  that they can chat among the coworkers around the globe and give them the  edge.  So we'll see whether or not that happens.</p><p>Then we're moving on to Dow and DuPont.  So that move is toward to win the  U.S. antitrust approval with some conditions.  That's the catch.  Because  there are some conditions here in order to make it go through.  The  companies have to agree now to sell, crop protection products as well as  some of the other assets.  And by doing that, that would then prevent hikes  or other things in the industry that people don't want to see.  And also  keep innovation alive.  So we're going to watch for that.</p><p>I will also note that while they got U.S. approval -- for the antitrust  approval, they still have to get some approval in Canada and Mexico but  have done so far in Europe and China.</p><p>And it just joins the whole farming industry.  There's Dow and DuPont,  buyer in Monsanto, ChemChina and Syngenta and part I should -- that maybe  planning a merger.  So things are in the works in this particular industry.   Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch that, Nicole.  Thanks so much.   Nicole Petallides on Wall Street.</p><p>Let's talk about this Dow-DuPont merger and we may or may not see.  They're  going to have to make some confessions, Steve.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  By the way too also, I think good news in general that I  think mergers are generally strong and heating up.  That's generally a good  sign for the stock market, good sign for the economy at large.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is going to be a behemoth company.  And we were waiting  for what the antitrust folks would say about it.</p><p>CORTES:  Well, you're right.  This is so big.  This is a unique merger in  that regard and there's so many policy implications and there's going to be  so much government oversight of it.  And I'm not smart enough lawyer to  know where that shakes out at the end and what they have to sell off or  what business they have to get out of.</p><p>But I think what's important as an investor is just to know that mergers  are strong in the M&amp;A business, Mergers and Acquisitions are strong.  I  think that's a good sign of optimism for the future.  If we get this tax  package done, which I believe we're going to, I think we are going to see  both the real economy and the stock market soar for the rest of 2017 and in  2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does this also speak to a friendlier administration and a  friendlier FTC in relation to approving these kinds of mergers?</p><p>CORTES:  Dagen, that's a great point.  Because they may not even try this,  right?  Let's say Hillary Clinton won and I say this is just a nonstarter.   Let's not even go down that road.  So I think we certainly have an  administration in the White House right now who is business friendly, who  knows that if we need employment -- if we're going to have employment,  really accelerate, not the kind of tepid employment gains that we've seen  lately.  We have to be pro-employer.</p><p>And part of that is the regulatory framework, the regulatory burden on  American business, both large and small has been onerous, far too heavy,  far too heavy-handed.  And I think once we unleash -- I really view the  American economy right now like a runner that's doing it's best to run, but  we're in a way to invest.  Once we think that way and vest off, I think  this economy is going to just soar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about what we're seeing in markets.  I spoke to  really who I think is one of the smartest guys out there on Wall Street.   He just said, it's going to be hard for the market to get another leg up  significantly higher without the same stocks.  That is Facebook, Amazon,  Google, Alphabet the tech stocks that have been on fire.  And are we going  to see this market wait to see them stabilized?  Because they've been  really rolling over certainly.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  No, Maria.  Listen, I certainly hear that.  I think though  the roll over recently.  We need to put in context in a context of the  rally they had since the election that the roll over isn't that  significant.  Now, you bought these stocks couple weeks ago, you're having  a tough time.  If you bought it last summer, you're still doing fabulous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But maybe we're seeing a rotation.  It's a financials into  elsewhere.</p><p>CORTES:  In energy, I think.  Personally.  I think those two --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give tech a break.</p><p>CORTES:  Those two places.  Exactly.  Tech has been -- and one of the  things that have worried me about the rally.  I'm constructive on the stock  market.  But one thing that has worried me is it's been a little too narrow  for my liking.  A few tech names have really dominated the rally.  I think  it would actually be healthier for the overall market and frankly for the  economy, if we saw a broader rally.  If we involve financials and energy.   I believe energy is going to get better from here.  So to me, it's not so  much market direction as it is.  Rotation, I think will be the game.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one positive sign at least this week is you have the NASDAQ  as poised to decline for the week.  Also the Russell 2000 and small  companies.  But the transports are up.  Of the five kind of major market  gauges including the Dow and the S&amp;P, that one is up more than any other.   It's almost up 0.9 percent.  That's not a huge gain.  But again, it's  always very often a sign of an economy that looks OK.  If people are  betting on the transport.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When the industrials and the transport move together for sure.</p><p>Let me ask you.  You mentioned tax reform.  We talk about this every  morning.  And we're waiting.  We know the markets are waiting.  Do you  still think they can get this done?  What do we have?  Twenty days, twenty- five days?  In terms of when these guys are in office.</p><p>CORTES:  I don't want to sound like Pollyanna.  Okay.  But I do believe  we're going to get enough.  Having said that, I will also say the congress  should not go on recess until this gets done.  And I firmly believe that  and I hope the people, I hope there's an uproar from the American people  telling congress.  They take all of August off.  All of it.</p><p>I mean, what Americans takes all August off?  I sure don't, you don't.  The  congress shouldn't.  Unless they things done first which is the two primary  ones are tax reform and health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think healthcare is going to have an imminently.  And if they  get health care done imminently, they actually do have a shot to get tax  reform done.</p><p>CORTES:  I remain convinced that we're going to get it done.  When I talk  to my friends in the Trump campaign, many of whom are now in the White  House.  They tell me, a lot is going on behind the scenes.  While the  mainstream media is focused on ridiculous Russia allegations and while the  democrats are focused on made-up stories of collusion, there's a lot going  on between the White House and Hill republicans in terms of serious  negotiations to get this done.</p><p>And by the way, if we do, I think all the rest of that becomes just noise.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are a lot of republican senators who are already  talking about not getting on board with the republican health care bill  coming out of the senate.  Lisa Murkowski, Mike Lee, Rand Paul.  The list  continuous to grow.  And it's a very narrow margin of victory in the senate  for that.</p><p>CORTES:  No, it's not going to be easy.  And I'll say this too.  If we  don't get it done, I think we're going to be in a lot of trouble in 2018.   And we will deserve those problems in 2018.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why I think they're going to get it done.  Come hell  or high water.  We'll see.</p><p>Still ahead, bottling up success.  How Wisconsin's Leinenkugel Brewing  Company turned the craft beer trend into big bucks for the home state?   Back in a moment.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Erin Hills in the U.S. Open.  Nothing says  Wisconsin like beer and Leinenkugel has been brewing in the Badger State  for 150 years.  Joining us right now is Dick Leinenkugel, president of the  Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company.  Dick, that's quite a milestone.   Congratulations to you.</p><p>DICK LEINENKUGEL, PRESIDENT, JACOB LEINENKUGEL BREWING COMPANY:  Well,  we're really humbled and I'm humbled to be in the chair guiding our company  now in its sixth generation of 150 years of brewing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that?  Do you look to change in terms of growth  or do you try to keep it as it was from the beginning?  How do you lead a  company that's 150 years old?  You want to keep some things, I guess the  way they are.  I know it always has been but you just want to grow  differently.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  I think you grow up in the business.  Being part of the  family.  Our great-great-grandfather started brewing beer in 1867 in  Chippewa Falls for the thirsty lumberjacks that were milling the way  playing lumber to build the great city of Chicago.</p><p>So it's now through five generations.  The government tried to put us out  of business in 1918 but we survived that by making soda pop.  Came out of  probation, the third generation, fourth generation.  My father led the  company for over 40 years.  My brother for 25 years and now I'm in the  chair and we have just a great team of employees in Chippewa Falls,  Wisconsin and the world's best brew master's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a proud history.  Terrific.</p><p>CORTES:  So 30 years ago, I guess the business was sold, is that correct?</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  So my dad and his cousins have both decided to join up  with Miller Brewing Company at the time.  A well-respected Wisconsin  Brewer, 30 years ago.  So, yes.</p><p>CORTES:  Tell me though.  But it sounds like still a lot of autonomy.  I  mean, it sounds like Leinenkugel is still truly its own businesses within  this very large organization most of all.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  And I think that's really why we've been able to thrive is  that the family has guided the business.  But using the resources of Miller  Brewing Company, the MillerCoors now.  Part of the MillerCoors global  network.  So it's really something that we've been able to maintain that  autonomy, our own brewing in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.  Been able to grow  the business with their help.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Talk about beer innovations.  Again, I actually, off-camera,  tasted the summer shandy and I can say that it's 6:40 in the morning, It's  a delicious breakfast beer.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  Yes.  It's absolutely fabulous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think 5:00 somewhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I did 5:00 A.M.  I didn't drink one of the hot beers.  I didn't  have the whole thing.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  SO summer shandy is available on the course here at Erin  Hills.  And what a refreshing beer.  So it's beer mixed with lemonade.  And  we were the first to bring this down to the United States back in 2007.   And we've been growing the business ever since.  And now in five months, we  brew more summer shandy than all of our other beers combined.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds incredible with lemonade.  You're also celebrating  the anniversary with a special beer.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  We are.  So we collaborated with Hofbrau.  So think of this.   A German brewery with 400 years of brewing experience.  Our brewery with  150 years of brewing experience collaborated on a special German Marzen  style beer to celebrate our 150th anniversary.  So it's a fabulous beer.   It's just available now in six packs starting on draft.  And it's going to  be just a wonderful beer to celebrate our 150 years of brewing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  What are your plans in terms of further expansion?</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  Well, we're expanding our brewery in Milwaukee to add more  brewing capacity and more brewing capability and we certainly want to  continue to grow.  First and foremost, we're all about delighting our beer  drinkers and I think by delighting our beer drinkers, that's how we  continue to grow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Can you go through -- I mean, beer versus Ale.  When  you have more wheat in one.  Give us the different ales if you will in  terms of the beer category.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  So there's two kinds of beer.  And you're saying, well, what  do you mean?  There's 500, 1,000 different kinds of IPAs.  No.  There's  only two kinds of beer.  There's lagers and there are ales.  And it all has  to do about the yeast strain.  So lagers are coal fermented.  And for a  longer period of time, ales are used with a different fermentation and  they're a little bit more at a quicker period of time.  They're a little  bit more fruity and estuary where ales are -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are they lighter?  Is an ale lighter?</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  Ale is no.  Not necessarily.  It all depends on the style  within the lager or the ales.  But there's really only two kinds of beer.   So think of it that way.  And it all has to do with the yeast strain.  But  there's a lot of innovation in the beer market today.  We do mostly lager- style beers which are aged, cold-stored for a little bit smoother flavor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Thank you for that.  Real quick on Trump's policies.   Do you feel like tax reform is going to make a big difference in terms of  growth strategy?</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  You know that we're a heavily taxed industry right now and  have been for many years.  But I think that the best thing that I can  continue to do is to brew great beer that are beer drinkers are going to  choose.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick, great to have you on the show today.</p><p>LEINENKUGEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dick Leinenkugel joining us here.</p><p>Breaking news.

Thank you so much for joining us  here in Erin Hills in Wisconsin, it is Friday, June 16th.  Your top stories  right now, 8:00 am on the East Coast.  With the breaking news this morning,  the leader of ISIS reportedly killed.  The associated press reporting that  Russia is claiming that it killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an air strike in  Syria about a month ago.  At this point, the U.S. military cannot confirm  this news.</p><p>We are waiting on more confirmation.  We are looking at what it means for  the war on terrorism straight ahead.  A show of unity at the congressional  baseball game last night, both teams coming together for a prayer for their  colleague Congressman Steve Scalise ahead of the first pitch.  And  President Trump praised lawmakers in a video message right before the game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In Washington, we have our  disagreements.  But we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we  love.  And the people who call it home.  That's the source of unity and  more than ever we must embrace it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the unity we short-lived unfortunately House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi already back at it attacking Republicans this morning,  blaming Republicans for the (INAUDIBLE) in politics.  What she said coming  up.  President Trump on defensive this morning.  He just tweeted on the  Russia investigation saying this, quote, After 7 months of investigations  and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\" nobody has been  able to show any proof.  Sad!  We'll have more on that coming up as  president tweets about Russia.  And health care battle rages on Capitol  Hill.  Why conservatives are growing concerned about the state of the  senate's bill.</p><p>Billions in liabilities on faulty airbags could bring down Takata.  The  company behind the biggest auto recall in U.S. history may be preparing for  bankruptcy now.  The details next.  And the drama over Bernie Madoff not  going away.  New scrutiny this morning over the compensation fund for his  victims and why it hasn't been paid out yet.  Futures are indicating a gain  at the opening of trading this morning.  Take a look at markets futures  indicating gain of about 15 points on the Dow, five points on NASDAQ, the  market is off from the best levels of the morning right now.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are still higher.  Take a look at the Eurozone indices  here.  And you see the FT 100 and the CAC quarante up about two-thirds of  one percent and the DAX Index in German up a quarter of a percent.  Markets  in Asia overnight finished mixed.  As you'll see here best performer was  Japan of 1/2 of one percent.  And it is day two of U.S. Open, it is getting  under way.

Big hour ahead you don't want to miss a  moment of it.</p><p>First off, breaking news President Trump just tweeted this, and he is  talking about the Russia probe this morning, \"After seven months of  investigations and committee hearings about my \"collusion with Russians,\"  nobody has been able to show any proof.  Sad!\"  says the president.  Adam  Shapiro was live at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam,  good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS:  And good morning to you, Maria.  The  administration points out as well, that it was James Comey who told the  president three times, that he was not a part of the investigation  regarding Russia and then just late last night, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy  attorney general put out a statement, an official DOJ statement saying that  Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories  attributed to anonymous officials.</p><p>So the administration is standing up for the president and fighting back on  some of these stories but the other news that is gaining attention here at  the White House, this morning, has to do with what you were reporting about  Russia's claim that they killed that ISIS leader and his name Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, they say was killed on May 28 during a Russian attack on a  meeting of ISIS leaders in Raqqa, Syria.  Now, they say that this took  place during the meeting and that they also killed 30 mid-level militant  leaders and about 300 fighters, the U.S. military cannot confirm that al- Baghdadi was actually killed and there have been reports over years that he  was killed but if it is true, official say this would be a big blow to ISIS  which is on the run in both Iraq and Syria.</p><p>The other headlines which are grabbing attention at the White House have to  do with vote in the Senate yesterday, in which the senate voted 97 to two  to approve new sanctions against Russia.  Very simply these sanctions would  be against Russia's mining and minerals sector as well as energy sector.   It would have consequences for countries in Europe like Germany because it  would go after companies which invest in Russian organizations.</p><p>Now, there was a statement by Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary who  said and this is a quote, \"The administration is committed to existing  sanctions against Russia and will keep them in place until Moscow fully  honors its commitment to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.\"  \"We believe the  existing executive branch sanctions regime is the best tool for compelling  Russia to fulfill its commitments.\"  The Senate enacted these sanctions,  although, they're not official just yet as retribution for Russia's  interferences with the 2016 elections and of course its annexation of  Crimea.  This still needs to be voted upon in the House and then get  President Trump's signature.  It's a long road ahead if these sanctions are  to become law.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam, we'll be watching that.  Thank you so much.   Adam Shapiro with the latest there, he's at the White House.  Meanwhile, a  show of unity at the congressional baseball game last night.  Both teams  coming together for a prayer for their colleague.  Congressman Steve  Scalise ahead of the first pitch last night.  Here is what Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi had to say on her weekly news conference yesterday just before  the baseball game.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  When the president says  \"I can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care\", when you have  somebody say \"beat them up and I'll pay their legal fees\", when you have  all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so  sanctimonious is something that I really am almost sad that I had to go  down this path with you because I don't think it's appropriate for us to  have the fullest discussion of it.  It will be for another day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there goes the unity that was short lived.  Joining us  right now is Texas Republican Congressman, Brian Babin.  Congressman, your  reaction to Nancy Pelosi's comments there.</p><p>REP. BRIAN BABIN, (R) TEXAS:  I am not surprised, Maria, not surprised  whatsoever.  I listened to her 20-minute-long speech on the floor the other  day and I could only hope that that was sincere but when you look at the --  for instance to some of her commencement speeches to graduating college  seniors over the past few months has been divide, divide, divide, you know,  and I'm not just blaming her, it's the left in general.  They lost the  election.</p><p>They're demonizing us in our policies, they can demonize our policies but  don't demonize us and that's kind of what ginned up this whole thing and  again, the oil needs to be poured on the waters but it's got to be from  both sides, and as we saw, calling us sanctimonious after one of our  leaders was shot on a baseball field for a charity game, it is pretty low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are you going to do about it though?  I mean, you guys  have to get it an agenda executed.  I mean, let's talk health care reform  for a second, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that some Republicans  are also pushing back in terms of getting a health care reform done so it's  not just the division between the Republicans and the Democrats but  division between the Republicans, are you concerned over the senate's new  bill to replace Obamacare?  We're all wondering where it is, what it says.   Critics are saying that the plan doesn't do enough to reduce health care  premiums and you need democratic support and you're not getting it because  of this division.</p><p>BABIN:  Well we're never going to get Democratic support on this, Maria,  there's just no way.  They're determined to, you know -- to stick with a --  with a ship that sinking Obamacare.  But yes, I am concerned that we may  get a bill but it's going to take a lot of rehashing.  We will have to go  to conference on this thing.  We've got to get these premiums down, we've  got to do this thing right, you -- I was a no initially on the original  proposal in the house, I did get some great concessions to me from --  personally from the president, a personal phone call which got me to a yes  and we held out and we got a bill, we got one through, and now, it's up to  the Senate.</p><p>I'm talking to some of my Texas Senate colleagues and they're confident we  are going to get a bill out, what's going to be in it, I have no clue but  we better get it right and we better get it -- get these premiums down, and  we absolutely have to replace this spiraling downward Obamacare plan which  is not going to be with us a whole lot longer.</p><p>CORTES:  Congressman, Steve Cortes here, you know, over the -- until Labor  Day, so, you know, roughly 10 weeks or so, I think the Congress is only  going to be working 22 days or so, something like that, most Americans are  working a hack of lot more than that.  If you don't get tax reform done if  you don't get tax cuts done should the Congress stay in session and not  take its August recess?</p><p>BABIN:  I am in favor of that a one hundred percent.  If we can be useful  up here, if we can vote on some things that absolutely need to be done,  again, the Trump and the Republican conservative agenda has to be delivered  to the American people, that is why we were elected, that's why we won the  presidency --</p><p>CORTES:  And that, Congressman --</p><p>BABIN:  -- and if we don't get it done I think there's going to be a hell  to pay in the 2018 of the midterm elections, so we've got to get this done,  we need tax reform, regulatory reform and we've got to get past health care  reform and repeal and replace Obamacare first.  Absolutely.  You are right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, how is -- it's Dagen McDowell, how is it that some  of your colleagues over on the Senate side are making -- seeming to make  the same mistake that the Democrats did in terms of their crafting this  bill behind closed doors and a lot of fellow Republicans senators have not  seen it and they don't know what's in it and you guys over in the house  certainly don't at this point.</p><p>BABIN:  We have no clue.  As I said a while ago I don't know what if we're  going to wind up saying but -- I mean, I am apprehensive about that, Dagen.   I think it needs to be an open process, I think had it been a more open  process in the house it wouldn't have been a two month dragged out deal the  way it was.  And so I wish that they would look and profit from the  mistakes that we made over in the house, but we did it and we got our job  done, it wasn't a perfect bill.</p><p>I think it was absolutely more conservative at the time that I got to a yes  rather than later as we waited for several weeks, even a month or two.  It  became a less conservative bill in my opinion but nevertheless, I voted for  it.  We -- that was the promise we made for the American people to repeal  this terrible bill, which is destroying the health care industry in our  country.  And as a -- as a -- as a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can you teach --</p><p>BABIN:  As a health care provider myself I can tell you that Obamacare was  absolutely destroying the doctor-patient relationship.  And our bill would  replace that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Congressman, you keep saying, \"We've got to get  this done, we've got to get this done,\" but realistically speaking, do you  see that path?  I mean, you've got to get health care done really quickly,  so I assume you'll accept whatever the Senate comes up with, but do you  think you can get health care on a very short term timeline and then come  back from the summer and do tax reform, is that what you're saying?  I  mean, what is the path?  Because as Steve just said you've got 22 days.</p><p>BABIN:  You're exactly right, Maria and, you know, I can't -- I can't say  or even predict what we are going to get and I can't tell you that I'm  going to support whatever comes out of the Senate.  We're going to have to  make sure that it is something that'll put the average Americans back in  the saddle in controlling their own health care policies and get these  premiums deductibles down so that we will -- we will go back to conference  on -- depending on what they finally wind up passing.</p><p>But I will tell you this, if the Senate would dispense with this 60-vote  rule, the filibuster rule we would get a whale of a lot of our agenda  accomplished but being dependent on getting eight Democrats to vote with us  on every issue that comes right to the Senate, well, the thing about it  that gives a veto power to Nancy Pelosi and to Chuck Schumer and it really  shouldn't happen.  We won't have Judge Gorsuch right now had we not done  so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman, good to have you on the program.   We'll be watching.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BABIN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Brian Babin.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Shares of Takata has been suspended in Tokyo.   Ahead of expected bankruptcy filing.  Lauren Simonetti with the details in  New York.  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FIELD PRODUCER:  Certainly a story  that we're watching, Maria.  Takata facing billions of dollars in  liabilities after its defective airbags led to the biggest safety recall in  automotive history linked to at least a dozen debts and over one hundred  injuries worldwide.  Takata had said to be in talks about a potential deal  with a key -- with key safety systems that the U.S. auto parts maker.   Well, there's growing criticism in how the Bernie Madoff compensation fund  is being handled.</p><p>The Justice Department settlement fund has four billion dollars year marked  for the victims but no one has been paid a cent since the fund was created  four years ago.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a  congressional panel this week he will look into why it has taken so long  for money to reach thousands of investors who took losses in Madoff's Ponzi  scheme.  Well, guess this, Illinois will no longer sell tickets for Mega  Millions or Powerball after June 30th if there is no state budget.</p><p>Illinois lawmakers have been unable to pass the budget for more than two  years now.  The governor has called a special session of legislature to  come up with a budget deal but a lot of spokesperson said, Powerball would  be suspended after the June 28th drawing and Mega Millions after the June  30th drawing if a budget deal is not reached.  And this I'm not making up,  many Americans think we live in a Willy Wonka world survey a real survey  commissioned by the National Dairy Council, seven percent of us believe  chocolate milk comes from chocolate colored cows.</p><p>That appears like a small number but it amounts to 16 or 17 million  citizens.  Forty-eight percent of adults surveyed admitted to not being  sure of where chocolate milk comes from.  The refrigerator, Maria comes  from the refrigerator.  I mean, really?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  See you later.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go figure.  Thanks, Lauren.  Coming up, when it comes to made  in America, Harley-Davidson is at the front of the pack.  We'll talk to the  CEO of the motorcycle giant about how they're embracing President Trump's  American made initiatives and then the biggest names in golf teeing off at  the U.S. Open this morning.  Who is at top of the standings after an  exciting start for the tournament, we'll bring it to you next live from  Erin Hills.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live this morning from  beautiful Erin Hills for the 117th U.S. Open this morning here in  Wisconsin.  The second round of the U.S. Open tees off in minutes.  Jared  Max joining is joining us now for a look at what happened yesterday.   Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  U.S. Open  traditionally humbling to golf scorers even for the best players in the  world but yesterday 29 players shot under par, in fact, 17 recorded scores  of 3 under or better.  Nobody was better than 28-year-old Californian  Rickie Fowler.  Fowler has never won a major tournament but he has a one- shot lead entering today's second round.  He hit the string of three  straight birdies yesterday, seven birdies, and all no bogeys finished 7  under and that's tied for lowest score in relation to par ever in the first  round at the U.S. Open.</p><p>Rough day for defending champion, Dustin Johnson, the emphasis on rough,  fescue shot.  A 75, 3 over tied for 102nd.  Jordan Spieth didn't have  banner first round either, he struggled on the greens.  Finished at 1 over  and Jason Day, tough day as well.  Close encounter with the fescue at Erin  Hills.  He tripled bogeyed, the fourth hole and finished at 7 over par.  So  let's take a look at how the leaderboard shapes up now as round two just  getting under way.</p><p>Rickie Fowler your leader by one over Paul Casey, and American Xander  Schauffele, also Jordan Spieth, you see that plus one Dustin Johnson at 3  over and Rory McIlroy plus 6, not so easy to hit those fair waze, is it,  Rory?  Time for baseball highlights and not home runs images but rather  images of stellar defense yesterday who made a more spectacular catch  Thursday.  Trevor Story of the Colorado Rockies or Didi Gregorius of the  New York Yankees.</p><p>Let's start with Trevor Story.  Colorado was up, 3-1 on San Francisco,  Denard Span pops it up, watch Trevor Story here, beautiful catch, diving to  make the grab.  Trevor Story comes up with the help of Rockies win the game  10-9.  They lead the NL West by one game.  Nice grab.  Meanwhile, the New  York Yankees' Didi Gregorius last night with an amazing catch for Didi  Gregorius looked somewhat like Willie Mays.  I mean, catch better won goes  to Willie Mays, it goes to Didi Gregorious.</p><p>It looks like we don't have that.  And the Golden State following their  second NBA Championship the last three seasons, the Warriors parted ways  parting with their fans yesterday during a parade and rally in downtown  Oakland.  Draymond Green of the Warriors had fun of the Cavaliers' expense  that, you know, the Cavaliers play at Quicken Loans Arena.  They call it  The Q, well, they got to see their finals opponent take a shot at how short  the series was.  Draymond Green wore a T-shirt with a big Q, only said  quickie since the Warriors won a quickie in five games.  Green also took a  shot at LeBron James because LeBron, remember, ditched Cleveland for Miami,  well, and what about super teams.  Listen to what he said yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DRAYMOND GREEN, GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS:  I don't want to talk about super  teams this, super team that.  I never played on a super team, you started  the super team, bro.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  And look at that, Maria.  A shot at LeBron James.  Remember, he left  Cleveland, was criticized because he went to Miami and said, \"Hey, I can't  win a championship without these superstars and now, I got superstars and  now, they're criticizing the Warriors for doing the same thing.  Maria, I  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have it scripted.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, incredible.  You know what, Jared, great stuff.  We're  actually all focused right now on what we have on set, we have the U.S.  Open Championship trophy right here and it's absolutely spectacular.  I  mean, this is -- Dagen, let's talk about it.  It's all sterling silver?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it's pure sterling silver.  It weighs eight and a half  pounds.  This trophy dates back to 1947.  The original trophy was lost in a  clubhouse fire the year prior to that, so in '46, the trophy was lost in a  fire, so this one goes back to 1947, and you look at the names and just  look at the names that are engraved on the side of it, 65 Gary Player.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of the names are engraved.  It's absolutely -- and the back  here --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Billy Casper, '67, Jack Nicklaus.  If you look at the top five  golfers who've won the most U.S. Opens, Nicklaus is in the top five.  I  think that he is third.  They are no -- Tiger Woods I believe is fifth but  there are no golfers currently on the tour who ranked among golfers who won  the most U.S. Opens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, they don't keep this forever, right?  What's the -- what's  the scoop?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Keep it for a year.  They get to keep it for a year.  They do  get -- they do get a keepsake that they don't have to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CORTES:  They do get also one interesting trivia so it wouldn't be this one  but the previous one in 1898, I forget the guy's name but whoever won it  was apparently a very heavy drinker, they were worry that he would hack it  for drinking money, had to put it -- he had a cool story, he had to put on  a deposit to keep it for the year --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p>CORTES:  -- but they keep -- and also interesting, when you look at the  names on here, I don't know, the viewers probably can't see it but one  thing you certainly notice is a very few repeats, only two people have ever  won twice in a row and after DJ started yesterday it seems like probably  not going to happen again this year.  We're going to have a new winner, it  looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and just think the way it's engraved, it's so beautiful.   I don't even want to touch it, it's so gorgeous.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they told me I wasn't allowed to touch it --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, then I won't try to --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just -- because I break things, so I  have to keep my -- it has a restraining order against me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely beautiful.  Sterling silver, the trophy right  here and somebody's going to be walking home with that on this tournament  and keeping it a for a year.  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting,  here is what he say in this morning, \"The Fake News Media hates when I use  what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media.  Over 100 million  people I can go around them.\"  He is fired up this morning, Steve Cortes.</p><p>CORTES:  You know, listen, make tweeting great again.  It was -- I'm going  to defend the president on this.  I love that he tweets and even a lot of  people who like him and who support him say, \"Gosh, I wish he'd hold back  on the Twitter,\" I think this is so important that number one, he can  connect directly with the American people, there's no mediators anymore,  but I think the secondly, most of the mainstream media is so utterly  antagonistic toward the president and I frankly don't even think that's  really very debatable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CORTES:  And the amount of fake news that's put out about him, one just  recent example, Washington Post saying that Comey asked for more money and  then he was -- for the Russian investigation and that's why he was fired.   Completely false --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p>CORTES:  -- utterly, utterly false --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will --</p><p>CORTES:  -- so the president has to go directly to the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's what he's doing.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, Kroger getting clobbered.  The grocery store giant shares of  plummeting this morning after putting lower profits.  How the company plans  to turn that around.

We've got all the gifts you want to know about.  We are live here in  beautiful Erin Hills in Wisconsin, for the 117th U.S. Open, of course, one  of the staples of the state is Harley-Davidson the legendary motorcycle  brand was founded in Milwaukee Wisconsin back in 1903, I am sporting a hot  Harley jacket right now.  A wardrobe change as we welcome the CEO of  Harley- Davidson, Matthew Levatich joining us here, Matt great to see you  again.</p><p>MATTHEW LEVATICH, HARLEY-DAVIDSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER:  Nice to see  you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, thank you very much.  So  you've been committed to creating jobs in America your name comes up a lot  with President Trump, characterize the jobs market for us what you're  seeing in terms of the broader economy. </p><p>LEVATICH:  Well you know as you mentioned we've been here from the very  beginning 1903, our engine plant is still in Milwaukee and Milwaukee's got  a long and proud history of a lot of not only manufacturing with technology  and development, and so the skilled trades element of what we see in a  workforce is very important.  So far we're having great success with the  employment that we need, the broader economy I think for the company and  for, you know, the United States, for us, is a lot about our opportunities  to grow internationally.  So trade is very important and we're paying a lot  of attention to the trade policies and the trade opportunities that we have  particularly in Asia, which is the world largest motorcycle market are in  Asia, our biggest growth potential, is in Asia and so the trade barriers  trade tariffs are obviously top of mind as we look to pursue those goals. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk about that because when President Trump speaks  about trade he's come up with this idea of a reciprocal tax and I think  it's partly because of your story, because when you sell motorcycles in  India they charge you what a 100 percent or 90 percent?</p><p>LEVATICH:  One hundred percent tariff on a straight import. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A 100 percent tariff to India and you're charge to 90 percent  tariff in China.</p><p>LEVATICH:  Yes, and throughout that region actually the tariffs in the  entire tax structure add a significant amount of burden to the product  before it gets to retail, and that limits our ability to access and reach  those customers we have a lot of passion for Harley in the region, again  their big motorcycle markets their growing and we see opportunity but those  tax and trade barriers are significant for us, as a limitation to that  growth. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This has been one of the most important examples, that  President Trump has discussed your story, the fact that you're selling  motorcycles overseas and they're giving you this huge tariff and were not  putting those kinds of tariffs on their products when they're coming here.   So do you favor something like that, I mean how do you alleviate these 100  percent tariffs if China and India are not going to change their - </p><p>LEVATICH:  Well, you know, the whole trade environment can't be taken in  isolated cases and so it's a very complex issue clearly we are heavily  invested U.S. manufacturer we are exporting our products around the world  90 countries so a direct offset of imported motorcycles is not something  that's easily, sort of, simple, sort of, contained a solution, and you  know, in something like TPP was in negotiation for almost a decade before  it was unfortunately turned down, right?  That would have helped us a lot  we're optimistic the administration understands the issues that we face and  our working on our behalf of as well as on behalf of many here American  companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean isn't it interesting that the biggest markets for you  are in Asia, and this is where they are actually charging they know that  this is a big market for you and they are going to make sure you may up for  it. </p><p>LEVATICH:  Well, that's I guess one interpretation, it is what it is and  we're working every angle that we can, to open those markets, because the  customers are there, they are interested as those economies as disposable  income-leisure time expands, it's a right market for Harley-Davidson our  competitors are there oftentimes without the burdens that we have.  And we  need to find ways to access those markets. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you are obviously an iconic brand, got a loyal following  all around the world.  Tell us about what you're seeing a lot of people  talking about the retail environment being under pressure we saw that from  retail sales we may have seen that even from your earnings I don't know if  that's what you saw.</p><p>LEVATICH:  You know, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market many  people are participating in the economy but they're participating in ways  that are I think easily kind of turned on and turned off their watching to  see sustained and significant momentum in the economy job security income  security those types of things.  So that sort of tempted in this, I think  affects companies like Harley, you know, we're selling a product that is an  aspiration product it's some people dream to have and if they don't have  that kind of security they might hold off and wait.  And I think that's,  that's an aspect of the economy that's still with us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you attract newer generations?</p><p>LEVATICH:  That's very important to us we are fundamentally about riding,  you know, when you look around the beautiful country sided here around Erin  Hills this is where the company was founded this is where I like to come  and ride beautiful rolling hills and scenic roads.  I think our founders  were doing the same thing at the very beginning, it is for us all about  riding, and creating and recreating the passion for motorcycling is really  core to our strategy for the next decade.  So it's not simple thing to do  but just reminding ourselves that we are in the business of riding and to  make sure that we have the full attention of not just we build motorcycles  but we build riders, because we have to invest in our sport and remind  people how awesome it is to be out riding a motorcycle. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you ride your bike here today?</p><p>LEVATICH:  I did not because they would not let me into Erin Hills on a  motorcycle oddly enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>LEVATICH:  You know this golf community I don't know what they're thinking. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly but you sell a lot of other products other than bikes  this jacket for example. </p><p>LEVATICH:  This jacket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is gorgeous your jacket, tell us about the pricing for the  bikes today and what is the range? </p><p>LEVATICH:  We have we cover a range jackets for a lot broader that most  people think you can get into Harley for in this high 6,000, 7,000's, and  then of course we produce motorcycles that are for the aspirational owner  that are kind in the high 30s and obviously there are lot of differences  across that range but we cover that whole price spectrum with Harley- Davidson motorcycles and part of what we need to do is do a better job  informing people that there's something for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially when you something wants custom made you do that. </p><p>LEVATICH:  Yes, we have custom vehicle operations heavily accessorized and  bigger engines, and you know the real ultimate product for the ultimate  passionate customer.  But again we've got a lot of stuff in between, a real  and their all great there are all high impact, really cool looking, for  young adults for women for whomever. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well I -- this is quite cool looking if I say so myself. </p><p>LEVATICH:  You look - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matt great to have you on the show today.</p><p>LEVATICH:  Thanks for appreciating it.  Nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Matthew Levatich is the CEO of Harley- Davidson, we'll take a short break when we come back a wild start to the  U.S. Open Stuart Varney gives us a take on the tournament so far.  And then  Amazon patents hypocrisy, why the company wants to stop customers from  comparing prices with competitors after revolutionizing the way we prize,  back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back we are coming to you live today from the beautiful  Erin Hills a golf course for 117th U.S. Open this morning, here in  Wisconsin.  Tee-off has begun and we are watching the day begin, welcome  back we are looking at markets this morning, a turning negative here, as  you saw earlier we were looking at a firmer beginning, and that has pretty  much evaporated.  The Dow Industrials now showing a gain at just two  points, Nasdaq is now negative, that's down two points and the S&amp;P 500,  just holding in positive territory by a quarter of a point, so markets have  turned decidedly mixed at this point.  </p><p>The couple of names were watching this morning, Kroger definitely one to  watch in terms of volume and movement the stock of the grocery giant fell  nearly 20 percent yesterday after company cut its full year for earnings  forecast.  Kroger is blaming the move on higher product cost, Kroger shares  right now as you see continuing that slide, down another two percent this  morning.</p><p>We're also watching Amazon, the company has been granted a patent that can  stop in store shopper from comparing prices on their phones.  So when  you're shopping around this technology will allow the store to see what a  shopper is searching for connected to its Wi-Fi.  The store can intake  action like an e-mail or a coupon to suggest the comparable item or it can  even block access to the competitive content. </p><p>so if you are looking for a cheaper price on something, away from Amazon  might not be able to find it while in Amazon store.  Pretty incredible move  from Amazon.  Stock is up today.  Meanwhile, round two will kick off in  Wisconsin for the 117th U.S. Open.</p><p>Joining me right now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney who is a  regular watcher of golf.  Stu, good morning to you. </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  Maria, point  of correction not kickoff in golf, you tee-off.  You blast off, that is you  tee-off.  I want it if possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is kicking off, Stu.  I have been saying that it is tee- off time all morning, but, of course, you have not been watching all  morning. </p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, I have glued. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You really wish you were here. </p><p>VARNEY:  I do, I do, I do.  I want you to make a special point of going  over to Rickie Fowler, congratulating him on being seven under, I think  latest on the board.  I want you to tell him that we miss his fashion  sense.  He used to appear in most outrageous colors, outfits, really stood  out, then all of a sudden he grew up.  I don't know what happened, he  changed and now he's a normal looking golf type guy.  So just have a quick  word with him, Maria, and straighten him out when you get the chance. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, aren't there rules that you are not supposed to wear stuff  like that on the golf course?  I mean, I know in tennis you really have to  stick to the wardrobe rules. </p><p>VARNEY:  Now you are talking about Wimbledon.  It remains white shirt,  white shorts whatever.  I think everybody else is - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are no kinds of rules in golf? VARNEY:  I don't think so.  You can you can't have a Coca-Cola shirt.  You  can't do that at Masters.  I don't know about at U.S. Open.  If Rickie  Fowler wants to arrive in his pantaloons or whatever you want to call them,  that's the one.  If you wanted to arrive looking like that, I'd be cheering  him on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  You know Stu, I have taken golf lessons just so  you know.  I took lessons with best of the best.  I have a shot to show  you, Stuart.  I don't want to get you jealous or anything but Hank Haney  gave me golf tips.  Hank Haney of course, Tiger Woods coach.  He was  showing me how to putt.  Quite exciting. </p><p>VARNEY:  So Maria, without too far on the - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not actually a neophyte in golf as you say.</p><p>VARNEY:  I am not done yet, Maria.  Hold on.  Don't cut my segment short  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not good.  I never said I was good, Stuart.  OK?  I just --  I got lessons and then never played again. </p><p>VARNEY:  I will let you into a secret of mine.  I have only played once and  played nine holes only at the South Hampton Princess in Bermuda.  You know  what my score was for nine holes?  118.  So I quit playing, I caddied and I  watched all the time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good move.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, happy father's day my friend. </p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much indeed, Maria.  And the same to all of you and  your staff right there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you 10 minutes on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\".  Thank you,  Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. right after  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We will take a break then all about father's day,  teeing up the perfect present for dad this father's day.  Taking a look at  best gifts for golf lovers.  But first, a message from a pro at the U.S.  Open. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JORDAN SPEITH, U.S. OPEN WINNER:  Hey, Dad.  I just wanted to drop a note  saying that you mean the world to me.  You are my biggest role model,  somebody I look up to for everything especially off the course.  I don't  look up to you much on the course but I owe a lot to you.  You have been a  tremendous father to me, my brother, and my sister, and a tremendous  husband to mom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPEITH:  I feel very lucky that I have the dad.  He is a tremendous role  model.</p><p>JASON DAY, GOLFER:  Enjoy the moment with your loved ones.  Enjoy the  moment with your kids.  Enjoy the moment with your wife.</p><p>DUSTIN JOHNSON, DEFENDING U.S. OPEN CHAMPION:  It's a special day, so a lot  of times ends on Sunday at the U.S. Open so hopefully, I get to hold that  trophy on father's day.  It would it be nice. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure would be.  We are live from beautiful Erin Hills this  morning in Wisconsin.  We are at the 117th U.S. Open, and you just heard  top tour golfer share why Father's Day this Sunday is so important to them.   The holiday rakes major bucks for retailers.  Americans are expected to  spend a record high $15.5 billion this year, on Father's Day gifts.  I want  to bring in CEO and President of the PGA Tour Superstore, Dick Sullivan is  with us.  Dick, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DICK SULLIVAN, PGA TOUR SUPERSTORE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Maria.  Great to be  here.  I wish I was with you, though.  It looks beautiful out there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We wish you were.  It is gorgeous here, of course, the U.S.  Open is traditionally held during the week of Father's Day.  Tell us how  events are driving sales at your superstore. </p><p>SULLIVAN:  This is a huge week for us actually the biggest week of the  year.  Our number one week, only I think Christmas is number two, so we are  having a great season.  Actually seven and the last eight months, we had  double-digit comp store increases which are significant in brick-and-mortar  retail world.  And our online has tripled those.  This is a huge week for  us.  We got a lot of great gifts, this weekend will be -- this week will  break a record for our company.  This will be the biggest week as I said,  of the year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, you've got great products right here with us.  We're  going to help out last-minute shoppers' check out some of the products that  we have on set.  Get your take on this.  First, we've got a Callaway GBD  Epic Driver. </p><p>SULLIVAN:  This is the newest, hottest driver in the market.  It just came  out January, and it's got new technology they call jailbreak technology,  got titanium in front of the club face, clearly the number one driver.  A  great gift for dad.  We have many of them in our stores so people should  come to our stores and buy them this weekend. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about your range finders.  What is the Bushnell  technology offering?</p><p>SULLIVAN:  It's unbelievable these days.  You can shoot them, and shoot  handle will vibrate.  It's all about distance and accuracy.  They're so  much better than in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes Dagen, what do you got there?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't know.  He can tell us  the number one - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're holding this putter here.  It's got lights on it. </p><p>SULLIVAN:  I can't see what you are looking at.  That tailor-made part -  that's the part that Rory just put into play.  That is one of the hottest  putters clearly.  Jason Day is playing that putter; Sergio won with that  putter at the Masters.  It's heavy as you can see.  It's more stable,  allows for better role.  It's a great putter and those guys playing really  well with it as you see. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jordan Spieth, one of golf's greatest moneymakers his deal with  Under Armour has introduced must-have products on the course.  Does the  store carry anything from Under Armour?</p><p>SULLIVAN:  We carry all the apparel from Under Armour.  We carry shirts,  pants.  This is a new Spieth One shoe.  And golf shoes have come a long  way, not just about the look of the shoe, it is about performance.  These  are very, very lightweight.  These are in stores at $199, another great  gift for dad and these are designed by Jordan.  And worked with Jordan with  team Under Armour.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We came prepared.  Let me ask you about these balls.  Number  one golf ball and then, this ball engineered to perform with every club.   Tell us about these balls. </p><p>SULLIVAN:  Well, the titlist is the number one gift in the store for sure.   It's the number one ball played in all the tours, there is more pros  playing Titlist Pro V1 than any other ball I think combined.  The new ball  is Taylor made TP 5. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much are these balls?</p><p>SULLIVAN:  The golf balls are 47.99 for titlist Pro V, Taylor made ball is  a new ball.  Actually, Justin Rose hit it.  He's getting more height but  getting the same distance so the ball is landing on the green. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazing.  Dick Sullivan, thank you.  Don't miss our live  coverage of the U.S. Open on Fox Sports Go, Fox Sports One, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That will do it for us.

The jobless rate dropped to 3.9 percent, suggesting slack in the labor market, but wages are growing slowly.</p><p>  Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.</p><p>  ''In 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,'' said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson &amp; Company, which manages $48.2 billion. ''There is no gray zone. It's only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.''</p><p>  Who's correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.</p><p>  After all, even before <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.</p><p>  A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country's wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.</p><p>  Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:</p><p>  Diversify Your Portfolio</p><p>  Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia -- none of them has caused a market correction.</p><p>  Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. ''We've seen cash come in to buy on the dips,'' Mr. Crowell said.</p><p>  And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.</p><p>  ''The stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,'' Mr. Crowell said.</p><p>  Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.</p><p>  ''Consumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,'' said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. ''One of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.''</p><p>  Mr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.</p><p>  Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.</p><p>  Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.</p><p>  He cited last week's sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. ''Last week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,'' he said.</p><p>  Be Aware of Opportunities</p><p>  Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.</p><p>  ''When we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn't going to be as much population growth and consumption,'' said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. ''Most of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.''</p><p>  Mr. Roth pointed to the reaction over the flattening of the yield curve, which tracks the difference between the interest rate on short-term bonds and long-term bonds. He said talk about the yield curve inverting -- which means long-term borrowing costs become less than those in the short term -- was premature.</p><p>  ''The strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,'' Mr. Roth said. ''We haven't even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there's significant opportunity right now.''</p><p>  Yet investors need to pay attention. ''The alarm is when the yield curve inverts,'' he said. ''It's a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.''</p><p>  Actively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.</p><p>  Pick Recession-Resistant Stocks</p><p>  Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.</p><p>  For instance, after saying so many harsh things about European trading partners, Mr. Trump embraced <person><nameText>Jean-Claude Juncker, </nameText></person>president of the European Commission, just last week.</p><p>  ''The worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,'' said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.</p><p>  That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.</p><p>  ''The flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he's doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,'' Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.</p><p>  Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.</p><p>  ''You could think of a Google, where people's search habits aren't going to change dramatically if there's a recession and there's already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,'' he said. ''You could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.''</p><p>  The opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.</p><p>  Consider the Tax Implications</p><p>Facebook's loss of nearly 20 percent of its value in one day was substantial. But Mr. Crowell said it should not cause people to run from the Big Tech stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix.</p><p>  What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. ''It's prudent to be mindful that those four names don't define a diversified portfolio,'' he said.</p><p>  Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.</p><p>  Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.</p><p>  ''People don't look at the after-tax returns,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''I've had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, 'Should we stay in or get out?'''</p><p>  If an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.</p><p>  Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.</p><p>  Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Above, Wando Terminal in Charleston, S.C.<person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>left, welcomed <person><nameText>Jean-Claude Juncker, </nameText></person>the president of the European Commission, despite speaking harshly of trading partners in Europe.
