For that matter, no one knew much about social media or search engines in general.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cellphones were still simply mobile, small and expensive telephones. There was no concept of a phone as a handheld computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, five companies - Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google's parent company) - have a collective worth of more than $3 trillion. Yet such transnational companies remain mostly exempt from the sort of regulations and accountability faced by most other industries.</p><p>Major corporations understandably fear product liability laws. Oil companies are hectored by class-action lawsuits and headlinegrabbing attorneys badgering them to pay up for supposed climate change brought on by commuters filling up each week. Tobacco companies have paid out billions of dollars due to cigarettes' contribution to lung cancer. Pharmaceutical corporations are often forced to pay millions in fines when their prescription drugs cause dangerous side effects.</p><p>Yet every year, nearly a half-million Americans are injured in traffic accidents due to distracted driving involving a cellphone. No one knows how many millions of people worldwide are addicted to the apps on their smartphones - a habit that can be harder to break than an opiate addiction and can leave addicted users in a similar zombie-like condition. Yet unlike Big Pharma, Big Oil and Big Tobacco, Big Tech is rarely held responsible for the deleterious effects of its products on millions the world over.</p><p>In most states, public boards and commissions regulate companies that provide public utilities. The theory is that such corporations use public spaces - from power poles to underground pipelines - to serve a captive public domain and provide an essential need. Radio and television stations are likewise regulated by the federal government on the similar assumption that the airwaves are not private property.</p><p>Tech companies such as Google and Facebook are also utilities of sorts that provide essential services. They depend on the free use of public airwaves. Yet they are subject to little oversight; they simply make up their own rules as they go along. Antitrust laws prohibit one corporation from unfairly devouring its competition, capturing most of its market and then price-gouging as it sees fit without fear of competition. Google has all but destroyed its search engine competitors in the same manner that Facebook has driven out competing social media.</p><p>Facebook and Google are now called a \"duopoly.\" The two companies rake in roughly half of all internet ad revenue. Both companies sometimes censor and electronically snoop on their customers, massaging everything from the daily news to what we should buy. Could a Silicon Valley startup company offer an alternative to either Facebook or Google? It would likely be bought out or crushed the moment it became large enough to gain notice.</p><p>Why are huge tech companies seemingly exempt from the rules that older corporations must follow?</p><p>First, their CEOs wisely cultivate the image of hipsters. The public sees them more as aging teenagers in T-shirts, turtlenecks and flip-flops than as updated versions of J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller or other robber barons of the past.</p><p>Second, the tech industry's hierarchy is politically progressive. In brilliant marketing fashion, the Internet, laptops, tablets and smartphones have meshed with the hip youth culture of music, television, the movies, universities and fashion. Think Woodstock rather than Wall Street.</p><p>Corporate spokesmen at companies such as Twitter and YouTube brag about their social awareness, especially on issues such as radical environmentalism, identity politics and feminism. Given that the regulatory deep state is mostly a liberal enterprise, the tech industry is seen as an ally of federal bureaucrats and regulators. Think more of Hollywood, the media and universities than Exxon, General Motors, Koch Industries and Philip Morris.</p><p>Third, the tech industry boasts that it is green and clean. Plastic cords and screens almost magically produce podcasts, videos, email, social media pages and the Internet. Few in the public worry about how lithiumion batteries are made, or where and how their ingredients are mined. Pods and pads do not emit smoke. They require no gas, grease and oil. Smartphones and laptops apparently were spontaneously generated out of the clean air of the cool San Francisco Bay area and will dissolve back into it when they wear out.</p><p>Finally, high tech is an American specialty and a huge earner of foreign exchange. Politicians are understandably afraid of turning a golden goose into a sick hen. Without taxable trillion-dollar revenues from Facebook, Google and Apple, a dysfunctional, cash-strapped California would likely go broke.</p><p>The result is that high tech has become is a brilliant chameleon - invisible in plain sight.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and the author, most recently, of \"The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern\" You can reach him by emailing <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:author@victorhanson.com\">author@victorhanson.com</email></p><p>- Tribune News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-16997E4B16A0EC48</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28985DF53D10B8 NWBKOK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG5-5T71-DXVP-V3PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Lawton Constitution<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In What Way Are They Dominant?</p><p> Since Facebook is the only social network of its kind, Google the only search engine of its kind, Apple the only consumer tech company of its kind and Amazon the only retailer of its kind, they are definitely dominant players. But if you consider their revenue generating streams, they aren't that dominant.Google, for example, continues to see its digital advertising market share shrink. eMarketer says that it's currently under 40% with Facebook just over 20%. Amazon, in spite of being such a late entrant is rapidly gaining share at just under 10%. This market, in spite of everything doesn't feel like a monopoly. So laws protecting privacy etc will impact companies like Twitter TWTR[6], SnapSNAP[7] and PinterestPINS[8] as much as they will big tech.The closed ecosystem, captive users, the 'Apple Tax' and competing new Apple services appear to be an abuse of power. At the same time, developers and users do have other options in Android, although they still won't be able to access iOS users. Then again, Amazon may be the leading online retailer, but it won't be able to hold its position if it charges unreasonably. 2. Does the consumer win or lose? In each case, the companies offer a compelling service that customers flock to, so they provide something of considerable value. If breaking up (or other regulatory action) impacts Google's ability to display the most useful information, or affects Facebook's ability to connect people, or prevents Apple from running a secure platform or prevents Amazon from charging an attractive price, it obviously isn't the answer.However, the time has come when the companies must be evaluated to determine whether their activities prevent or make it unduly difficult for a competing player to enter the market, thereby stifling innovation and limiting consumer choice. 3. Is the Action Appropriate? Regulators will also have to determine whether breaking up, fining, converting to utility or other action will be sufficient to deal with the problem. One might think that allowing users to access services from places other than the app store is an easy solution that Apple should be forced to accept.There's really no strong argument against this. But the cure may not always be as straightforward for the other companies, especially on the issue of privacy because companies are automatically the custodians of a lot of data as a part of the service they provide. A GDPR-like solution may be the answer in this regard.4.What Are the Stakes? The big technology companies have a lot of resources. So huge fines are of no effect because they can comfortably swallow even very large fines and continue as before.On the other hand, they can be made to use resources to set up effective control systems as directed by the government. This would be the best way to deal with both security and privacy concerns. Breaking or crippling them in any way would be a waste of resources, so the government is unlikely to move in that direction.There's also the artificial intelligence consideration. The amount of data these companies have accumulated puts them at the forefront of AI development. It would be remiss of lawmakers to set them back in this respect when it is one of the things.Investor ActionRegulatory action takes years and there's nothing to suggest that the outcome will be unfavorable, especially for the big players with their considerable resources and experience in dealing with antitrust situations. Yes, costs may go up, but any laws that come into being to regulate the environment will be tackled by big tech far easier than by small fry.All four are already trading below their median P/E values over the past year, but only Apple is at a discount to the S...00 as well. Given the pros and cons, Facebook is a Buy (Zacks Rank #2) right now. As far as the others are concerned, it's best to wait for bigger declines before building positions.Or, you can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

Our reforms to digital platforms are world-leading and following a groundbreaking 18-month inquiry by the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission].\" Under the draft laws Facebook and Google could face hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties if they refuse to take part in a government-mandated arbitration process with news providers.</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims, who has been a driving force behind the proposed laws, hit out at Facebook's announcement yesterday, branding its threats \"ill-timed and misconceived,\" and urging the company to \"engage in con-structive discussions\".</p><p>\"The draft media bargaining code aims to ensure Australian news businesses, including independent, community and regional media, can get a seat at the table for fair negotiations with Facebook and Google,\" he said. \"Facebook already pays some media for news content. The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to -Facebook and Google's relat-ionships with Australian news media businesses.\" The ACCC's moves to force Facebook and Google to compensate Australian media outlets for content would set a worldwide precedent.</p><p>Both Facebook and subsidiary Instagram issued alerts to users yesterday saying from October their Terms of Service would change to include: \"We also can remove or restrict -access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory -impacts to Facebook.\" This step would allow Facebook and Instagram to avoid paying for news. Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton claimed news was not a big revenue earner. \"This is not our first choice - it is our last. But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector,\" Mr Easton said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-e8d5ec58ebe711ea8dd92a70328287fc97f9c709bca785466e239c977d012d0c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RG-7RS1-JD3N-51W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"409\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

McKinnon and Emily Glazer   Big Tech will come under the glare of a national spotlight Wednesday, as four of its leaders face questions from members of Congress aiming to rein in what they believe is excessive power in the hands of a few giant companies.    The chief executives -- Amazon.com Inc.'s Jeff Bezos, Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook, Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai -- are set to appear before the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigating the market dominance of online platforms.    Their testimony could help build public pressure for government action, especially if the back-and-forth with lawmakers raises new concerns about the way the big technology companies operate.    \"These platforms have been allowed to run wild and free from really any constraints,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), the subcommittee chairman, said in an interview. \"The responsibility we have is to make clear what the impacts are of the lack of competition in the digital marketplace.\"    For the CEOs, it is a chance to make the case that their success derives not from monopoly power, but from their ability to meet consumer needs.    The four companies declined to comment ahead of the hearing. In the past, they have defended themselves against complaints of market dominance by pointing out that they invest in platforms that help small businesses; face stiff competition, including from one another; and help the economy by employing large U.S. workforces.    All the CEOs except Mr. Bezos have previously appeared before Congress. While it isn't uncommon for executives from an industry to testify together -- big bank leaders did so last year -- it is rarer for a congressional inquiry to come at the zenith of an industry's success. As of Monday, the four companies and Microsoft Corp. represented the five most valuable U.S. companies.    Democrats have generally been most critical of the market power of big technology companies, but some Republicans have also expressed concerns -- including whether existing antitrust laws are outdated in the internet age.    In dealing with rival companies, some tech giants often act in a predatory fashion, said Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.). \"They are doing it in a way that's designed to reduce competition,\" Mr. Buck said in an interview. \"As it appears to me now, there's a need for action and for updating the law.\"    Other Republicans on the subcommittee are more likely to focus on what they view as anticonservative bias among some of the platforms, a charge the companies generally dispute.    Despite the hearing's topic, lawmakers can ask whatever they wish. Both parties have criticized how the companies regulate content on their platforms, with Republicans often charging censorship and many Democrats worried about foreign election interference.    The format of Wednesday's hearing could work to the advantage of the witnesses. They will testify simultaneously rather than individually -- an outcome the companies sought -- which could blunt sustained pressure on one witness.    It will also occur via video-chat because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of a crowded hearing room, the CEOs will testify from a place of their choosing.    At the same time, the hearing comes with the companies under scrutiny by one or more of the authorities empowered to enforce antitrust laws: the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The subcommittee has been running its own yearlong probe and lawmakers have more than one million documents gathered from the companies and their competitors, including the executives' own emails, congressional aides say.    All that could make the questioning feel more like an interrogation. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), who sits on the panel, said members have spent hours in briefings about the companies and might conduct dry runs practicing their questions.    Staffers have told outsiders the hearing could last five hours or more, with each lawmaker having multiple opportunities to ask questions. \"We don't want anyone to feel left out,\" Ms. Jayapal quipped.    The CEOs' preparations have included speaking with lawmakers, as is typical for high-profile hearings. Mr. Cicilline said last week that he had conversations scheduled with Messrs. Zuckerberg, Cook and Pichai.    Matt Perault, a Duke University professor who testified before the subcommittee last year while working at Facebook, recalled preparing with hours of talking-point briefings and mock interrogations. He remembered receiving this advice: \"It's basically impossible to win. You're trying not to lose.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg views the stakes for the hearing as high for himself and for Facebook, and has been preparing with a tight circle of confidants and congressional experts, according to people familiar with the efforts. Among the concerns, these people said, are questions about the potential divestiture of prime assets Instagram and WhatsApp, and about the perception that Facebook lacks the ability to govern its sizable platforms.    Facebook faces multiple antitrust probes focusing in part on its acquisition of potential rivals. None of the investigations appears to be on a fast track, although the FTC is laying the groundwork for depositions of company executives.    Amazon's retail opponents have been lobbying lawmakers to ask Mr. Bezos about counterfeit products, competition with third-party sellers on the Amazon marketplace, and other issues. Mr. Bezos has never previously testified before Congress, and Amazon initially resisted agreeing to let him do so, according to people familiar with the matter.    The company relented after senior lawmakers publicly demanded he testify, citing a Wall Street Journal report in April that Amazon employees used data from the platform's sellers to develop competing products.    The FTC and some U.S. states have met with Amazon critics to discuss its market power, according to people familiar with the matter, but neither the company nor the regulators have disclosed a formal investigation.    The antitrust probes into Alphabet Inc.'s Google are the most advanced, with the Justice Department expected to file suit this summer. Investigators have focused on the company's dominance of online advertising and search, both topics likely to come up Wednesday.    Apple also resisted personal testimony by Mr. Cook, according to a person familiar with the matter. He has sought to distinguish Apple by emphasizing that its business model is less reliant on consumers' personal data.    The Justice Department is probing Apple's App Store practices, people familiar with the matter have said. Rivals say the company acts anticompetitively in the store, extracting unfair payments and favoring its own products. Last week, Apple promoted a study concluding the fees app developers pay are in line with those charged elsewhere.    Earlier public hearings offer clues about evidence lawmakers might use to put the CEOs on the spot. At a January congressional hearing with smaller companies, the founder of mobile-phone accessory maker PopSockets LLC said he had evidence of Amazon bullying third-party sellers.    Columbia University law professor Timothy Wu, who has called for breaking up Facebook, urged the lawmakers last summer to subpoena Mr. Zuckerberg's emails discussing the 2012 acquisition of Instagram -- a request that was among those sent to the company months later.    --Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

The rules will let internet service providers block online content, or charge websites for faster delivery to consumers, by rolling back the protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.</p><p>  Several public interest groups, including Free Press and Public Knowledge, and some start-ups had announced plans to challenge the commission's move weeks ago, but the Internet Association had been undecided about how to respond. Before the commission voted on the repeal, some of America's biggest tech companies, Facebook and Googlein particular, took a back seat during public protests over the issue.</p><p>  On Friday, a day after the commission released the 539-page final rules, the Internet Association said it would join the coming legal case against them.</p><p>  ''The rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,'' Michael Beckerman, the association's chief executive, said on Friday.</p><p>Netflix, whose data-heavy video streams could face extra charges by internet service providers, also said it would support a legal challenge.</p><p>  ''In 2018, the Internet is united in defense of #NetNeutrality. As for the FCC, we will see you in court,'' the company said in a message posted on Twitter.</p><p>  The issue of regulating internet service providers to maintain an open internet has wound through the courts and the commission for more than a decade. The repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, attracted strong opposition.</p><p>  Mr. Pai has said the new rules would encourage more investment and innovation by internet service providers. He has also argued that the change would withstand any legal challenge, as it essentially restores the rules to what they were before 2015.</p><p>  The commission declined to comment on Friday.</p><p>  Democratic lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the commission's action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous bills that could replace the agency's rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States lawmakers in California, New York and Washington are also considering bills that would recreate the 2015 net- neutrality rules in those states.</p><p>  Public interest groups are trying to make net neutrality an issue in this year's midterm elections. They have deployed text and email campaigns meant to pressure lawmakers to support a congressional reversal of the commission's action.</p><p>  ''We'll be going to court soon to challenge the F.C.C. and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,'' said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had ''awakened the public.''</p><p>  The strong response to the repeal has also led to some safety concerns. At the commission meeting where the new rules were approved, law enforcement officials briefly cleared the room to address an unspecified security issue.</p><p>  Mr. Pai canceled a scheduled appearance at the tech industry's CES trade show next week. The commission declined to say why he would not attend, but has previously confirmed that he and his family had recently received threats by phone and email over the net neutrality issue.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Supporters of net neutrality last month in Washington.

The Rules will let Internet Service Providers (ISP) Block Online Content, or Charge Websites for Faster Delivery to Consumers, by Rolling Back the Protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.Several Public Interest groups, including Free Press and Public Knowledge, and some Start-Ups had announced plans to Challenge the Commission's move weeks ago, but the Internet Association had been undecided about how to respond. Before the Commission voted on the Repeal, some of America's biggest Tech companies, Facebook and Google in particular, took a back seat during Public Protests over the issue.On Friday, a day after the Commission released the 539-page Final Rules, the Internet Association said it would join the coming Legal Case against them.'The rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,' Michael Beckerman, the Association's Chief Executive, said on Friday.Netflix, whose Data-heavy Video Streams could face extra charges by ISPs, also said it would support a Legal Challenge. </p><p>'In 2018, the Internet is united in defense of #NetNeutrality. As for the FCC, we will see you in court,' the company said in a message posted on Twitter.The issue of Regulating ISPs to maintain an Open Internet has wound through the Courts and the Commission for more than a decade. The Repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the New Commission Chairman, attracted strong opposition. Pai has said the New Rules would encourage more Investment and Innovation by ISPs. He has also argued that the change would withstand any Legal Challenge, as it essentially Restores the Rules to what they were before 2015.Democratic Lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the Commission's Action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous Bills that could Replace the Agency's Rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States Lawmakers in California, New York, and Washington are also considering Bills that would recreate the 2015 Net-Neutrality Rules in those States.Public Interest Groups are trying to make Net Neutrality an issue in this year's Midterm Elections. They have deployed Text and Email Campaigns meant to pressure Lawmakers to support a Congressional Reversal of the Commission's Action. 'We'll be going to court soon to challenge the FCC and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,' said Craig Aaron, President of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had 'awakened the public.'From the FCC AnnouncementThe framework adopted by the Commission today will protect consumers at far less cost to investment than the prior rigid and wide-ranging utility rules. And restoring a favorable climate for network investment is key to closing the digital divide, spurring competition and innovation that benefits consumers. The Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order adopted by the Commission takes the following steps to achieve these goals:Declaratory Ruling-\uf0b7Restores the classification of broadband Internet access service as an 'information service' under Title I of the Communications Act\u2014the classification affirmed by the Supreme Court in the 2005 Brand X case.- Reinstates the classification of mobile broadband Internet access service as a private mobile service.- Finds that the regulatory uncertainty created by utility-style Title II regulation has reduced Internet service provider (ISP) investment in networks, as well as hampered innovation, particularly among small ISPs serving rural consumers.- Finds that public policy, in addition to legal analysis, supports the information service classification, because it is more likely to encourage broadband investment and innovation, thereby furthering the goal of closing the digital divide and benefitting the entire Internet ecosystem.- Restores broadband consumer protection authority to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), enabling it to apply its extensive expertise to provide uniform online protections against unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices.Report- Requires that ISPs disclose information about their practices to consumers, entrepreneurs, and the Commission, including any blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization.- Finds that transparency, combined with market forces as well as antitrust and consumer protection laws, achieve benefits comparable to those of the 2015 'bright line' rules at lower cost.- Eliminates the vague and expansive Internet Conduct Standard, under which the FCC could micromanage innovative business models.Order- Finds that the public interest is not served by adding to the already-voluminous record in this proceeding additional materials, including confidential materials submitted in other proceedings.NYC Wins When Everyone Can Vote!

The rules will let internet service providers block online content, or charge websites for faster delivery to consumers, by rolling back the protections against such actions that were adopted in 2015.</p><p>Several public interest groups, including Free Press and Public Knowledge, and some start-ups had announced plans to challenge the commission\u2019s move weeks ago, but the Internet Association had been undecided about how to respond. Before the commission voted on the repeal, some of America\u2019s biggest tech companies, Facebook and Google in particular, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-tech.html\">took a back seat</url> during public protests over the issue.</p><p>On Friday, a day after the commission released <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-restoring-internet-freedom-order\">the 539-page final rules</url>, the Internet Association said it would join the coming legal case against them.</p><p>\u201cThe rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d Michael Beckerman, the association\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday.</p><p>Netflix, whose data-heavy video streams could face extra charges by internet service providers, also said it would support a legal challenge.</p><p>\u201cIn 2018, the Internet is united in defense of <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash\">#NetNeutrality</url>. As for the FCC, we will see you in court,\u201d the company said in a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/949347324223832064\">message</url> posted on Twitter.</p><p>The issue of regulating internet service providers to maintain an open internet has wound through the courts and the commission for more than a decade. The repeal in December, led by Ajit Pai, the commission chairman, attracted strong opposition.</p><p>Mr. Pai has said the new rules would encourage more investment and innovation by internet service providers. He has also argued that the change would withstand any legal challenge, as it essentially restores the rules to what they were before 2015.</p><p>The commission declined to comment on Friday.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers in Washington hope to reverse the commission\u2019s action by using the Congressional Review Act, and they have introduced numerous bills that could replace the agency\u2019s rules, although the prospects for those efforts appear weak. States lawmakers in California, New York and Washington are also considering bills that would recreate the 2015 net- neutrality rules in those states.</p><p>Public interest groups are trying to make net neutrality an issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections. They have deployed text and email campaigns meant to pressure lawmakers to support a congressional reversal of the commission\u2019s action.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be going to court soon to challenge the F.C.C. and ramping up pressure on Congress to throw the rules out altogether,\u201d said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press. Mr. Pai, he said, had \u201cawakened the public.\u201d</p><p>The strong response to the repeal has also led to some safety concerns. At the commission meeting where the new rules were approved, law enforcement officials briefly cleared the room to address an unspecified security issue.</p><p>Mr. Pai canceled a scheduled appearance at the tech industry\u2019s CES trade show next week. The commission declined to say why he would not attend, but has previously confirmed that he and his family had recently received threats by phone and email over the net neutrality issue.</p><p>PHOTO: The repeal of net neutrality rules, led by Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, attracted strong public opposition.

Each CEO faced scrutiny over slightly different matters, but they generally projected the same idea: their successes are simply the result of their own ingenuity, and not due any monopolistic power-plays despite the mounting evidence. 'The retail market we participate in is extraordinarily large and competitive,' said Amazon's Jeff Bezos, according to the Wall Street Journal[2]. Bezos, by far the world's richest person, broke records[3] earlier this month when his fortune grew by $13 billion in a single day, thanks to surging Amazon stock. </p><p>Apple is the antitrust crew's best performing tech giantBut the divide between the US tech giants and smaller firms is severe since the enormous stock market crash that occurred in March. The graph below charts the past year'smarket performance of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet against the S&amp;#38;P Small Cap 600 Information Technology[4] index, as tracked by Invesco's corresponding ETF (PSCT). PSCT follows 74 companiesvaluedbetween $300 million and $1.4 billion, and serves as a benchmark for the smaller (but investable) fish in US tech. First, note how well Apple stock hasperformed, both pre- and post-COVID crash. $AAPLis up more than 80% since this time last year despite the market turmoil. This added nearly $694 billion to its market value, solidifying the iPhone maker's position as the most valuable US company,tech or otherwise. Overall, thedata showsUS tech small caps have recovered far slower than FAAA, which is up 46% since this time last year.<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2020/07/30/facebook-amazon-alphabet-apple-congress-chart-sp-smallcaps-monopoly-antritrust/#FAAA\">https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2020/07/30/facebook-amazon-alphabet-apple-congress-chart-sp-smallcaps-monopoly-antritrust/#FAAA</url> represents the equal-weighted price performance of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet.But check how US tech small caps performed in the first half of the chart. PSCT tracked pretty well alongside Facebook and Alphabet, and was evenway ahead of Amazon at the start of 2020\u2014 right up until February, when the COVID-19 threat began to coalesce in the West. The difference is most apparent when comparing FAAA's marketperformance against their small cap counterparts over the year-to-date. Amazon (59%), Apple (26%), Alphabet (10%), and Facebook (10%) are all well in the green in 2020, while PSCT is still looking heavy, down more than 6%. [Read:Anatomy of the FANTAMAN, the tech stock amalgam worth more than Germany's GDP[5]] As for what will alleviate FAAA's apparent control over the market, House Antitrust Committee Chairman David Cicilline maintained that tech giants present a modern problem that requires specialized regulation. 'Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age,' concluded Cicilline.

This is one of those times. Several US politicians, most loudly presidential wannabe Elizabeth Warren, are calling for the break-up of \"Big Tech\". If they have their way, British consumers and businesses will share with their American counterparts both the benefits, if any, and the costs, if any, of a radical restructuring of a large sector of the economy - one that has changed the way we communicate, get news, shop, do research and live our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The call for the break-up of Facebook, Google (for convenience, I use that designation rather than its parent Alphabet), Amazon and perhaps others goes far beyond what competition enforcers in the EU and in Britain have been doing - fines and forcing an end to certain practices, but leaving the structures of the companies untouched.</p><p>The challenge is serious, more so because it is part of a basic rethinking of competition law, dominated for decades by the so-called Chicago School led by my former colleague Bob Bork: in brief, no consumer harm, mostly in the form of higher prices, equals no antitrust problem. Companies giving away their services (Google, Facebook), or driving prices down (Amazon), could not possibly be violating the law. They are the consumers' friends.</p><p>Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who chairs the House antitrust sub-committee, is not so sure. He has issued a sweeping demand for Big Tech company documents, and will soon hold hearings. His counsel, Lina Khan, triggered the policy rethink when at Yale Law School. The attackers also include the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the attorneysgeneral of 48 states, plus Puerto Rico and DC (California, home to many of these companies, and Alabama have abstained), and assorted academics.</p><p>Their targets are relying on their mere size being no offence under existing competition law. So long as they can show their size results from superior efficiency and skill - from building the proverbial better mousetrap - it will be difficult for even the most skilled lawyers to persuade a judge to follow the lead of a court that, in 1984, ordered the dismemberment of communications giant AT&amp;T. Big Tech has two problems in relying on that defence. The first is that they grew largely by acquiring other companies. Amazon has bought or invested in at least 128 companies in the past 20 years, and its appetite seems undiminished. Facebook grew by snapping up 79 companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Google has more than 200 acquisitions under its belt, including YouTube, Nest Labs and DoubleClick. In this era of newly revived antitrust enforcement, many of these deals might have been turned down by regulators because they harmed competition, real or potential. The approval of those deals is now being reviewed by the authorities.</p><p>Big Tech's second problem is posed by some of its business practices, which may have contributed more to the companies' growth than the construction of better mousetraps. Amazon's use of own-brand merchandise to compete with vendors that use its distribution system is causing concern, and announcing a plan to enter the meal-kit market sent shares plummeting in rival Blue Apron.</p><p>\"Amazon Meal Kits\" are now displayed prominently in Whole Foods, acquired by Amazon for $13.7bn in cash in 2017.</p><p>Google, which has what regulators consider a dominant share of the search market, allegedly uses that power to promote its own maps and other products over those of small competitors. Facebook's promises of reform remain just that, and its lack of competition has prevented users from switching to other platforms in protest.

This is one of those times. Several US politicians, most loudly presidential wannabe Elizabeth Warren, are calling for the break-up of \"Big Tech\". If they have their way, British consumers and businesses will share with their American counterparts both the benefits, if any, and the costs, if any, of a radical restructuring of a large sector of the economy - one that has changed the way we communicate, get news, shop, do research and live our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The call for the break-up of Facebook, Google (for convenience, I use that designation rather than its parent Alphabet), Amazon and perhaps others goes far beyond what competition enforcers in the EU and in Britain have been doing - fines and forcing an end to certain practices, but leaving the structures of the companies untouched.</p><p>The challenge is serious, more so because it is part of a basic rethinking of competition law, dominated for decades by the so-called Chicago School led by my former colleague Bob Bork: in brief, no consumer harm, mostly in the form of higher prices, equals no antitrust problem. Companies giving away their services (Google, Facebook), or driving prices down (Amazon), could not possibly be violating the law. They are the consumers' friends.</p><p>Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who chairs the House antitrust sub-committee, is not so sure. He has issued a sweeping demand for Big Tech company documents, and will soon hold hearings. His counsel, Lina Khan, triggered the policy rethink when at Yale Law School. The attackers also include the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the attorneysgeneral of 48 states, plus Puerto Rico and DC (California, home to many of these companies, and Alabama have abstained), and assorted academics.</p><p>Their targets are relying on their mere size being no offence under existing competition law. So long as they can show their size results from superior efficiency and skill - from building the proverbial better mousetrap - it will be difficult for even the most skilled lawyers to persuade a judge to follow the lead of a court that, in 1984, ordered the dismemberment of communications giant AT&amp;T. Big Tech has two problems in relying on that defence. The first is that they grew largely by acquiring other companies. Amazon has bought or invested in at least 128 companies in the past 20 years, and its appetite seems undiminished. Facebook grew by snapping up 79 companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Google has more than 200 acquisitions under its belt, including YouTube, Nest Labs and DoubleClick. In this era of newly revived antitrust enforcement, many of these deals might have been turned down by regulators because they harmed competition, real or potential. The approval of those deals is now being reviewed by the authorities.</p><p>Big Tech's second problem is posed by some of its business practices, which may have contributed more to the companies' growth than the construction of better mousetraps. Amazon's use of own-brand merchandise to compete with vendors that use its distribution system is causing concern, and announcing a plan to enter the meal-kit market sent shares plummeting in rival Blue Apron.</p><p>\"Amazon Meal Kits\" are now displayed prominently in Whole Foods, acquired by Amazon for $13.7bn in cash in 2017.</p><p>Google, which has what regulators consider a dominant share of the search market, allegedly uses that power to promote its own maps and other products over those of small competitors. Facebook's promises of reform remain just that, and its lack of competition has prevented users from switching to other platforms in protest. Or so its critics claim.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a move that is either courageous or reckless, Google has presented itself as a test case of the new, reinvigorated competition policy by buying Fitbit for $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn), pending regulatory approval. The price is no problem - it comes to less than 2% of the company's net cash balance - and Google also accounts for 37.2% of all digital advertising spending, according to the research firm eMarketer.</p><p>Google says it will not use the health data available from Fitbit's 28m active users to target its ads better and so increase its market share. Regulators will want more than mere promises.</p><p>This is not the place to consider whether competition from other advertising outlets or emerging competitors (among them Amazon) is sufficiently intense to make digital dominance by Google and Facebook irrelevant. Lots of lawyers and economic consultants, not to mention lobbyists for both companies, will be comfortably retired before that issue is decided.</p><p>Which brings us back to the EU approach - order an end to anticompetitive practices, levy fines, but do not break up these companies. An alternative remedy is forced restructuring - break-up in some form.</p><p>Amazon might be required to make its infrastructure widely available and to cease selling own-brand products in competition with small companies that sell via Amazon.

So, should giant tech companies be broken up now to protect the common good?  I'm joined by Google's former CE, Eric Schmidt, and one of its current directors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTRESS, \"KING LEAR\":  Expose yourself to fear.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Power and politics in the court of \"King Lear\".  Legendary actress, Glenda Jackson, has been taking Broadway by storm, gender bending Shakespeare's tragic hero at 83.</p><p>Then, the new kid on the block, 19-year-old director, Phillip Youmans, makes history at the Tribeca Film Festival and sits down with our Alicia Menendez to tell his amazing story.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>So, has big tech finally just gotten too big and too powerful?  As Silicon Valley dives ever deeper and deeper into our lives, there are rising calls for oversight.  When it comes to regulation, though, Europe is leading the United States.  And the summit in Paris this week with tech and world leaders is trying to get to grips with the idea of all-powerful monopolies, invasion of privacy and democracy, the spread of extremism and violence.</p><p>The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is coming to co-chair the meeting and rally support for the Christchurch call, that's a pledge names for the massacres there when a White nationalist mowed down 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques and live streamed it on Facebook.  And tomorrow, I'll sit down with the prime minister in Paris to hear about her hopes to eliminate extremism online.</p><p>Ardern's host and co-chair will, of course, be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and he has just met with Mark Zuckerberg, as the Facebook founder continues his worldwide efforts at damage control while rejecting one of his own co-founders calls for Facebook to finally be broken up.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, tech leaders claim they are best placed to self-regulate, and they reject government intervention.  I asked the former CEO and chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and Alan Eagle, who is company director, what it would take to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to online content.  They join me to discuss their new book, \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" about Bill Campbell, the football coach who became a guru in Silicon Valley because of his teachings on ethical leadership.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, welcome to the program.</p><p>Look, we are talking in a really heightened state of attention on the social giants, the big tech giants.  You know that President Macron of France is talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, also to the prime minister of New Zealand in the wake of this horror in Christchurch, which was, to an extent, aided and abetted and supported by violent extremist content online.</p><p>So, what do you think about the state of your big companies right now?  Is there room?  Is it time to make some dramatic changes in solutions?  First, since you were CEO.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER GOOGLE CEO AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  Well, I always worry about regulation, which is around the current problem and not fixing the real problem.  I think it's much better when the tech giants, as you call them, work on solving this themselves.  Each company is different.</p><p>In Google's case we worked really, really hard to find and detect evil things that violate our policies and take them down super quickly.  There's furthermore promise that A.I. will allow this to be detected automatically.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What about you?  I mean, they -- you are giants.  I mean, you've dominated the landscape ever since sort of, you know, this started.  What do you think?  Because everybody says, yes, you know, these companies should regulate themselves.  We don't want government, et cetera.  But the U.S. is playing catch up to Europe where there is regulation and to a growing clamor amongst people for some kind of more responsible attitude toward what's out there.</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  I can just tell you from what's going on day-to-day inside the company as a director on the sales team, people are working very hard every day to do the right thing.</p><p>As Eric was talking about, you know, in an open web, it's going to be a constant battle of people putting up bad things and we try to find them and bring them down as quickly as possible.  But the company really is trying very hard working very hard on these every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, I'm going to play a soundbite from Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential candidates.  And she along with Senator Elizabeth Warren are very clear about what they say they want to do, and that is sort of a breakup of the giant companies.  This is what she said recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have to recognize it for what it is, it is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.  And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, she is talking sense, right?  It's gone unregulated, and to a great degree, I mean, Google, Facebook, all the others, have not done enough, according to her and according to many people, to regulate themselves.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  She's also running for president.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  As is her competitor, Elizabeth Warren.  There's no basis in law to break up these companies in the U.S.  And fundamentally, the breakup would increase costs.  It's far, far better for the companies to try to figure out how to solve this problem.</p><p>The people inside these companies don't want this stuff to happen either.  The fact of the matter is that a very small percentage of humans do really bad things.  We need to get better at detecting these things and stopping it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What would you then say when you say there's no basis in law or we the companies should do it ourselves and not have government -- what then is a solution?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, as I said, the computer industry as a whole, and each of the companies, YouTube does a fantastic job of this, detect bad stuff automatically using various mathematical techniques in history and so forth.  And the things that are put up are taken down in a very few number of seconds.  That's probably the state of the art right now and it's getting better and better.</p><p>I don't know how, in a world where humans can upload over and over again things which are evil, how you can prevent that without having a censorship regime.  Do you really want to put in government censors on what people say?  I don't think so.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You describe it as censorship.  This is what Chris Hughes, I realize he's not a Google employee or founder, but he was one of the founders of Facebook and he's been getting a huge amount of attention because he's said it's time for Mark Zuckerberg's power to be reduced by breaking up Facebook.  And particularly, he's talked about readdressing the acquisitions that Facebook made of WhatsApp and Instagram.  This is what he just recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  We shouldn't need to just trust the private sector to do the right thing.  I mean, we don't do that with airlines, we don't do that with pharmaceutical companies, we don't do that with the financial industry, we don't do that with health care.  We say we want competition.  We understand that dynamic markets are a good thing, but we want to also ensure that there's a baseline level of protection.</p><p>And the fact we haven't gotten there with digital companies, I think is a testament to how quickly not just Facebook but Google, Amazon, Apple, all of them have grown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The big four giants.  And again, you know, you said there's no basis in law, but there is in -- there's precedent in the United States for breaking up some of these big companies.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Not on --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Antitrust.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Not under the current set of laws in the U.S.  If you follow Chris' arguments, he's fundamentally arguing for very slow rates of innovation.  He benefited from the fact that Facebook's entry into an open web allowed the creation of an enormous achievement, which was Facebook at the time.  He benefited personally from that.</p><p>Do you really want to slow that down by a factor of 10?  Look at the rate of innovation in health care and aviation and industries that he named.  I would prefer to have the innovation run forward and then when things happen, let's get together and figure out a way to solve them.  Let's figure out how to not prematurely regulate these industries.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I hear you keep saying that and realize you're saying that from your, you know, innovator, business perspective.  I understand that.  It's also a massively profit-making business, there's no doubt about it.  And Chris Hughes, to be fair, does not attack Mark Zuckerberg personally.  He says he even thinks that Mark Zuckerberg thinks that he's got too much power and that's just too much power in any democracy.</p><p>Your book, the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"  I mean, you lion eyes this wonderful man, Bill Campbell, who has been so front and center of the Silicon Valley, of the innovation, and also of the ethic.  I mean, the book really does focus on his ethic in business.</p><p>How does that fit in to where we are now?  I mean, even if you don't like the idea of regulation, because after all, Americans, you know, are unregulatable and we don't like censorship, and entrepreneurship is, you know, has to happen come what may.  But surely there is today a common good that does need the kind of ethics that your book focuses on to be involved.</p><p>EAGLE:  Well, Bill was a football coach, American football, before he became -- went into business.  For him it was all about the team and the good of the team.  And so, when he would be looking, we can't assume what he would say today if he were dealing with some of these issues, but what he could look at is, what is the team?  Who are the right people working on it, and are they the right people?  Are they coachable?  Are they people who learn as they go and are they focused on integrity and doing the right thing?</p><p>So, it isn't so much -- he wouldn't talk to us about what should you do, but he'd look at, what is the right team?  Is the right team looking at it and do they have the right ethics along with the other traits that (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I just wonder what you as people and as tech innovators vested in this company particularly think when you see a Christchurch where it was live streamed and only apparently 4,000 people saw it live but then it was replicated so many times.  All of Putin, et cetera, interfering in our laws or the violence against women and other stuff we see.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It's always a shock to discover that there's evil in the world.  But the evil was there before Google, Facebook --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it was never so exponentially distributed.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It was certainly present and that evil now use the latest tools.  That doesn't mean that the tools themselves are evil.  It means that the toolmakers have to figure out ways to make sure this stuff is not misused.</p><p>In the cases you're citing, it's probably possible to detect this kind of behavior algorithmically that is very quickly.  So, when something bad comes up, basically, not only stop it but prevent it from being replicated.  YouTube does this quite well.</p><p>YouTube had this problem over a decade.  And what would happen is, people who were insane or evil or what have you would keep uploading bad stuff, especially if it was pornographic.  And we developed ways to not only to detect it but also prevent it.</p><p>The solution to this is to make sure that the common space follows the guidelines of (INAUDIBLE).  None of the companies you named have guidelines which allow the kind of evil you're describing.  It's their job, our job, to police that.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.  I mean, obviously, none of you would allow that kind of stuff.  I mean, It's so awful.  But just as you said that the internet had to start policing pornography and terrorism as well.  I mean, when there's an ISIS thing, people try to take it down or you all try to take it down as quickly as possible.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, we're clear, all of this content is not okay with any of these companies.  There's no company saying, \"Hey, we want more of this.\"  They all want less of it.  Give us the time to build the systems that detect it but don't otherwise harm innovation and free speech.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, I guess it just always comes back to, particularly in the world that we're living in right now.  First of all, it's not just antitrust, it's the wholesale violation of privacy and in some cases, massive technological, you know, surveillance state that in some countries is being enabled by all of this.  But it just does go on.  I mean, it does, and it is hard for people now to accept that it's a big moneymaker for you all at their cost.  Given the fact that it's also massively helpful in so many parts of the endeavor.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, would you prefer these services all charge their actual rates and rather than be free?  Would you prefer that they have registered users, as you have in China, where all of a sudden, the government knows exactly what their use is?  There are real trade-offs here.</p><p>And while we focus on these exceptions, which are bad exceptions, let's not forget the good, right?  These are platforms which are broadly available.  There are multibillions of people using them.  They've brought enormous benefits of knowledge.  If you look at the developing world it has an access to information, access to health care.  The empowerment of new competitors and the empowerment of interview entrants.  Over and over and over again, the number of companies that have been abled by these technologies is extraordinary.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt about that.  However, there is absolutely -- the good news, would you prefer this or that?  Well, I belong to a profession that is regulated, you know.  And I'm a member of the press with the First Amendment right behind me constitutionally.  But nonetheless, there are things we cannot say or do in our profession.</p><p>So, let's get back to the \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" because he is really an interesting man.  And when he talks about leadership, which I actually think is fascinating, particularly in this world, what makes a great leader?  What -- is it about just winning?  Is it about subjugation and dominance?  And he -- you quote him or you write about him.  He says, \"You need to,\" according to a 1994 study, \"go beyond the traditional notion of managing that focuses on controlling, supervising, evaluating and rewarding/punishing to create a climate of communication, respect, feedback and trust.  All through coaching.\"</p><p>Tell me how that plays out then in your experience?  What did he teach you all, and how does that come into play in these positions of really huge leadership and power that you have?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, as you talked about it, these are incredibly stressful and important decisions.  And the question is, not what the decision should be.  Bill would teach who is taking the decision and how do you get the right people.</p><p>And he would often say the problem is you have the people who think they know the answer.  Let's go find the smartest people, get them and work on it really quickly.  Over and over again at Google, we found small groups of people who are incredibly expert, who had an idea to solve the problems that you named or others, and we relied on them.  The right thing happened.</p><p>What the coach told us was it's a coaching mechanism and it's a team sport, right?  Everyone is focused on the leader by name.  Everyone knows the famous leaders of these companies and the famous founders, but you forget there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are working with them to collectively make this happen.</p><p>This book is about coaching the whole team.  I would argue, by the way, that this is a new Silicon Valley export.  The notion of business coaching of the whole team.  And the reason is, think about it, in any sport, are there any teams that succeed without coaches?  Of course not.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, again, I find the idea of the pyramid, which we all live in a pyramid.  We hear at now Warner Media.  We have a boss and it filters down.  How do you get team members from -- you know, from the lowest up to the highest, to feel that they can safely and securely, as long as they're competent and good and do their job well and all the rest of it, either back up what you're doing or complain or even whistleblower to you, I'm not saying public, but come and talk to you about things that make them uneasy?  Because, you know, there's some issues with Google.  I mean, the 20,000 people walk out over the allegations of sexual harassment, 50 cities in November.</p><p>EAGLE:  I think that was Google culture working at its best.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EAGLE:  Because the answer to your question is to listen to people.  And you said the word safely, that's what you want.  Create a safe place for people to speak up.  Eric talked about decision making.  When you are making a decision, you may know what the decision already is, you may know what the right thing to do is, but make sure everybody gets heard.  People will fall in line with the decision much better, even if it doesn't go their way if they have been actually listened to.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And you talked about censorship a moment ago, would you prefer to have censorship?  Well, in many places there is censorship like in China and, obviously, Google has come across and come to sort of its accommodation with China.</p><p>You said last year at a private event, Eric, that you predicted we'd see a \"bifurcation\" into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.  And you warned of the danger of leadership in that way from a Chinese government that values censorship.  But at the same time, and we've reported this a lot, Google was under heat for its own employees for Project Dragonfly, which is kind of a censored version of a search engine that would, you know, keep certain information away from the Chinese authorities.  Where do you come down on that?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, let's talk about China and the internet for a second.  The Chinese internet companies are faster growing and higher valuation than what you call big tech here in the West.  They are operating and growing in a separate ecosystem.  They have some links outside of China.  But China itself is so large, as a business, and they are so successful that they are primarily domestically focused.</p><p>If you talk to the founders of those companies, their primary concern is the government because the government could, for example, arbitrarily decide to not allow them to do a product or so forth and so on.  All of them are subject to the very aggressive laws with respect to surveillance, loss of privacy and so forth.</p><p>My concern is that that model not become the internet and my concern is that the internet not split in that way.  I think it's very important that Western values of openness and communications and so forth, which we took for granted, are globally available.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- I mean, taking what you've just said, are you pleased then that the complaints by Google employees about this, which were verbalized, have apparently put operation Dragonfly either on hold or have ditched it altogether?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, again, not involved with those decisions.  So, I don't know the specifics of the decision.  What I can tell you is our culture encourages this kind of expression of interest.  The company has to make the decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- go ahead.</p><p>EAGLE:  I'm pleased that employees felt it was okay to speak up.  Whether or not they influenced something or not, they felt empowered, they didn't -- they felt something that wasn't going right at the company or at least in their opinion it wasn't, and they felt they could speak up about it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And in fact, the current CEO, Sundar Pichai, says it was merely an internal project.  He's denied any plans to launch one in China and says the project has since been dropped.  Bill Campbell, would he have agreed with that?  Are you pleased that it's been dropped, whatever was going on?</p><p>EAGLE:  Again, I'm pleased people felt empowered to talk up about it, speak up about it and that they were listened to, regardless of the issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What is the biggest takeaway in terms of management between leaders and employees that we -- that you hope you take from this book?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  The basic principle is bring humanity back into the workplace.  Respect, listening, caring about people, helping them achieve their objectives.  This is what Bill was all about.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that could be an exponential game changer because still, to this day, the little people are still nervous about their jobs should they feel that they're part of the project and feel empowered and then get themselves slapped around.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, and the book is called \"Trillion Dollar Coach\" because Bill was both Steve Jobs' coach --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  -- as well as my coach, and the sum of that is more than a trillion dollars of shareholder value.  He's by far the most successful coach in the world.  And at Google, and I suspect at Apple, you would never be able refer to our employees as little people, right?  Our model --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm talking about on the totem pole.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I'm -- our model is huge empowerment to our individual employees, which I'm very proud of.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What did you get from him, from Bill?  I know he was your coach.  And also, wasn't Steve Jobs a little bit sort of nervous about Bill coaching all the competitors as well?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, what's interesting about Bill is he managed to actually coach not just Apple and Google but many other companies in the Valley.  And he managed to do this because he was not involved in the product decisions.  He let the product decisions, which often were very complicated and different, stay separate.  He coached them, people, as individuals.</p><p>And somehow in the middle of all of the conflict between Apple and Google, he managed to do it and did it fairly to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>EAGLE:  And he built incredible trust, again, by listening, by being loyal, by being, you know, very careful with keeping secrets and he just built tremendous trust.  So, he could work with many different players.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Excellent.  Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  OK.  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The book is the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Thank you.</p><p>EAGLE:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now, we're going to take a cue from Shakespeare and his eternally timely, \"King Lear.\"  It too is all about power, a team of rivals and a big breakup of his kingdom no less.</p><p>Lear's decent into madness makes him one of the most challenging characters to grapple with on stage.  The latest actor taking up the gauntlet is Glenda Jackson.  At 83 years old, she's showing no signs of slowing down as she throws herself into eight shows a week on Broadway.</p><p>Fierce, funny and frank, it's a delight to welcome her back to this program between, of course, shows.  There you are in New York.</p><p>Welcome back, Glenda Jackson.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is exhaust, right?  I mean, it's very physical and all-encompassing performance.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, it is and it isn't.  I mean, I'm used to eight shows a week.  I mean, that was the work toll, that it was practiced in England when I began and still is.  But there is enormous energy in the play itself.  And if you can touch into that energy, and we do as a company, then, really, I mean, I sometimes feel more energized when it's -- when we've done it than when I started.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I wonder whether -- because you've also said that you think, you know, Shakespeare is perhaps one of the most, if not the most contemporary of playwrights.  And given all --</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, he is.  Undoubtedly.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  And we've just been talking about leadership --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- and power and corruption and breakup and ethics.  Where does he fit in for you?  Why do you call him still so contemporary?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, because he essentially only ever writes about us, about human beings.  And human nature is immutable.  Yes, we can and we do when we're still trying to improve the human condition.  But we, as human beings, don't change that much.  And there are tropes in the play that are absolutely reflected in the world as we know it today.</p><p>When I was particularly interested hearing the previous piece about power and leadership because Lear says in the play that he was flattered like a dog as the king.  People said to him aye and no to everything he said.  And the line is, \"Aye and no, too, is no good divinity.\"  And so, that is something that is still prevalent now.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, continuing that theme, this particular production of \"King Lear\" takes place, essentially in a single kind of gilded room.  And --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- you know, it then turns into a bit of a ruin in the second part.  But nonetheless, as you can imagine, given the times we're living in, some of the theater critics have said, \"Well, that room, that sort of -- that room must be Trumpian.  It must be the Trump tower conference room.\"  I mean, do you ever think about that?  Is there any kind of truth to that at all?</p><p>JACKSON:  I think there may have been something there in the background but certainly, Lear is not that kind of person.  I mean, the point about Lear is that he's a man who no one has ever said no to in his entire life.  He was born to that position of power.  He's, obviously, conducted it well.  He says he's handing it over to younger strength than his because he wants to have a peaceful retirement, ideally with his youngest, most favorite daughter in probably the most favorite place in this kingdom.  And it doesn't happen like that.</p><p>And so, what he has known all his life begins in the most terrible way to fracture, to fall apart, to finish.  But his power is never something that he's had to question or has been questioned until this critical moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, we're going to be playing now a little clip because it has been filmed.  And we've been talking about ethics.  And he's now losing his faculties, but he's got one sort of clear moment and here it is.  Here's you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are.  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm.  How shall your houseless heads, your own [phonetic], your looped and windowed raggedness, defend me from seasons such as this.  Aaah!  I have ta-en to little care of this.  Take physic pomp.  Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, that last line essentially says it all, \"Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.\"  Talk to me a little bit about that.</p><p>JACKSON:  It resonates particularly with me because when I was first elected a Member of Parliament, I think virtually every shop doorway in London and possibly in every metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, was the bedroom, living room and bathroom of some homeless person.  There had been major, major changes made in our social housing structures by the Then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed tenants to buy their properties usually at way below market prices.</p><p>And there was no recompense in replacing those -- that social housing foundation with new social housing.  And although the number of people who were homeless in my country went down, we are now seeing those numbers going up.  And certainly, here in New York, we see people on the streets every night.</p><p>And it is that, for him, for -- certainly for Lear, he makes that connection.  And I'm truly certain it is the first time in his life.  I'm pretty certain he thought all the time before then, but no word, if these people don't have anywhere to live it's because they're too idle to work.  You would find that opinion being replicated even now.</p><p>It suddenly strikes home to him because he suddenly, in the strange kind of way, realizes that he has no home.  He has nowhere to live.  And it's that acknowledgment that when he had the power to do something, essentially, you prevent that situation, he ducked out of it.  He wasn't aware of it, actually.  I think that is a moment of genuine shame for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really interesting because it's sort of builds on that theme, your -- King Lear's good friend, the Earl of Gloucester, who is also brought down by a disloyal child, he also finds himself, at one point, being confronted by a poor mentally ill man in the streets, and he gives him some money in the account (ph) and he says, \"So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.\"  I mean, you know, contemporarily, that would be redistribution of wealth.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely, it would, yes.  And look how hard that is, and becoming harder, it would seem.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it is incredible that those themes, I mean, as you say, they are so contemporary and so eternal.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Look, we make a big deal, I don't know why, about saying you're 83 years old and you're still doing this.  However, I think one of the reasons is the admiration that you still have so much gusto and so much, you know, spark on stage and get such great reviews and pulling in such audiences.  But also, I wonder whether Lear has to be played in your later years, in a later year.</p><p>And I just want you to think about that while I play something -- I hate to name drop, but I did interview Sir Ian McKellen and he played it on stage in London and talked about this connection between age and Lear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN MCKELLEN, ACTOR:  Well, there was a great actor in my youth, Ralph Richardson, a film star and stage star, who said in his typical wry, witty way, you get out of bed, it's a beautiful day.  The birds are tweeting, the sun is in the sky.  Your wife is being nice to you.  Nothing could go wrong.  And then, oh, you finally got your foot caught in a Lear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's kind of sweet they way he says it, but just this sort of inevitability, if you have the talent to play this in your -- in your -- in your later years, did you feel caught in a lear?</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTOR:  No, because the I don't -- Lear doesn't regard himself as being old.  I mean, he only acknowledges his age right at the end of the play and the part itself, actually, it demands energy.  I mean, it's not an old man's part in what was the kind of, oh I don't know, I mean, we're so hypocritical aren't we, as people, about age?</p><p>I mean, I remember when state pension age in my country was 65 and you expected suddenly, the day after you were 65 to have lost all the powers of understanding, not be able to walk, I mean, it's just ridiculous you know.</p><p>I mean, my birthday was last week.  I think I'm exactly the same the day after my birthday than I was before, but this thing about age is something -- I mean, you allow it to work into energy.</p><p>I -- one of the things I treasure most in my life is that by the accident of my birth, I was born in what we used to call the working classes, we're now called blue collar, I -- it was very simple for that class.  If you didn't work, you didn't eat.  And so, I have a very, very strong work ethic and I bless -- I bless my family for giving me that inheritance because it's been of immense value to me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And it's great actually, I just want to also -- there is so much ageism in society and sexism in society and here you are a woman of a certain age, and by the way happy birthday, not just playing this part, but also playing it as a woman.</p><p>And I think you were the -- well, one of the first women.  I think Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in, obviously, in the last century, but nonetheless, what you do make of that?  Did you ever get any misogynistic backlash?</p><p>JACKSON:  None whatever.  I mean, it is very, very rare.  I can't think anyone who's actually seen the play with me in it has raised that issue at all.  I mean, it may be -- we did have a gender bender battle in England and that has been triumphantly won by the group of actresses who created a company and kicked off that battle playing all the Shakespearean histories, all women casts, I think that battle, in the sense, has been won.</p><p>One of the touching things that was said to me -- no one has really, because I don't play it as a woman in that sense.  I mean one of the benefits of my being a member of</p><p>Parliament was that I visited old people's homes, day centers, places that helped people with disabilities and things of that nature, and we are, as a race, a breed, whatever you like to call us, living longer and longer and one of the fascinating things that I saw was that as we do get older, there's absolute boundaries that define our gender begin to crack, they begin to fray.</p><p>I mean we are taught, are we not, to be boys or girls.  Babies, when they're born, they don't know what their gender is and as we get older they begin to be filtrated by something else and that's very useful.</p><p>But one of the audience members who waited outside the theater one night said to me, I've seen this play many, many times and it's the first time I've seen an aspect of Lear that could have a maternal quality.  I don't play that maternal quality, but it is, undoubtedly, in there.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  That's is such -- that is really impressive.</p><p>JACKSON:  . brilliant Mr. Shakespeare, isn't it?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is.</p><p>JACKSON:  . just fascinating.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes, that really is.  And we had the opportunity to talk to Kate Pakenham who was head of the Donmar Warehouse, who did that trilogy, of course, as you said, there's Julius Caesar and two others, all women casts and it was amazing.  But she did say, because perhaps she was the first there was quite a lot of backlash here in Britain.</p><p>And we've also explore a lot on this show about work and sort of useful contribution to society, even beyond the retiring age.  So, I think you're absolutely right, these issues are happening.</p><p>But I want to play another clip from something you did much, much earlier.  Essentially it's -- it's -- I mean, it's got a long, long title, but it's the -- the -- the movie \"Marat/Sade\" and we're going to take a clip of your performance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Why are they housing (ph)?  What are they dragging through the streets?  They carry stakes, but what's impaled on those stakes?  What do they have?  What are they dancing for?  Why are they wrapped with laughter?  Why do the children scream?  What are those heaps they fight over?  Those heaps with eyes and mouths?  What kind of town is this?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You do -- you do mad very well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, I'll say thank you, even though I have my doubts, but thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, but it is interesting that -- I mean there's that much earlier in your career, there's this we show, two clips where you're really showing the frailties, the decent into madness, mental illness.  I mean, how do you -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, what I was going to say is, both of those examples where set in times.  I mean, certainly, the \"Marat/Sade\" was set in a specific time.  Shakespeare wrote his play in a specific time where the use of medicine was not there as a calming influence on people were having serious mental health problems and I think that is reflection.  So it's -- I mean, I think one of the areas which is very different today is that increase of medicinal calming.  I mean, I use that word, I mean it's the wrong word, but you know what I mean.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I do.  I do know what you mean, and very briefly, we've only got about a minute left.  You said that, in a recent radio interview, you said you think the inside me is about 15-years-old.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.  That's true, I do.  It's the envelop which carries our inside us that is increasingly disobedient.  Fingers don't do what you tell them to do, knees don't bend when you want them to do and the other amazing thing about reaching the age that I have is I -- I'm suddenly blinding aware of how little I know and how much there is that I would like to know.  So, I have a bit more time and can perhaps can close up those areas of total ignorance.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And what would be your next dream role, what happens after \"Lear\" for you?</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, look, I mean I remember all those years when there was no work available and one was just desperate for it.  So, anything that comes through the front door that is something is welcome.  I've always felt, when a job finishes, that I'm never going to be employed again.  Let's hope that I can be wrong.  That's that one of the things that I hope I learn.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm sure you are wrong.  Glenda Jackson, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now we turn to a new kid on the block, a teenage filmmaker just starting out, but already making waves.  He's 19-year-old Phillip Youmans.  His first feature, \"Burning Cane\" snapped up three awards at this year's Tribecca Film Festival.  The film is set in rural Louisiana and it tells a story of a deeply religious woman and her struggle to reconcile her faith with the love that she holds for her alcoholic son and a troubled preacher.</p><p>Phillip Youmans has now made history as the youngest director to feature in the festival and the first African-American to win the top prize.  And our Alicia Menendez spoke to him about the story behind his amazing story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Phillip, thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on your recent honor.</p><p>PHILLIP YOUMAN, FILMMAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Tell me what this film \"Burning Cane\" is about?</p><p>YOUMAN:  So, \"Burning Cane\" is about Helen Wayne (ph) a mother living in rural Louisiana.  Her son, Daniel and his son Jeremiah and also her pastor, Reverend Tillman (ph) and their relationships with each other, their relationships with their religion and their community and how their environment and their home effects really every aspect in the fabric of their lives.  It's about how religion, it sort of governs their community.  It's about the cyclical nature of destructive behavior and how vices are passed down in lineage very often.</p><p>And it's also about the dangers of enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion and then taking religious doctrine (ph) literally.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What is the meaning behind the title of the film, \"Burning Cane?\"</p><p>YOUMAN:  Burning cane is a part of harvesting cane, but -- and it's a part of the culture and the fabric of the entire process in the community.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Sugar cane?</p><p>YOUMAN:  Sugar cane.  But, it also releases toxins that are very negative for people's health.  And so, I think there's just an interesting sort of a dichotomy there, in that it is such an important part of their economy about -- it's -- and sugar cane in that -- in that -- in that industry is an important part of the culture and the fabric of that area, but it is also detrimental to their health in terms of the toxins that are released in the air because of it.</p><p>So, and I feel like that sort of touches on the sort -- the multi-dimensionality of all the characters that kind of populate the film.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You finished this film up during your senior year of high school, 17-years-old.  Tell me about the process of making this film.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  So it started when I was 16.  In the December of my junior year of high school I wrote this short script called \"The Glory\", and then I wanted to make that short, but I stepped away to make another short.  And then after that, my instructor at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts named Isaac Webb told me that he thought that the film had feature length potential because of the fact that it was so grounded in character, that it seemed like it could be something that could be made feasibly.  And so, I just because like obsessed with that idea.  And then in the ensuing weeks and months I was just churning out drafts of the feature length script, going through script revisions, meeting actors all the while raising money and casting.</p><p>And then so in that summer before my senior year, we went into production and shot the bulk of principal photography and then shot Wendell's piece in that August, and then the rest of senior year was spent in post production.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  For someone who doesn't go to an elite school like the one that you went to, how do you make a film like this?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think at my age when we made this film, I relied so much on the fact that the artists that were my friends and a lot of my friends who weren't artists were just really behind my mission and my drive.  And when you can't pay people industry rate, especially when we were that young, you have to rely on people wanting to work for you regardless or wanting to work with you because they believe in your and they believe in the project.  And for me in that case, those are my friends.  So I've actually been telling people recently that I feel like if you're as young as I was making a film, I think you really do have to kind of rely on your friends and your community in a way to ban together and help you figure out some of those resource and some of those jobs.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said, \"I think now is probably the best time for \"Burning Cane\" to come out.  Why now?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, there is - there is - there is two parts to that.  I think that just - I think it's time for us to kind of take an objective look just at religion and its role in our community and how it plays into our advancement as a community.  And I also think in terms of making this, you know, in more like applicable sense I had to make the film then and now because of the fact that there was such a community around me that there was no other time that I was going to be able to rely on people's good will quite like I could then because the moment you turn 18, then you're an adult and people expect and entirely different thing, you know?</p><p>So when I was 18, we were already in post production, but when I was 17 I think we kind of - we were aware of the fact that people thought that we were just a student production and in that they were willing to give so much because they thought they were just helping out some kids.  And we were, you know, young, but we always envisioned this going farther than just, you know, a student project.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  There's a clip I want to watch.  It comes very early in the film, and it is Wendell Pierce giving his first sermon that we see in the film.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WENDELL PIERCE:  Now however it says he has died, he has learned that is not to be true.  That's not true.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don't mean nothing if you're going to lose your soul.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  He knows that's not to be true because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn't get him across Jordan into heaven.  No toys gets you into heaven.  It's the friendships that you have.  It's the kindness that you do.  Did you clothe me when I was naked?  Did you give me housing when I had no place to live?  Did you feed me when I was hungry?  Did you drink - give me water to drink when I was thirsty?  He who dies with the most toys wins.  What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Talk to me about the dichotomy of cutting between this sermon and then this man reckoning with his won demons?</p><p>YOUMANS:  There's some truth to what Tillman says in that sermon in that he believes that friendships and personal relationships are more valuable than material possessions, and I think most of us can kind of agree with that.  And I just kind of wanted to show the fact that there can be some truth that comes from this man and he can also still be broken.  He can still be a beacon for people that may oral status (ph) that pastors have but still be grappling with all those same demons on his own.  And it just brings about the question of whether or not we should be following anybody who can't really practice what they preach, but we should - should we even expect anyone to be able to do that?  That's a whole other question, you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did you convince Wendell Pierce to be apart of this film?</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, I - so in the - in the - on the months leading up to preproduction - well, in the months leading up to production actually, I was working at Morning Call Coffee Stand in City Park and I was waiting on a woman named Lula Elzy who's also an alumni of the same high school that Wendell and I went to - the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.  And I went up to Ms. Elzy and I was waiting on her table.  And she asked me about what I wanted to do, what school I went to.  And then I was talking to her about some of the roles in the project.  I told her that we had casted pretty much every role except this preacher, and I was just kind of explaining, you know, the preacher's motivations, where he was in this life.</p><p>And she said, \"what do you think of Wendell Pierce playing the role?\"  And of course I like freaked out, you know, because is Wendell is so - is big in our community not only because he's a brilliant actor, but because of - because of the work that he's done in Pontchartrain Park where he grew up, you know, and sort of helping stop all the gentrification that was coming through that area.  And then she texted him right in that moment and he responded to her quickly.  I think she said like, \"there's a (noka) student who's shooting a feature film this summer.</p><p>He's interested in seeing you play this role.\"  And he was like, \"OK, give him my email.\"  And so, I got his email and after that it was really just a back and forth with the script trying to make dates work, you know, looping him into all script revisions and - but Wendell coming in, it helped expand the community because initially the film was so much more centered on Daniel and Helen's relationship as a mother and son.  What Wendell came in and allowed is to kind of build this entire portrait as a community and show - and show how Helen's religion and the people that she associates with her religion, how they directly affect her actions with her loved ones and her family.  So it's just - it allowed the entire story, the entire community of Laurel Valley to be flushed out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did working with Wendell change you as a director?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think before working with Wendell or even before \"Burning Cane\" I had - I had kind of a messed up idea about what directing was.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What did you think it was?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I thought it was so much more, you know, commanding, so much more - so much more authoritarian than it really is and than it really should be.  It's so much more about the conversations that you have and sometimes maybe even the conversations that you have before you even show up to set, you know?  And I think what working with Wendell and Kaia and Dominique kind of taught me is that they're brilliant actors and you have to give brilliant actors the space to create alongside you.  It was just a - it was just a back and forth, you know, dialogue, and I mean, he made all the great choices, so it's - yes, it worked out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  He's not the only character in the film that struggles with addiction.  Let's take a look at another clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The main character, this is her son dancing around with his son, passes the little boy a bottle.  Talk to me about addiction.</p><p>YOUMANS:  So addiction runs through my family.  Alcoholism is probably the most prevalent example of that, and before I made \"Burning Cane\" actually it was when I was 17 in junior year I kind of had a little spout of alcoholism myself because I was always able to grow a beard pretty easily.  And so, I would go up to - go up to like discount stores in the city (inaudible) and get alcohol because they didn't ID me because I looked older.  But I was really kind of self medicating because I was at a particularly low point then.  I was insecure, jealous, and it really kind of sabotaging the relationship I was in.  And then it wasn't making things any better when the girl that I was dating at the time she was also dealing with some sort of alcoholism with her own family and her own father, you know?</p><p>So it was just - there was kind of cycle in that and I recognize that it was self medicating.  And my mother caught me actually a few times.  That why she told me to shave the beard.  After that, you know, as stopped drinking as much.  You know, I stayed away from hard liquor.  And so, I just kind of - I had my own personal experiences with some of the jealously and insecurity and alcoholism that Daniel kind of finds himself with.  All be it, Daniel's is much more magnified</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>And has a much, much harsher context in terms of him being an adult and having to care for his child and all of that.  But what I wanted to really touch on with Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship more than anything in that sort of sphere of alcoholism is just the fact that things can get passed on so easily.</p><p>That's another thing that's sort of cyclical, in the cyclical nature of vices and how they're passed on from generation to generation.  And it's -- that's something that present in the movie not only in alcoholism but also in smoking.</p><p>When it's routine, when it's normalized, it's so easy to let that become a part of your routine and I definitely wanted to touch on that with \"Burning Cane\" and Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The mother Helen was played by Karen Kaia Livers, one of the more complex and dynamic characters in this film.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAREN KAIA LIVERS, ACTRESS:  It was Mr. (inaudible) son Tyde (ph) who helped me to get up.  And by the grace of God, I could walk away.  I was scared I was going to have to be in a wheelchair.  But you know, with the help of the Lord, I'll be fine and I'll survive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's great, mom.  I'm glad to see that you're doing OK.</p><p>LIVERS:  Eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You said Wendell is our lead male character, but the story revolves around Helen and her decisions, her experiences define \"Burning Cane.\"  How so?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, Helen is a character in \"Burning Cane\" that has the major dramatic question that really has the major decision to make.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Which is how does she proceed with knowing the man that her son has become.  And how does she feel as a mother, is there any guilt that she feels for how he's turned out.  And it's also how does she respond, what action does she take to what he's done.  And with--</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is not just his grappling with his alcohol addiction--</p><p>YOUMANS:  No, no, no.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  -- but also with domestic violence.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Yes, yes.  And what I wanted to speak on especially with Helen is that there is a danger in enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion.</p><p>And that by the end of the film, she takes  Tillman's words and his guidance literally and in that, in that very fundamentalist interpretation of what she's saying -- what he says she takes action from that.  But her major question is how does she help the people and the men in her life really that she loves, a pasture, her grandson and her son Daniel.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said my artistic identity is defined by humanizing more than it is by my blackness.  What does that mean?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, I am -- I want to tell honest nuance black stories.  There's an (inaudible) and that is always going to be a part of my work.  But I think above all that, if not even above all of that but in kind of in tandem with that is showcasing the duality and the nuance of our experience.</p><p>But I think there's something important about us being able to as black people be able to tell our stories and be able to show ourselves in that (inaudible) light.  But I think it has to be told from a black perspective to make sure that the humanizing element is still there.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Phillip, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that is a lot of talent packed in to that young man.  And we want to end our program with a tribute to two of Hollywood's grand (inaudible) who have passed on this weekend.</p><p>First, Peggy Lipton, age 72 whose work in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks endeared her to generations.  And whose daughter with Quincy Jones Rashida Jones proves that the apple does not fall too far from the tree.</p><p>And at 97 years old, Doris Day has passed as well.  Her star turns in \"Pillow Talk,\" \"Calamity Jane\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" among many. Many others made the girl next door a Hollywood icon.  Thanks for watching tonight and goodbye from London.  And as Doris Day herself might've said, Que sera, sera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DORIS DAY:  Que sera, sera.  Whatever will be, will be.  The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera.  What will be, will be.  Second verse, when I was just a child--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- in school, I asked my teacher what should I try.</p><p>[13:55:55]  DAY:  Catch</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should I paint pictures?

As Silicon Valley dives ever deeper and deeper into our lives, there are rising calls for oversight. When it comes to regulation, though, Europe is leading the United States. And the summit in Paris this week with tech and world leaders is trying to get to grips with the idea of all-powerful monopolies, invasion of privacy and democracy, the spread of extremism and violence.</p><p>The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is coming to co-chair the meeting and rally support for the Christchurch call, that's a pledge names for the massacres there when a White nationalist mowed down 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques and live streamed it on Facebook. And tomorrow, I'll sit down with the prime minister in Paris to hear about her hopes to eliminate extremism online.</p><p>Ardern's host and co-chair will, of course, be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and he has just met with Mark Zuckerberg, as the Facebook founder continues his worldwide efforts at damage control while rejecting one of his own co-founders calls for Facebook to finally be broken up.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, tech leaders claim they are best placed to self- regulate, and they reject government intervention. I asked the former CEO and chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and Alan Eagle, who is company director, what it would take to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to online content. They join me to discuss their new book, \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" about Bill Campbell, the football coach who became a guru in Silicon Valley because of his teachings on ethical leadership.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, welcome to the program.</p><p>Look, we are talking in a really heightened state of attention on the social giants, the big tech giants. You know that President Macron of France is talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, also to the prime minister of New Zealand in the wake of this horror in Christchurch, which was, to an extent, aided and abetted and supported by violent extremist content online.</p><p>So, what do you think about the state of your big companies right now? Is there room? Is it time to make some dramatic changes in solutions? First, since you were CEO.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER GOOGLE CEO AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\": Well, I always worry about regulation, which is around the current problem and not fixing the real problem. I think it's much better when the tech giants, as you call them, work on solving this themselves. Each company is different.</p><p>In Google's case we worked really, really hard to find and detect evil things that violate our policies and take them down super quickly. There's furthermore promise that A.I. will allow this to be detected automatically.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What about you? I mean, they -- you are giants. I mean, you've dominated the landscape ever since sort of, you know, this started. What do you think? Because everybody says, yes, you know, these companies should regulate themselves. We don't want government, et cetera. But the U.S. is playing catch up to Europe where there is regulation and to a growing clamor amongst people for some kind of more responsible attitude toward what's out there.</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\": I can just tell you from what's going on day-to-day inside the company as a director on the sales team, people are working very hard every day to do the right thing.</p><p>As Eric was talking about, you know, in an open web, it's going to be a constant battle of people putting up bad things and we try to find them and bring them down as quickly as possible. But the company really is trying very hard working very hard on these every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, I'm going to play a soundbite from Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential candidates. And she along with Senator Elizabeth Warren are very clear about what they say they want to do, and that is sort of a breakup of the giant companies. This is what she said recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have to recognize it for what it is, it is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, she is talking sense, right? It's gone unregulated, and to a great degree, I mean, Google, Facebook, all the others, have not done enough, according to her and according to many people, to regulate themselves.</p><p>SCHMIDT: She's also running for president.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Correct.</p><p>SCHMIDT: As is her competitor, Elizabeth Warren. There's no basis in law to break up these companies in the U.S. And fundamentally, the breakup would increase costs. It's far, far better for the companies to try to figure out how to solve this problem.</p><p>The people inside these companies don't want this stuff to happen either. The fact of the matter is that a very small percentage of humans do really bad things. We need to get better at detecting these things and stopping it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What would you then say when you say there's no basis in law or we the companies should do it ourselves and not have government -- what then is a solution?</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, as I said, the computer industry as a whole, and each of the companies, YouTube does a fantastic job of this, detect bad stuff automatically using various mathematical techniques in history and so forth. And the things that are put up are taken down in a very few number of seconds. That's probably the state of the art right now and it's getting better and better.</p><p>I don't know how, in a world where humans can upload over and over again things which are evil, how you can prevent that without having a censorship regime. Do you really want to put in government censors on what people say? I don't think so.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You describe it as censorship. This is what Chris Hughes, I realize he's not a Google employee or founder, but he was one of the founders of Facebook and he's been getting a huge amount of attention because he's said it's time for Mark Zuckerberg's power to be reduced by breaking up Facebook. And particularly, he's talked about readdressing the acquisitions that Facebook made of WhatsApp and Instagram. This is what he just recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: We shouldn't need to just trust the private sector to do the right thing. I mean, we don't do that with airlines, we don't do that with pharmaceutical companies, we don't do that with the financial industry, we don't do that with health care. We say we want competition. We understand that dynamic markets are a good thing, but we want to also ensure that there's a baseline level of protection.</p><p>And the fact we haven't gotten there with digital companies, I think is a testament to how quickly not just Facebook but Google, Amazon, Apple, all of them have grown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: The big four giants. And again, you know, you said there's no basis in law, but there is in -- there's precedent in the United States for breaking up some of these big companies.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Not on --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Antitrust.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Yes. Not under the current set of laws in the U.S. If you follow Chris' arguments, he's fundamentally arguing for very slow rates of innovation. He benefited from the fact that Facebook's entry into an open web allowed the creation of an enormous achievement, which was Facebook at the time. He benefited personally from that.</p><p>Do you really want to slow that down by a factor of 10? Look at the rate of innovation in health care and aviation and industries that he named. I would prefer to have the innovation run forward and then when things happen, let's get together and figure out a way to solve them. Let's figure out how to not prematurely regulate these industries.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I hear you keep saying that and realize you're saying that from your, you know, innovator, business perspective. I understand that. It's also a massively profit-making business, there's no doubt about it. And Chris Hughes, to be fair, does not attack Mark Zuckerberg personally. He says he even thinks that Mark Zuckerberg thinks that he's got too much power and that's just too much power in any democracy.</p><p>Your book, the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\" I mean, you lion eyes this wonderful man, Bill Campbell, who has been so front and center of the Silicon Valley, of the innovation, and also of the ethic. I mean, the book really does focus on his ethic in business.</p><p>How does that fit in to where we are now? I mean, even if you don't like the idea of regulation, because after all, Americans, you know, are unregulatable and we don't like censorship, and entrepreneurship is, you know, has to happen come what may. But surely there is today a common good that does need the kind of ethics that your book focuses on to be involved.</p><p>EAGLE: Well, Bill was a football coach, American football, before he became -- went into business. For him it was all about the team and the good of the team. And so, when he would be looking, we can't assume what he would say today if he were dealing with some of these issues, but what he could look at is, what is the team? Who are the right people working on it, and are they the right people? Are they coachable? Are they people who learn as they go and are they focused on integrity and doing the right thing?</p><p>So, it isn't so much -- he wouldn't talk to us about what should you do, but he'd look at, what is the right team? Is the right team looking at it and do they have the right ethics along with the other traits that (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just wonder what you as people and as tech innovators vested in this company particularly think when you see a Christchurch where it was live streamed and only apparently 4,000 people saw it live but then it was replicated so many times. All of Putin, et cetera, interfering in our laws or the violence against women and other stuff we see.</p><p>SCHMIDT: It's always a shock to discover that there's evil in the world. But the evil was there before Google, Facebook --</p><p>AMANPOUR: But it was never so exponentially distributed.</p><p>SCHMIDT: It was certainly present and that evil now use the latest tools. That doesn't mean that the tools themselves are evil. It means that the toolmakers have to figure out ways to make sure this stuff is not misused.</p><p>In the cases you're citing, it's probably possible to detect this kind of behavior algorithmically that is very quickly. So, when something bad comes up, basically, not only stop it but prevent it from being replicated. YouTube does this quite well.</p><p>YouTube had this problem over a decade. And what would happen is, people who were insane or evil or what have you would keep uploading bad stuff, especially if it was pornographic. And we developed ways to not only to detect it but also prevent it.</p><p>The solution to this is to make sure that the common space follows the guidelines of (INAUDIBLE). None of the companies you named have guidelines which allow the kind of evil you're describing. It's their job, our job, to police that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Correct. I mean, obviously, none of you would allow that kind of stuff. I mean, It's so awful. But just as you said that the internet had to start policing pornography and terrorism as well. I mean, when there's an ISIS thing, people try to take it down or you all try to take it down as quickly as possible.</p><p>SCHMIDT: So, we're clear, all of this content is not okay with any of these companies. There's no company saying, \"Hey, we want more of this.\" They all want less of it. Give us the time to build the systems that detect it but don't otherwise harm innovation and free speech.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, I guess it just always comes back to, particularly in the world that we're living in right now. First of all, it's not just antitrust, it's the wholesale violation of privacy and in some cases, massive technological, you know, surveillance state that in some countries is being enabled by all of this. But it just does go on. I mean, it does, and it is hard for people now to accept that it's a big moneymaker for you all at their cost. Given the fact that it's also massively helpful in so many parts of the endeavor.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, would you prefer these services all charge their actual rates and rather than be free? Would you prefer that they have registered users, as you have in China, where all of a sudden, the government knows exactly what their use is? There are real trade-offs here.</p><p>And while we focus on these exceptions, which are bad exceptions, let's not forget the good, right? These are platforms which are broadly available. There are multibillions of people using them. They've brought enormous benefits of knowledge. If you look at the developing world it has an access to information, access to health care. The empowerment of new competitors and the empowerment of interview entrants. Over and over and over again, the number of companies that have been abled by these technologies is extraordinary.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt about that. However, there is absolutely -- the good news, would you prefer this or that? Well, I belong to a profession that is regulated, you know. And I'm a member of the press with the First Amendment right behind me constitutionally. But nonetheless, there are things we cannot say or do in our profession.</p><p>So, let's get back to the \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" because he is really an interesting man. And when he talks about leadership, which I actually think is fascinating, particularly in this world, what makes a great leader? What -- is it about just winning? Is it about subjugation and dominance? And he -- you quote him or you write about him. He says, \"You need to,\" according to a 1994 study, \"go beyond the traditional notion of managing that focuses on controlling, supervising, evaluating and rewarding/punishing to create a climate of communication, respect, feedback and trust. All through coaching.\"</p><p>Tell me how that plays out then in your experience? What did he teach you all, and how does that come into play in these positions of really huge leadership and power that you have?</p><p>SCHMIDT: So, as you talked about it, these are incredibly stressful and important decisions. And the question is, not what the decision should be. Bill would teach who is taking the decision and how do you get the right people.</p><p>And he would often say the problem is you have the people who think they know the answer. Let's go find the smartest people, get them and work on it really quickly. Over and over again at Google, we found small groups of people who are incredibly expert, who had an idea to solve the problems that you named or others, and we relied on them. The right thing happened.</p><p>What the coach told us was it's a coaching mechanism and it's a team sport, right? Everyone is focused on the leader by name. Everyone knows the famous leaders of these companies and the famous founders, but you forget there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are working with them to collectively make this happen.</p><p>This book is about coaching the whole team. I would argue, by the way, that this is a new Silicon Valley export. The notion of business coaching of the whole team. And the reason is, think about it, in any sport, are there any teams that succeed without coaches? Of course not.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, again, I find the idea of the pyramid, which we all live in a pyramid. We hear at now Warner Media. We have a boss and it filters down. How do you get team members from -- you know, from the lowest up to the highest, to feel that they can safely and securely, as long as they're competent and good and do their job well and all the rest of it, either back up what you're doing or complain or even whistleblower to you, I'm not saying public, but come and talk to you about things that make them uneasy? Because, you know, there's some issues with Google. I mean, the 20,000 people walk out over the allegations of sexual harassment, 50 cities in November.</p><p>EAGLE: I think that was Google culture working at its best.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EAGLE: Because the answer to your question is to listen to people. And you said the word safely, that's what you want. Create a safe place for people to speak up. Eric talked about decision making. When you are making a decision, you may know what the decision already is, you may know what the right thing to do is, but make sure everybody gets heard. People will fall in line with the decision much better, even if it doesn't go their way if they have been actually listened to.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you talked about censorship a moment ago, would you prefer to have censorship? Well, in many places there is censorship like in China and, obviously, Google has come across and come to sort of its accommodation with China.</p><p>You said last year at a private event, Eric, that you predicted we'd see a \"bifurcation\" into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America. And you warned of the danger of leadership in that way from a Chinese government that values censorship. But at the same time, and we've reported this a lot, Google was under heat for its own employees for Project Dragonfly, which is kind of a censored version of a search engine that would, you know, keep certain information away from the Chinese authorities. Where do you come down on that?</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, let's talk about China and the internet for a second. The Chinese internet companies are faster growing and higher valuation than what you call big tech here in the West. They are operating and growing in a separate ecosystem. They have some links outside of China. But China itself is so large, as a business, and they are so successful that they are primarily domestically focused.</p><p>If you talk to the founders of those companies, their primary concern is the government because the government could, for example, arbitrarily decide to not allow them to do a product or so forth and so on. All of them are subject to the very aggressive laws with respect to surveillance, loss of privacy and so forth.</p><p>My concern is that that model not become the internet and my concern is that the internet not split in that way. I think it's very important that Western values of openness and communications and so forth, which we took for granted, are globally available.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So -- I mean, taking what you've just said, are you pleased then that the complaints by Google employees about this, which were verbalized, have apparently put operation Dragonfly either on hold or have ditched it altogether?</p><p>SCHMIDT: So, again, not involved with those decisions. So, I don't know the specifics of the decision. What I can tell you is our culture encourages this kind of expression of interest. The company has to make the decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So -- go ahead.</p><p>EAGLE: I'm pleased that employees felt it was okay to speak up. Whether or not they influenced something or not, they felt empowered, they didn't - - they felt something that wasn't going right at the company or at least in their opinion it wasn't, and they felt they could speak up about it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And in fact, the current CEO, Sundar Pichai, says it was merely an internal project. He's denied any plans to launch one in China and says the project has since been dropped. Bill Campbell, would he have agreed with that? Are you pleased that it's been dropped, whatever was going on?</p><p>EAGLE: Again, I'm pleased people felt empowered to talk up about it, speak up about it and that they were listened to, regardless of the issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What is the biggest takeaway in terms of management between leaders and employees that we -- that you hope you take from this book?</p><p>SCHMIDT: The basic principle is bring humanity back into the workplace. Respect, listening, caring about people, helping them achieve their objectives. This is what Bill was all about.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that could be an exponential game changer because still, to this day, the little people are still nervous about their jobs should they feel that they're part of the project and feel empowered and then get themselves slapped around.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, and the book is called \"Trillion Dollar Coach\" because Bill was both Steve Jobs' coach --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT: -- as well as my coach, and the sum of that is more than a trillion dollars of shareholder value. He's by far the most successful coach in the world. And at Google, and I suspect at Apple, you would never be able refer to our employees as little people, right? Our model --</p><p>AMANPOUR: I'm talking about on the totem pole.</p><p>SCHMIDT: I'm -- our model is huge empowerment to our individual employees, which I'm very proud of.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What did you get from him, from Bill? I know he was your coach. And also, wasn't Steve Jobs a little bit sort of nervous about Bill coaching all the competitors as well?</p><p>SCHMIDT: Well, what's interesting about Bill is he managed to actually coach not just Apple and Google but many other companies in the Valley. And he managed to do this because he was not involved in the product decisions. He let the product decisions, which often were very complicated and different, stay separate. He coached them, people, as individuals.</p><p>And somehow in the middle of all of the conflict between Apple and Google, he managed to do it and did it fairly to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>EAGLE: And he built incredible trust, again, by listening, by being loyal, by being, you know, very careful with keeping secrets and he just built tremendous trust. So, he could work with many different players.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Excellent. Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHMIDT: OK. Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The book is the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"</p><p>SCHMIDT: Thank you.</p><p>EAGLE: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And now, we're going to take a cue from Shakespeare and his eternally timely, \"King Lear.\" It too is all about power, a team of rivals and a big breakup of his kingdom no less.</p><p>Lear's decent into madness makes him one of the most challenging characters to grapple with on stage. The latest actor taking up the gauntlet is Glenda Jackson. At 83 years old, she's showing no signs of slowing down as she throws herself into eight shows a week on Broadway.</p><p>Fierce, funny and frank, it's a delight to welcome her back to this program between, of course, shows. There you are in New York.</p><p>Welcome back, Glenda Jackson.</p><p>JACKSON: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It is exhaust, right? I mean, it's very physical and all- encompassing performance.</p><p>JACKSON: Well, it is and it isn't. I mean, I'm used to eight shows a week. I mean, that was the work toll, that it was practiced in England when I began and still is. But there is enormous energy in the play itself. And if you can touch into that energy, and we do as a company, then, really, I mean, I sometimes feel more energized when it's -- when we've done it than when I started.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I wonder whether -- because you've also said that you think, you know, Shakespeare is perhaps one of the most, if not the most contemporary of playwrights. And given all --</p><p>JACKSON: Oh, he is. Undoubtedly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. And we've just been talking about leadership --</p><p>JACKSON: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and power and corruption and breakup and ethics. Where does he fit in for you? Why do you call him still so contemporary?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, because he essentially only ever writes about us, about human beings. And human nature is immutable. Yes, we can and we do when we're still trying to improve the human condition. But we, as human beings, don't change that much. And there are tropes in the play that are absolutely reflected in the world as we know it today.</p><p>When I was particularly interested hearing the previous piece about power and leadership because Lear says in the play that he was flattered like a dog as the king. People said to him aye and no to everything he said. And the line is, \"Aye and no, too, is no good divinity.\" And so, that is something that is still prevalent now.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, continuing that theme, this particular production of \"King Lear\" takes place, essentially in a single kind of gilded room. And --</p><p>JACKSON: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- you know, it then turns into a bit of a ruin in the second part. But nonetheless, as you can imagine, given the times we're living in, some of the theater critics have said, \"Well, that room, that sort of - - that room must be Trumpian. It must be the Trump tower conference room.\" I mean, do you ever think about that? Is there any kind of truth to that at all?</p><p>JACKSON: I think there may have been something there in the background but certainly, Lear is not that kind of person. I mean, the point about Lear is that he's a man who no one has ever said no to in his entire life. He was born to that position of power. He's, obviously, conducted it well. He says he's handing it over to younger strength than his because he wants to have a peaceful retirement, ideally with his youngest, most favorite daughter in probably the most favorite place in this kingdom. And it doesn't happen like that.</p><p>And so, what he has known all his life begins in the most terrible way to fracture, to fall apart, to finish. But his power is never something that he's had to question or has been questioned until this critical moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, we're going to be playing now a little clip because it has been filmed. And we've been talking about ethics. And he's now losing his faculties, but he's got one sort of clear moment and here it is. Here's you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON: Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are. That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm. How shall your houseless heads, your own [phonetic], your looped and windowed raggedness, defend me from seasons such as this. Aaah! I have ta-en to little care of this. Take physic pomp. Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, that last line essentially says it all, \"Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.\" Talk to me a little bit about that.</p><p>JACKSON: It resonates particularly with me because when I was first elected a Member of Parliament, I think virtually every shop doorway in London and possibly in every metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, was the bedroom, living room and bathroom of some homeless person. There had been major, major changes made in our social housing structures by the Then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed tenants to buy their properties usually at way below market prices.</p><p>And there was no recompense in replacing those -- that social housing foundation with new social housing. And although the number of people who were homeless in my country went down, we are now seeing those numbers going up. And certainly, here in New York, we see people on the streets every night.</p><p>And it is that, for him, for -- certainly for Lear, he makes that connection. And I'm truly certain it is the first time in his life. I'm pretty certain he thought all the time before then, but no word, if these people don't have anywhere to live it's because they're too idle to work. You would find that opinion being replicated even now.</p><p>It suddenly strikes home to him because he suddenly, in the strange kind of way, realizes that he has no home. He has nowhere to live. And it's that acknowledgment that when he had the power to do something, essentially, you prevent that situation, he ducked out of it. He wasn't aware of it, actually. I think that is a moment of genuine shame for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really interesting because it's sort of builds on that theme, your -- King Lear's good friend, the Earl of Gloucester, who is also brought down by a disloyal child, he also finds himself, at one point, being confronted by a poor mentally ill man in the streets, and he gives him some money in the account (ph) and he says, \"So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.\" I mean, you know, contemporarily, that would be redistribution of wealth.</p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely, it would, yes. And look how hard that is, and becoming harder, it would seem.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But it is incredible that those themes, I mean, as you say, they are so contemporary and so eternal.</p><p>JACKSON: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Look, we make a big deal, I don't know why, about saying you're 83 years old and you're still doing this. However, I think one of the reasons is the admiration that you still have so much gusto and so much, you know, spark on stage and get such great reviews and pulling in such audiences. But also, I wonder whether Lear has to be played in your later years, in a later year.</p><p>And I just want you to think about that while I play something -- I hate to name drop, but I did interview Sir Ian McKellen and he played it on stage in London and talked about this connection between age and Lear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN MCKELLEN, ACTOR: Well, there was a great actor in my youth, Ralph Richardson, a film star and stage star, who said in his typical wry, witty way, you get out of bed, it's a beautiful day. The birds are tweeting, the sun is in the sky. Your wife is being nice to you. Nothing could go wrong. And then, oh, you finally got your foot caught in a Lear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, it's kind of sweet they way he says it, but just this sort of inevitability, if you have the talent to play this in your -- in your -- in your later years, did you feel caught in a lear?</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTOR: No, because the I don't -- Lear doesn't regard himself as being old. I mean, he only acknowledges his age right at the end of the play and the part itself, actually, it demands energy. I mean, it's not an old man's part in what was the kind of, oh I don't know, I mean, we're so hypocritical aren't we, as people, about age?</p><p>I mean, I remember when state pension age in my country was 65 and you expected suddenly, the day after you were 65 to have lost all the powers of understanding, not be able to walk, I mean, it's just ridiculous you know.</p><p>I mean, my birthday was last week. I think I'm exactly the same the day after my birthday than I was before, but this thing about age is something -- I mean, you allow it to work into energy.</p><p>I -- one of the things I treasure most in my life is that by the accident of my birth, I was born in what we used to call the working classes, we're now called blue collar, I -- it was very simple for that class. If you didn't work, you didn't eat. And so, I have a very, very strong work ethic and I bless -- I bless my family for giving me that inheritance because it's been of immense value to me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And it's great actually, I just want to also -- there is so much ageism in society and sexism in society and here you are a woman of a certain age, and by the way happy birthday, not just playing this part, but also playing it as a woman.</p><p>And I think you were the -- well, one of the first women. I think Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in, obviously, in the last century, but nonetheless, what you do make of that? Did you ever get any misogynistic backlash?</p><p>JACKSON: None whatever. I mean, it is very, very rare. I can't think anyone who's actually seen the play with me in it has raised that issue at all. I mean, it may be -- we did have a gender bender battle in England and that has been triumphantly won by the group of actresses who created a company and kicked off that battle playing all the Shakespearean histories, all women casts, I think that battle, in the sense, has been won.</p><p>One of the touching things that was said to me -- no one has really, because I don't play it as a woman in that sense. I mean one of the benefits of my being a member of</p><p>Parliament was that I visited old people's homes, day centers, places that helped people with disabilities and things of that nature, and we are, as a race, a breed, whatever you like to call us, living longer and longer and one of the fascinating things that I saw was that as we do get older, there's absolute boundaries that define our gender begin to crack, they begin to fray.</p><p>I mean we are taught, are we not, to be boys or girls. Babies, when they're born, they don't know what their gender is and as we get older they begin to be filtrated by something else and that's very useful.</p><p>But one of the audience members who waited outside the theater one night said to me, I've seen this play many, many times and it's the first time I've seen an aspect of Lear that could have a maternal quality. I don't play that maternal quality, but it is, undoubtedly, in there.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's is such -- that is really impressive.</p><p>JACKSON: . brilliant Mr. Shakespeare, isn't it?</p><p>AMANPOUR: It is.</p><p>JACKSON: . just fascinating.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, that really is. And we had the opportunity to talk to Kate Pakenham who was head of the Donmar Warehouse, who did that trilogy, of course, as you said, there's Julius Caesar and two others, all women casts and it was amazing. But she did say, because perhaps she was the first there was quite a lot of backlash here in Britain.</p><p>And we've also explore a lot on this show about work and sort of useful contribution to society, even beyond the retiring age. So, I think you're absolutely right, these issues are happening.</p><p>But I want to play another clip from something you did much, much earlier. Essentially it's -- it's -- I mean, it's got a long, long title, but it's the -- the -- the movie \"Marat/Sade\" and we're going to take a clip of your performance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON: Why are they housing (ph)? What are they dragging through the streets? They carry stakes, but what's impaled on those stakes? What do they have? What are they dancing for? Why are they wrapped with laughter? Why do the children scream? What are those heaps they fight over? Those heaps with eyes and mouths? What kind of town is this?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: You do -- you do mad very well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JACKSON: Well, I'll say thank you, even though I have my doubts, but thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, but it is interesting that -- I mean there's that much earlier in your career, there's this we show, two clips where you're really showing the frailties, the decent into madness, mental illness. I mean, how do you -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>JACKSON: Well, what I was going to say is, both of those examples where set in times. I mean, certainly, the \"Marat/Sade\" was set in a specific time. Shakespeare wrote his play in a specific time where the use of medicine was not there as a calming influence on people were having serious mental health problems and I think that is reflection. So it's -- I mean, I think one of the areas which is very different today is that increase of medicinal calming. I mean, I use that word, I mean it's the wrong word, but you know what I mean.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I do. I do know what you mean, and very briefly, we've only got about a minute left. You said that, in a recent radio interview, you said you think the inside me is about 15-years-old.</p><p>JACKSON: Yes. That's true, I do. It's the envelop which carries our inside us that is increasingly disobedient. Fingers don't do what you tell them to do, knees don't bend when you want them to do and the other amazing thing about reaching the age that I have is I -- I'm suddenly blinding aware of how little I know and how much there is that I would like to know. So, I have a bit more time and can perhaps can close up those areas of total ignorance.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what would be your next dream role, what happens after \"Lear\" for you?</p><p>JACKSON: Oh, look, I mean I remember all those years when there was no work available and one was just desperate for it. So, anything that comes through the front door that is something is welcome. I've always felt, when a job finishes, that I'm never going to be employed again. Let's hope that I can be wrong. That's that one of the things that I hope I learn.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I'm sure you are wrong. Glenda Jackson, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACKSON: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And now we turn to a new kid on the block, a teenage filmmaker just starting out, but already making waves. He's 19-year-old Phillip Youmans. His first feature, \"Burning Cane\" snapped up three awards at this year's Tribecca Film Festival. The film is set in rural Louisiana and it tells a story of a deeply religious woman and her struggle to reconcile her faith with the love that she holds for her alcoholic son and a troubled preacher.</p><p>Phillip Youmans has now made history as the youngest director to feature in the festival and the first African-American to win the top prize. And our Alicia Menendez spoke to him about the story behind his amazing story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Phillip, thank you so much for joining us. Congratulations on your recent honor.</p><p>PHILLIP YOUMAN, FILMMAKER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Tell me what this film \"Burning Cane\" is about?</p><p>YOUMAN: So, \"Burning Cane\" is about Helen Wayne (ph) a mother living in rural Louisiana. Her son, Daniel and his son Jeremiah and also her pastor, Reverend Tillman (ph) and their relationships with each other, their relationships with their religion and their community and how their environment and their home effects really every aspect in the fabric of their lives. It's about how religion, it sort of governs their community. It's about the cyclical nature of destructive behavior and how vices are passed down in lineage very often.</p><p>And it's also about the dangers of enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion and then taking religious doctrine (ph) literally.</p><p>MENENDEZ: What is the meaning behind the title of the film, \"Burning Cane?\"</p><p>YOUMAN: Burning cane is a part of harvesting cane, but -- and it's a part of the culture and the fabric of the entire process in the community.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Sugar cane?</p><p>YOUMAN: Sugar cane. But, it also releases toxins that are very negative for people's health. And so, I think there's just an interesting sort of a dichotomy there, in that it is such an important part of their economy about -- it's -- and sugar cane in that -- in that -- in that industry is an important part of the culture and the fabric of that area, but it is also detrimental to their health in terms of the toxins that are released in the air because of it.</p><p>So, and I feel like that sort of touches on the sort -- the multi- dimensionality of all the characters that kind of populate the film.</p><p>MENENDEZ: You finished this film up during your senior year of high school, 17-years-old. Tell me about the process of making this film.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>YOUMANS: So it started when I was 16. In the December of my junior year of high school I wrote this short script called \"The Glory\", and then I wanted to make that short, but I stepped away to make another short. And then after that, my instructor at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts named Isaac Webb told me that he thought that the film had feature length potential because of the fact that it was so grounded in character, that it seemed like it could be something that could be made feasibly. And so, I just because like obsessed with that idea. And then in the ensuing weeks and months I was just churning out drafts of the feature length script, going through script revisions, meeting actors all the while raising money and casting.</p><p>And then so in that summer before my senior year, we went into production and shot the bulk of principal photography and then shot Wendell's piece in that August, and then the rest of senior year was spent in post production.</p><p>MENENDEZ: For someone who doesn't go to an elite school like the one that you went to, how do you make a film like this?</p><p>YOUMANS: I think at my age when we made this film, I relied so much on the fact that the artists that were my friends and a lot of my friends who weren't artists were just really behind my mission and my drive. And when you can't pay people industry rate, especially when we were that young, you have to rely on people wanting to work for you regardless or wanting to work with you because they believe in your and they believe in the project. And for me in that case, those are my friends. So I've actually been telling people recently that I feel like if you're as young as I was making a film, I think you really do have to kind of rely on your friends and your community in a way to ban together and help you figure out some of those resource and some of those jobs.</p><p>MENENDEZ: You've said, \"I think now is probably the best time for \"Burning Cane\" to come out. Why now?</p><p>YOUMANS: Well, there is - there is - there is two parts to that. I think that just - I think it's time for us to kind of take an objective look just at religion and its role in our community and how it plays into our advancement as a community. And I also think in terms of making this, you know, in more like applicable sense I had to make the film then and now because of the fact that there was such a community around me that there was no other time that I was going to be able to rely on people's good will quite like I could then because the moment you turn 18, then you're an adult and people expect and entirely different thing, you know?</p><p>So when I was 18, we were already in post production, but when I was 17 I think we kind of - we were aware of the fact that people thought that we were just a student production and in that they were willing to give so much because they thought they were just helping out some kids. And we were, you know, young, but we always envisioned this going farther than just, you know, a student project.</p><p>MENENDEZ: There's a clip I want to watch. It comes very early in the film, and it is Wendell Pierce giving his first sermon that we see in the film. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WENDELL PIERCE: Now however it says he has died, he has learned that is not to be true. That's not true. He who dies with the most toys wins. You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don't mean nothing if you're going to lose your soul. He who dies with the most toys wins. He knows that's not to be true because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn't get him across Jordan into heaven. No toys gets you into heaven. It's the friendships that you have. It's the kindness that you do. Did you clothe me when I was naked? Did you give me housing when I had no place to live? Did you feed me when I was hungry? Did you drink - give me water to drink when I was thirsty? He who dies with the most toys wins. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ: Talk to me about the dichotomy of cutting between this sermon and then this man reckoning with his won demons?</p><p>YOUMANS: There's some truth to what Tillman says in that sermon in that he believes that friendships and personal relationships are more valuable than material possessions, and I think most of us can kind of agree with that. And I just kind of wanted to show the fact that there can be some truth that comes from this man and he can also still be broken. He can still be a beacon for people that may oral status (ph) that pastors have but still be grappling with all those same demons on his own. And it just brings about the question of whether or not we should be following anybody who can't really practice what they preach, but we should - should we even expect anyone to be able to do that? That's a whole other question, you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ: How did you convince Wendell Pierce to be apart of this film?</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>YOUMANS: Well, I - so in the - in the - on the months leading up to preproduction - well, in the months leading up to production actually, I was working at Morning Call Coffee Stand in City Park and I was waiting on a woman named Lula Elzy who's also an alumni of the same high school that Wendell and I went to - the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. And I went up to Ms. Elzy and I was waiting on her table. And she asked me about what I wanted to do, what school I went to. And then I was talking to her about some of the roles in the project. I told her that we had casted pretty much every role except this preacher, and I was just kind of explaining, you know, the preacher's motivations, where he was in this life.</p><p>And she said, \"what do you think of Wendell Pierce playing the role?\" And of course I like freaked out, you know, because is Wendell is so - is big in our community not only because he's a brilliant actor, but because of - because of the work that he's done in Pontchartrain Park where he grew up, you know, and sort of helping stop all the gentrification that was coming through that area. And then she texted him right in that moment and he responded to her quickly. I think she said like, \"there's a (noka) student who's shooting a feature film this summer.</p><p>He's interested in seeing you play this role.\" And he was like, \"OK, give him my email.\" And so, I got his email and after that it was really just a back and forth with the script trying to make dates work, you know, looping him into all script revisions and - but Wendell coming in, it helped expand the community because initially the film was so much more centered on Daniel and Helen's relationship as a mother and son. What Wendell came in and allowed is to kind of build this entire portrait as a community and show - and show how Helen's religion and the people that she associates with her religion, how they directly affect her actions with her loved ones and her family. So it's just - it allowed the entire story, the entire community of Laurel Valley to be flushed out.</p><p>MENENDEZ: How did working with Wendell change you as a director?</p><p>YOUMANS: I think before working with Wendell or even before \"Burning Cane\" I had - I had kind of a messed up idea about what directing was.</p><p>MENENDEZ: What did you think it was?</p><p>YOUMANS: I thought it was so much more, you know, commanding, so much more - so much more authoritarian than it really is and than it really should be. It's so much more about the conversations that you have and sometimes maybe even the conversations that you have before you even show up to set, you know? And I think what working with Wendell and Kaia and Dominique kind of taught me is that they're brilliant actors and you have to give brilliant actors the space to create alongside you. It was just a - it was just a back and forth, you know, dialogue, and I mean, he made all the great choices, so it's - yes, it worked out.</p><p>MENENDEZ: He's not the only character in the film that struggles with addiction. Let's take a look at another clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ: The main character, this is her son dancing around with his son, passes the little boy a bottle. Talk to me about addiction.</p><p>YOUMANS: So addiction runs through my family. Alcoholism is probably the most prevalent example of that, and before I made \"Burning Cane\" actually it was when I was 17 in junior year I kind of had a little spout of alcoholism myself because I was always able to grow a beard pretty easily. And so, I would go up to - go up to like discount stores in the city (inaudible) and get alcohol because they didn't ID me because I looked older. But I was really kind of self medicating because I was at a particularly low point then. I was insecure, jealous, and it really kind of sabotaging the relationship I was in. And then it wasn't making things any better when the girl that I was dating at the time she was also dealing with some sort of alcoholism with her own family and her own father, you know?</p><p>So it was just - there was kind of cycle in that and I recognize that it was self medicating. And my mother caught me actually a few times. That why she told me to shave the beard. After that, you know, as stopped drinking as much. You know, I stayed away from hard liquor. And so, I just kind of - I had my own personal experiences with some of the jealously and insecurity and alcoholism that Daniel kind of finds himself with. All be it, Daniel's is much more magnified</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>And has a much, much harsher context in terms of him being an adult and having to care for his child and all of that. But what I wanted to really touch on with Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship more than anything in that sort of sphere of alcoholism is just the fact that things can get passed on so easily.</p><p>That's another thing that's sort of cyclical, in the cyclical nature of vices and how they're passed on from generation to generation. And it's -- that's something that present in the movie not only in alcoholism but also in smoking.</p><p>When it's routine, when it's normalized, it's so easy to let that become a part of your routine and I definitely wanted to touch on that with \"Burning Cane\" and Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship.</p><p>MENENDEZ: The mother Helen was played by Karen Kaia Livers, one of the more complex and dynamic characters in this film. Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAREN KAIA LIVERS, ACTRESS: It was Mr. (inaudible) son Tyde (ph) who helped me to get up. And by the grace of God, I could walk away. I was scared I was going to have to be in a wheelchair. But you know, with the help of the Lord, I'll be fine and I'll survive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's great, mom. I'm glad to see that you're doing OK.</p><p>LIVERS: Eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ: You said Wendell is our lead male character, but the story revolves around Helen and her decisions, her experiences define \"Burning Cane.\" How so?</p><p>YOUMANS: So, Helen is a character in \"Burning Cane\" that has the major dramatic question that really has the major decision to make.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Which is?</p><p>YOUMANS: Which is how does she proceed with knowing the man that her son has become. And how does she feel as a mother, is there any guilt that she feels for how he's turned out. And it's also how does she respond, what action does she take to what he's done. And with--</p><p>MENENDEZ: Which is not just his grappling with his alcohol addiction--</p><p>YOUMANS: No, no, no.</p><p>MENENDEZ: -- but also with domestic violence.</p><p>YOUMANS: Yes, yes. And what I wanted to speak on especially with Helen is that there is a danger in enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion.</p><p>And that by the end of the film, she takes Tillman's words and his guidance literally and in that, in that very fundamentalist interpretation of what she's saying -- what he says she takes action from that. But her major question is how does she help the people and the men in her life really that she loves, a pasture, her grandson and her son Daniel.</p><p>MENENDEZ: You've said my artistic identity is defined by humanizing more than it is by my blackness. What does that mean?</p><p>YOUMANS: So, I am -- I want to tell honest nuance black stories. There's an (inaudible) and that is always going to be a part of my work. But I think above all that, if not even above all of that but in kind of in tandem with that is showcasing the duality and the nuance of our experience.</p><p>But I think there's something important about us being able to as black people be able to tell our stories and be able to show ourselves in that (inaudible) light. But I think it has to be told from a black perspective to make sure that the humanizing element is still there.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Phillip, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUMANS: Hey, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that is a lot of talent packed in to that young man. And we want to end our program with a tribute to two of Hollywood's grand (inaudible) who have passed on this weekend.</p><p>First, Peggy Lipton, age 72 whose work in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks endeared her to generations. And whose daughter with Quincy Jones Rashida Jones proves that the apple does not fall too far from the tree.</p><p>And at 97 years old, Doris Day has passed as well. Her star turns in \"Pillow Talk,\" \"Calamity Jane\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" among many. Many others made the girl next door a Hollywood icon. Thanks for watching tonight and goodbye from London. And as Doris Day herself might've said, Que sera, sera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DORIS DAY: Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be.

So, should giant tech companies be broken up now to protect the common good?  I'm joined by Google's former CE, Eric Schmidt, and one of its current directors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTRESS, \"KING LEAR\":  Expose yourself to fear.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Power and politics in the court of \"King Lear\".  Legendary actress, Glenda Jackson, has been taking Broadway by storm, gender bending Shakespeare's tragic hero at 83.</p><p>Then, the new kid on the block, 19-year-old director, Phillip Youmans, makes history at the Tribeca Film Festival and sits down with our Alicia Menendez to tell his amazing story.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>So, has big tech finally just gotten too big and too powerful?  As Silicon Valley dives ever deeper and deeper into our lives, there are rising calls for oversight.  When it comes to regulation, though, Europe is leading the United States.  And the summit in Paris this week with tech and world leaders is trying to get to grips with the idea of all-powerful monopolies, invasion of privacy and democracy, the spread of extremism and violence.</p><p>The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is coming to co-chair the meeting and rally support for the Christchurch call, that's a pledge names for the massacres there when a White nationalist mowed down 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques and live streamed it on Facebook.  And tomorrow, I'll sit down with the prime minister in Paris to hear about her hopes to eliminate extremism online.</p><p>Ardern's host and co-chair will, of course, be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and he has just met with Mark Zuckerberg, as the Facebook founder continues his worldwide efforts at damage control while rejecting one of his own co-founders calls for Facebook to finally be broken up.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, tech leaders claim they are best placed to self-regulate, and they reject government intervention.  I asked the former CEO and chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and Alan Eagle, who is company director, what it would take to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to online content.  They join me to discuss their new book, \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" about Bill Campbell, the football coach who became a guru in Silicon Valley because of his teachings on ethical leadership.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, welcome to the program.</p><p>Look, we are talking in a really heightened state of attention on the social giants, the big tech giants.  You know that President Macron of France is talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, also to the prime minister of New Zealand in the wake of this horror in Christchurch, which was, to an extent, aided and abetted and supported by violent extremist content online.</p><p>So, what do you think about the state of your big companies right now?  Is there room?  Is it time to make some dramatic changes in solutions?  First, since you were CEO.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER GOOGLE CEO AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  Well, I always worry about regulation, which is around the current problem and not fixing the real problem.  I think it's much better when the tech giants, as you call them, work on solving this themselves.  Each company is different.</p><p>In Google's case we worked really, really hard to find and detect evil things that violate our policies and take them down super quickly.  There's furthermore promise that A.I. will allow this to be detected automatically.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What about you?  I mean, they -- you are giants.  I mean, you've dominated the landscape ever since sort of, you know, this started.  What do you think?  Because everybody says, yes, you know, these companies should regulate themselves.  We don't want government, et cetera.  But the U.S. is playing catch up to Europe where there is regulation and to a growing clamor amongst people for some kind of more responsible attitude toward what's out there.</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  I can just tell you from what's going on day-to-day inside the company as a director on the sales team, people are working very hard every day to do the right thing.</p><p>As Eric was talking about, you know, in an open web, it's going to be a constant battle of people putting up bad things and we try to find them and bring them down as quickly as possible.  But the company really is trying very hard working very hard on these every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, I'm going to play a soundbite from Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential candidates.  And she along with Senator Elizabeth Warren are very clear about what they say they want to do, and that is sort of a breakup of the giant companies.  This is what she said recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have to recognize it for what it is, it is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.  And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, she is talking sense, right?  It's gone unregulated, and to a great degree, I mean, Google, Facebook, all the others, have not done enough, according to her and according to many people, to regulate themselves.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  She's also running for president.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  As is her competitor, Elizabeth Warren.  There's no basis in law to break up these companies in the U.S.  And fundamentally, the breakup would increase costs.  It's far, far better for the companies to try to figure out how to solve this problem.</p><p>The people inside these companies don't want this stuff to happen either.  The fact of the matter is that a very small percentage of humans do really bad things.  We need to get better at detecting these things and stopping it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What would you then say when you say there's no basis in law or we the companies should do it ourselves and not have government -- what then is a solution?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, as I said, the computer industry as a whole, and each of the companies, YouTube does a fantastic job of this, detect bad stuff automatically using various mathematical techniques in history and so forth.  And the things that are put up are taken down in a very few number of seconds.  That's probably the state of the art right now and it's getting better and better.</p><p>I don't know how, in a world where humans can upload over and over again things which are evil, how you can prevent that without having a censorship regime.  Do you really want to put in government censors on what people say?  I don't think so.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You describe it as censorship.  This is what Chris Hughes, I realize he's not a Google employee or founder, but he was one of the founders of Facebook and he's been getting a huge amount of attention because he's said it's time for Mark Zuckerberg's power to be reduced by breaking up Facebook.  And particularly, he's talked about readdressing the acquisitions that Facebook made of WhatsApp and Instagram.  This is what he just recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  We shouldn't need to just trust the private sector to do the right thing.  I mean, we don't do that with airlines, we don't do that with pharmaceutical companies, we don't do that with the financial industry, we don't do that with health care.  We say we want competition.  We understand that dynamic markets are a good thing, but we want to also ensure that there's a baseline level of protection.</p><p>And the fact we haven't gotten there with digital companies, I think is a testament to how quickly not just Facebook but Google, Amazon, Apple, all of them have grown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The big four giants.  And again, you know, you said there's no basis in law, but there is in -- there's precedent in the United States for breaking up some of these big companies.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Not on --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Antitrust.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Not under the current set of laws in the U.S.  If you follow Chris' arguments, he's fundamentally arguing for very slow rates of innovation.  He benefited from the fact that Facebook's entry into an open web allowed the creation of an enormous achievement, which was Facebook at the time.  He benefited personally from that.</p><p>Do you really want to slow that down by a factor of 10?  Look at the rate of innovation in health care and aviation and industries that he named.  I would prefer to have the innovation run forward and then when things happen, let's get together and figure out a way to solve them.  Let's figure out how to not prematurely regulate these industries.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I hear you keep saying that and realize you're saying that from your, you know, innovator, business perspective.  I understand that.  It's also a massively profit-making business, there's no doubt about it.  And Chris Hughes, to be fair, does not attack Mark Zuckerberg personally.  He says he even thinks that Mark Zuckerberg thinks that he's got too much power and that's just too much power in any democracy.</p><p>Your book, the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"  I mean, you lion eyes this wonderful man, Bill Campbell, who has been so front and center of the Silicon Valley, of the innovation, and also of the ethic.  I mean, the book really does focus on his ethic in business.</p><p>How does that fit in to where we are now?  I mean, even if you don't like the idea of regulation, because after all, Americans, you know, are unregulatable and we don't like censorship, and entrepreneurship is, you know, has to happen come what may.  But surely there is today a common good that does need the kind of ethics that your book focuses on to be involved.</p><p>EAGLE:  Well, Bill was a football coach, American football, before he became -- went into business.  For him it was all about the team and the good of the team.  And so, when he would be looking, we can't assume what he would say today if he were dealing with some of these issues, but what he could look at is, what is the team?  Who are the right people working on it, and are they the right people?  Are they coachable?  Are they people who learn as they go and are they focused on integrity and doing the right thing?</p><p>So, it isn't so much -- he wouldn't talk to us about what should you do, but he'd look at, what is the right team?  Is the right team looking at it and do they have the right ethics along with the other traits that (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I just wonder what you as people and as tech innovators vested in this company particularly think when you see a Christchurch where it was live streamed and only apparently 4,000 people saw it live but then it was replicated so many times.  All of Putin, et cetera, interfering in our laws or the violence against women and other stuff we see.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It's always a shock to discover that there's evil in the world.  But the evil was there before Google, Facebook --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it was never so exponentially distributed.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It was certainly present and that evil now use the latest tools.  That doesn't mean that the tools themselves are evil.  It means that the toolmakers have to figure out ways to make sure this stuff is not misused.</p><p>In the cases you're citing, it's probably possible to detect this kind of behavior algorithmically that is very quickly.  So, when something bad comes up, basically, not only stop it but prevent it from being replicated.  YouTube does this quite well.</p><p>YouTube had this problem over a decade.  And what would happen is, people who were insane or evil or what have you would keep uploading bad stuff, especially if it was pornographic.  And we developed ways to not only to detect it but also prevent it.</p><p>The solution to this is to make sure that the common space follows the guidelines of (INAUDIBLE).  None of the companies you named have guidelines which allow the kind of evil you're describing.  It's their job, our job, to police that.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.  I mean, obviously, none of you would allow that kind of stuff.  I mean, It's so awful.  But just as you said that the internet had to start policing pornography and terrorism as well.  I mean, when there's an ISIS thing, people try to take it down or you all try to take it down as quickly as possible.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, we're clear, all of this content is not okay with any of these companies.  There's no company saying, \"Hey, we want more of this.\"  They all want less of it.  Give us the time to build the systems that detect it but don't otherwise harm innovation and free speech.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, I guess it just always comes back to, particularly in the world that we're living in right now.  First of all, it's not just antitrust, it's the wholesale violation of privacy and in some cases, massive technological, you know, surveillance state that in some countries is being enabled by all of this.  But it just does go on.  I mean, it does, and it is hard for people now to accept that it's a big moneymaker for you all at their cost.  Given the fact that it's also massively helpful in so many parts of the endeavor.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, would you prefer these services all charge their actual rates and rather than be free?  Would you prefer that they have registered users, as you have in China, where all of a sudden, the government knows exactly what their use is?  There are real trade-offs here.</p><p>And while we focus on these exceptions, which are bad exceptions, let's not forget the good, right?  These are platforms which are broadly available.  There are multibillions of people using them.  They've brought enormous benefits of knowledge.  If you look at the developing world it has an access to information, access to health care.  The empowerment of new competitors and the empowerment of interview entrants.  Over and over and over again, the number of companies that have been abled by these technologies is extraordinary.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt about that.  However, there is absolutely -- the good news, would you prefer this or that?  Well, I belong to a profession that is regulated, you know.  And I'm a member of the press with the First Amendment right behind me constitutionally.  But nonetheless, there are things we cannot say or do in our profession.</p><p>So, let's get back to the \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" because he is really an interesting man.  And when he talks about leadership, which I actually think is fascinating, particularly in this world, what makes a great leader?  What -- is it about just winning?  Is it about subjugation and dominance?  And he -- you quote him or you write about him.  He says, \"You need to,\" according to a 1994 study, \"go beyond the traditional notion of managing that focuses on controlling, supervising, evaluating and rewarding/punishing to create a climate of communication, respect, feedback and trust.  All through coaching.\"</p><p>Tell me how that plays out then in your experience?  What did he teach you all, and how does that come into play in these positions of really huge leadership and power that you have?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, as you talked about it, these are incredibly stressful and important decisions.  And the question is, not what the decision should be.  Bill would teach who is taking the decision and how do you get the right people.</p><p>And he would often say the problem is you have the people who think they know the answer.  Let's go find the smartest people, get them and work on it really quickly.  Over and over again at Google, we found small groups of people who are incredibly expert, who had an idea to solve the problems that you named or others, and we relied on them.  The right thing happened.</p><p>What the coach told us was it's a coaching mechanism and it's a team sport, right?  Everyone is focused on the leader by name.  Everyone knows the famous leaders of these companies and the famous founders, but you forget there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are working with them to collectively make this happen.</p><p>This book is about coaching the whole team.  I would argue, by the way, that this is a new Silicon Valley export.  The notion of business coaching of the whole team.  And the reason is, think about it, in any sport, are there any teams that succeed without coaches?  Of course not.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, again, I find the idea of the pyramid, which we all live in a pyramid.  We hear at now Warner Media.  We have a boss and it filters down.  How do you get team members from -- you know, from the lowest up to the highest, to feel that they can safely and securely, as long as they're competent and good and do their job well and all the rest of it, either back up what you're doing or complain or even whistleblower to you, I'm not saying public, but come and talk to you about things that make them uneasy?  Because, you know, there's some issues with Google.  I mean, the 20,000 people walk out over the allegations of sexual harassment, 50 cities in November.</p><p>EAGLE:  I think that was Google culture working at its best.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EAGLE:  Because the answer to your question is to listen to people.  And you said the word safely, that's what you want.  Create a safe place for people to speak up.  Eric talked about decision making.  When you are making a decision, you may know what the decision already is, you may know what the right thing to do is, but make sure everybody gets heard.  People will fall in line with the decision much better, even if it doesn't go their way if they have been actually listened to.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And you talked about censorship a moment ago, would you prefer to have censorship?  Well, in many places there is censorship like in China and, obviously, Google has come across and come to sort of its accommodation with China.</p><p>You said last year at a private event, Eric, that you predicted we'd see a \"bifurcation\" into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.  And you warned of the danger of leadership in that way from a Chinese government that values censorship.  But at the same time, and we've reported this a lot, Google was under heat for its own employees for Project Dragonfly, which is kind of a censored version of a search engine that would, you know, keep certain information away from the Chinese authorities.  Where do you come down on that?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, let's talk about China and the internet for a second.  The Chinese internet companies are faster growing and higher valuation than what you call big tech here in the West.  They are operating and growing in a separate ecosystem.  They have some links outside of China.  But China itself is so large, as a business, and they are so successful that they are primarily domestically focused.</p><p>If you talk to the founders of those companies, their primary concern is the government because the government could, for example, arbitrarily decide to not allow them to do a product or so forth and so on.  All of them are subject to the very aggressive laws with respect to surveillance, loss of privacy and so forth.</p><p>My concern is that that model not become the internet and my concern is that the internet not split in that way.  I think it's very important that Western values of openness and communications and so forth, which we took for granted, are globally available.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- I mean, taking what you've just said, are you pleased then that the complaints by Google employees about this, which were verbalized, have apparently put operation Dragonfly either on hold or have ditched it altogether?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, again, not involved with those decisions.  So, I don't know the specifics of the decision.  What I can tell you is our culture encourages this kind of expression of interest.  The company has to make the decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- go ahead.</p><p>EAGLE:  I'm pleased that employees felt it was okay to speak up.  Whether or not they influenced something or not, they felt empowered, they didn't -- they felt something that wasn't going right at the company or at least in their opinion it wasn't, and they felt they could speak up about it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And in fact, the current CEO, Sundar Pichai, says it was merely an internal project.  He's denied any plans to launch one in China and says the project has since been dropped.  Bill Campbell, would he have agreed with that?  Are you pleased that it's been dropped, whatever was going on?</p><p>EAGLE:  Again, I'm pleased people felt empowered to talk up about it, speak up about it and that they were listened to, regardless of the issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What is the biggest takeaway in terms of management between leaders and employees that we -- that you hope you take from this book?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  The basic principle is bring humanity back into the workplace.  Respect, listening, caring about people, helping them achieve their objectives.  This is what Bill was all about.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that could be an exponential game changer because still, to this day, the little people are still nervous about their jobs should they feel that they're part of the project and feel empowered and then get themselves slapped around.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, and the book is called \"Trillion Dollar Coach\" because Bill was both Steve Jobs' coach --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  -- as well as my coach, and the sum of that is more than a trillion dollars of shareholder value.  He's by far the most successful coach in the world.  And at Google, and I suspect at Apple, you would never be able refer to our employees as little people, right?  Our model --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm talking about on the totem pole.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I'm -- our model is huge empowerment to our individual employees, which I'm very proud of.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What did you get from him, from Bill?  I know he was your coach.  And also, wasn't Steve Jobs a little bit sort of nervous about Bill coaching all the competitors as well?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, what's interesting about Bill is he managed to actually coach not just Apple and Google but many other companies in the Valley.  And he managed to do this because he was not involved in the product decisions.  He let the product decisions, which often were very complicated and different, stay separate.  He coached them, people, as individuals.</p><p>And somehow in the middle of all of the conflict between Apple and Google, he managed to do it and did it fairly to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>EAGLE:  And he built incredible trust, again, by listening, by being loyal, by being, you know, very careful with keeping secrets and he just built tremendous trust.  So, he could work with many different players.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Excellent.  Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  OK.  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The book is the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Thank you.</p><p>EAGLE:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now, we're going to take a cue from Shakespeare and his eternally timely, \"King Lear.\"  It too is all about power, a team of rivals and a big breakup of his kingdom no less.</p><p>Lear's decent into madness makes him one of the most challenging characters to grapple with on stage.  The latest actor taking up the gauntlet is Glenda Jackson.  At 83 years old, she's showing no signs of slowing down as she throws herself into eight shows a week on Broadway.</p><p>Fierce, funny and frank, it's a delight to welcome her back to this program between, of course, shows.  There you are in New York.</p><p>Welcome back, Glenda Jackson.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is exhaust, right?  I mean, it's very physical and all-encompassing performance.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, it is and it isn't.  I mean, I'm used to eight shows a week.  I mean, that was the work toll, that it was practiced in England when I began and still is.  But there is enormous energy in the play itself.  And if you can touch into that energy, and we do as a company, then, really, I mean, I sometimes feel more energized when it's -- when we've done it than when I started.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I wonder whether -- because you've also said that you think, you know, Shakespeare is perhaps one of the most, if not the most contemporary of playwrights.  And given all --</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, he is.  Undoubtedly.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  And we've just been talking about leadership --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- and power and corruption and breakup and ethics.  Where does he fit in for you?  Why do you call him still so contemporary?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, because he essentially only ever writes about us, about human beings.  And human nature is immutable.  Yes, we can and we do when we're still trying to improve the human condition.  But we, as human beings, don't change that much.  And there are tropes in the play that are absolutely reflected in the world as we know it today.</p><p>When I was particularly interested hearing the previous piece about power and leadership because Lear says in the play that he was flattered like a dog as the king.  People said to him aye and no to everything he said.  And the line is, \"Aye and no, too, is no good divinity.\"  And so, that is something that is still prevalent now.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, continuing that theme, this particular production of \"King Lear\" takes place, essentially in a single kind of gilded room.  And --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- you know, it then turns into a bit of a ruin in the second part.  But nonetheless, as you can imagine, given the times we're living in, some of the theater critics have said, \"Well, that room, that sort of -- that room must be Trumpian.  It must be the Trump tower conference room.\"  I mean, do you ever think about that?  Is there any kind of truth to that at all?</p><p>JACKSON:  I think there may have been something there in the background but certainly, Lear is not that kind of person.  I mean, the point about Lear is that he's a man who no one has ever said no to in his entire life.  He was born to that position of power.  He's, obviously, conducted it well.  He says he's handing it over to younger strength than his because he wants to have a peaceful retirement, ideally with his youngest, most favorite daughter in probably the most favorite place in this kingdom.  And it doesn't happen like that.</p><p>And so, what he has known all his life begins in the most terrible way to fracture, to fall apart, to finish.  But his power is never something that he's had to question or has been questioned until this critical moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, we're going to be playing now a little clip because it has been filmed.  And we've been talking about ethics.  And he's now losing his faculties, but he's got one sort of clear moment and here it is.  Here's you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are.  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm.  How shall your houseless heads, your own [phonetic], your looped and windowed raggedness, defend me from seasons such as this.  Aaah!  I have ta-en to little care of this.  Take physic pomp.  Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, that last line essentially says it all, \"Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.\"  Talk to me a little bit about that.</p><p>JACKSON:  It resonates particularly with me because when I was first elected a Member of Parliament, I think virtually every shop doorway in London and possibly in every metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, was the bedroom, living room and bathroom of some homeless person.  There had been major, major changes made in our social housing structures by the Then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed tenants to buy their properties usually at way below market prices.</p><p>And there was no recompense in replacing those -- that social housing foundation with new social housing.  And although the number of people who were homeless in my country went down, we are now seeing those numbers going up.  And certainly, here in New York, we see people on the streets every night.</p><p>And it is that, for him, for -- certainly for Lear, he makes that connection.  And I'm truly certain it is the first time in his life.  I'm pretty certain he thought all the time before then, but no word, if these people don't have anywhere to live it's because they're too idle to work.  You would find that opinion being replicated even now.</p><p>It suddenly strikes home to him because he suddenly, in the strange kind of way, realizes that he has no home.  He has nowhere to live.  And it's that acknowledgment that when he had the power to do something, essentially, you prevent that situation, he ducked out of it.  He wasn't aware of it, actually.  I think that is a moment of genuine shame for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really interesting because it's sort of builds on that theme, your -- King Lear's good friend, the Earl of Gloucester, who is also brought down by a disloyal child, he also finds himself, at one point, being confronted by a poor mentally ill man in the streets, and he gives him some money in the account (ph) and he says, \"So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.\"  I mean, you know, contemporarily, that would be redistribution of wealth.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely, it would, yes.  And look how hard that is, and becoming harder, it would seem.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it is incredible that those themes, I mean, as you say, they are so contemporary and so eternal.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Look, we make a big deal, I don't know why, about saying you're 83 years old and you're still doing this.  However, I think one of the reasons is the admiration that you still have so much gusto and so much, you know, spark on stage and get such great reviews and pulling in such audiences.  But also, I wonder whether Lear has to be played in your later years, in a later year.</p><p>And I just want you to think about that while I play something -- I hate to name drop, but I did interview Sir Ian McKellen and he played it on stage in London and talked about this connection between age and Lear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN MCKELLEN, ACTOR:  Well, there was a great actor in my youth, Ralph Richardson, a film star and stage star, who said in his typical wry, witty way, you get out of bed, it's a beautiful day.  The birds are tweeting, the sun is in the sky.  Your wife is being nice to you.  Nothing could go wrong.  And then, oh, you finally got your foot caught in a Lear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's kind of sweet they way he says it, but just this sort of inevitability, if you have the talent to play this in your -- in your -- in your later years, did you feel caught in a lear?</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTOR:  No, because the I don't -- Lear doesn't regard himself as being old.  I mean, he only acknowledges his age right at the end of the play and the part itself, actually, it demands energy.  I mean, it's not an old man's part in what was the kind of, oh I don't know, I mean, we're so hypocritical aren't we, as people, about age?</p><p>I mean, I remember when state pension age in my country was 65 and you expected suddenly, the day after you were 65 to have lost all the powers of understanding, not be able to walk, I mean, it's just ridiculous you know.</p><p>I mean, my birthday was last week.  I think I'm exactly the same the day after my birthday than I was before, but this thing about age is something -- I mean, you allow it to work into energy.</p><p>I -- one of the things I treasure most in my life is that by the accident of my birth, I was born in what we used to call the working classes, we're now called blue collar, I -- it was very simple for that class.  If you didn't work, you didn't eat.  And so, I have a very, very strong work ethic and I bless -- I bless my family for giving me that inheritance because it's been of immense value to me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And it's great actually, I just want to also -- there is so much ageism in society and sexism in society and here you are a woman of a certain age, and by the way happy birthday, not just playing this part, but also playing it as a woman.</p><p>And I think you were the -- well, one of the first women.  I think Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in, obviously, in the last century, but nonetheless, what you do make of that?  Did you ever get any misogynistic backlash?</p><p>JACKSON:  None whatever.  I mean, it is very, very rare.  I can't think anyone who's actually seen the play with me in it has raised that issue at all.  I mean, it may be -- we did have a gender bender battle in England and that has been triumphantly won by the group of actresses who created a company and kicked off that battle playing all the Shakespearean histories, all women casts, I think that battle, in the sense, has been won.</p><p>One of the touching things that was said to me -- no one has really, because I don't play it as a woman in that sense.  I mean one of the benefits of my being a member of</p><p>Parliament was that I visited old people's homes, day centers, places that helped people with disabilities and things of that nature, and we are, as a race, a breed, whatever you like to call us, living longer and longer and one of the fascinating things that I saw was that as we do get older, there's absolute boundaries that define our gender begin to crack, they begin to fray.</p><p>I mean we are taught, are we not, to be boys or girls.  Babies, when they're born, they don't know what their gender is and as we get older they begin to be filtrated by something else and that's very useful.</p><p>But one of the audience members who waited outside the theater one night said to me, I've seen this play many, many times and it's the first time I've seen an aspect of Lear that could have a maternal quality.  I don't play that maternal quality, but it is, undoubtedly, in there.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  That's is such -- that is really impressive.</p><p>JACKSON:  . brilliant Mr. Shakespeare, isn't it?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is.</p><p>JACKSON:  . just fascinating.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes, that really is.  And we had the opportunity to talk to Kate Pakenham who was head of the Donmar Warehouse, who did that trilogy, of course, as you said, there's Julius Caesar and two others, all women casts and it was amazing.  But she did say, because perhaps she was the first there was quite a lot of backlash here in Britain.</p><p>And we've also explore a lot on this show about work and sort of useful contribution to society, even beyond the retiring age.  So, I think you're absolutely right, these issues are happening.</p><p>But I want to play another clip from something you did much, much earlier.  Essentially it's -- it's -- I mean, it's got a long, long title, but it's the -- the -- the movie \"Marat/Sade\" and we're going to take a clip of your performance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Why are they housing (ph)?  What are they dragging through the streets?  They carry stakes, but what's impaled on those stakes?  What do they have?  What are they dancing for?  Why are they wrapped with laughter?  Why do the children scream?  What are those heaps they fight over?  Those heaps with eyes and mouths?  What kind of town is this?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You do -- you do mad very well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, I'll say thank you, even though I have my doubts, but thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, but it is interesting that -- I mean there's that much earlier in your career, there's this we show, two clips where you're really showing the frailties, the decent into madness, mental illness.  I mean, how do you -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, what I was going to say is, both of those examples where set in times.  I mean, certainly, the \"Marat/Sade\" was set in a specific time.  Shakespeare wrote his play in a specific time where the use of medicine was not there as a calming influence on people were having serious mental health problems and I think that is reflection.  So it's -- I mean, I think one of the areas which is very different today is that increase of medicinal calming.  I mean, I use that word, I mean it's the wrong word, but you know what I mean.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I do.  I do know what you mean, and very briefly, we've only got about a minute left.  You said that, in a recent radio interview, you said you think the inside me is about 15-years-old.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.  That's true, I do.  It's the envelop which carries our inside us that is increasingly disobedient.  Fingers don't do what you tell them to do, knees don't bend when you want them to do and the other amazing thing about reaching the age that I have is I -- I'm suddenly blinding aware of how little I know and how much there is that I would like to know.  So, I have a bit more time and can perhaps can close up those areas of total ignorance.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And what would be your next dream role, what happens after \"Lear\" for you?</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, look, I mean I remember all those years when there was no work available and one was just desperate for it.  So, anything that comes through the front door that is something is welcome.  I've always felt, when a job finishes, that I'm never going to be employed again.  Let's hope that I can be wrong.  That's that one of the things that I hope I learn.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm sure you are wrong.  Glenda Jackson, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now we turn to a new kid on the block, a teenage filmmaker just starting out, but already making waves.  He's 19-year-old Phillip Youmans.  His first feature, \"Burning Cane\" snapped up three awards at this year's Tribecca Film Festival.  The film is set in rural Louisiana and it tells a story of a deeply religious woman and her struggle to reconcile her faith with the love that she holds for her alcoholic son and a troubled preacher.</p><p>Phillip Youmans has now made history as the youngest director to feature in the festival and the first African-American to win the top prize.  And our Alicia Menendez spoke to him about the story behind his amazing story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Phillip, thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on your recent honor.</p><p>PHILLIP YOUMAN, FILMMAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Tell me what this film \"Burning Cane\" is about?</p><p>YOUMAN:  So, \"Burning Cane\" is about Helen Wayne (ph) a mother living in rural Louisiana.  Her son, Daniel and his son Jeremiah and also her pastor, Reverend Tillman (ph) and their relationships with each other, their relationships with their religion and their community and how their environment and their home effects really every aspect in the fabric of their lives.  It's about how religion, it sort of governs their community.  It's about the cyclical nature of destructive behavior and how vices are passed down in lineage very often.</p><p>And it's also about the dangers of enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion and then taking religious doctrine (ph) literally.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What is the meaning behind the title of the film, \"Burning Cane?\"</p><p>YOUMAN:  Burning cane is a part of harvesting cane, but -- and it's a part of the culture and the fabric of the entire process in the community.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Sugar cane?</p><p>YOUMAN:  Sugar cane.  But, it also releases toxins that are very negative for people's health.  And so, I think there's just an interesting sort of a dichotomy there, in that it is such an important part of their economy about -- it's -- and sugar cane in that -- in that -- in that industry is an important part of the culture and the fabric of that area, but it is also detrimental to their health in terms of the toxins that are released in the air because of it.</p><p>So, and I feel like that sort of touches on the sort -- the multi-dimensionality of all the characters that kind of populate the film.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You finished this film up during your senior year of high school, 17-years-old.  Tell me about the process of making this film.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  So it started when I was 16.  In the December of my junior year of high school I wrote this short script called \"The Glory\", and then I wanted to make that short, but I stepped away to make another short.  And then after that, my instructor at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts named Isaac Webb told me that he thought that the film had feature length potential because of the fact that it was so grounded in character, that it seemed like it could be something that could be made feasibly.  And so, I just because like obsessed with that idea.  And then in the ensuing weeks and months I was just churning out drafts of the feature length script, going through script revisions, meeting actors all the while raising money and casting.</p><p>And then so in that summer before my senior year, we went into production and shot the bulk of principal photography and then shot Wendell's piece in that August, and then the rest of senior year was spent in post production.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  For someone who doesn't go to an elite school like the one that you went to, how do you make a film like this?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think at my age when we made this film, I relied so much on the fact that the artists that were my friends and a lot of my friends who weren't artists were just really behind my mission and my drive.  And when you can't pay people industry rate, especially when we were that young, you have to rely on people wanting to work for you regardless or wanting to work with you because they believe in your and they believe in the project.  And for me in that case, those are my friends.  So I've actually been telling people recently that I feel like if you're as young as I was making a film, I think you really do have to kind of rely on your friends and your community in a way to ban together and help you figure out some of those resource and some of those jobs.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said, \"I think now is probably the best time for \"Burning Cane\" to come out.  Why now?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, there is - there is - there is two parts to that.  I think that just - I think it's time for us to kind of take an objective look just at religion and its role in our community and how it plays into our advancement as a community.  And I also think in terms of making this, you know, in more like applicable sense I had to make the film then and now because of the fact that there was such a community around me that there was no other time that I was going to be able to rely on people's good will quite like I could then because the moment you turn 18, then you're an adult and people expect and entirely different thing, you know?</p><p>So when I was 18, we were already in post production, but when I was 17 I think we kind of - we were aware of the fact that people thought that we were just a student production and in that they were willing to give so much because they thought they were just helping out some kids.  And we were, you know, young, but we always envisioned this going farther than just, you know, a student project.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  There's a clip I want to watch.  It comes very early in the film, and it is Wendell Pierce giving his first sermon that we see in the film.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WENDELL PIERCE:  Now however it says he has died, he has learned that is not to be true.  That's not true.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don't mean nothing if you're going to lose your soul.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  He knows that's not to be true because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn't get him across Jordan into heaven.  No toys gets you into heaven.  It's the friendships that you have.  It's the kindness that you do.  Did you clothe me when I was naked?  Did you give me housing when I had no place to live?  Did you feed me when I was hungry?  Did you drink - give me water to drink when I was thirsty?  He who dies with the most toys wins.  What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Talk to me about the dichotomy of cutting between this sermon and then this man reckoning with his won demons?</p><p>YOUMANS:  There's some truth to what Tillman says in that sermon in that he believes that friendships and personal relationships are more valuable than material possessions, and I think most of us can kind of agree with that.  And I just kind of wanted to show the fact that there can be some truth that comes from this man and he can also still be broken.  He can still be a beacon for people that may oral status (ph) that pastors have but still be grappling with all those same demons on his own.  And it just brings about the question of whether or not we should be following anybody who can't really practice what they preach, but we should - should we even expect anyone to be able to do that?  That's a whole other question, you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did you convince Wendell Pierce to be apart of this film?</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, I - so in the - in the - on the months leading up to preproduction - well, in the months leading up to production actually, I was working at Morning Call Coffee Stand in City Park and I was waiting on a woman named Lula Elzy who's also an alumni of the same high school that Wendell and I went to - the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.  And I went up to Ms. Elzy and I was waiting on her table.  And she asked me about what I wanted to do, what school I went to.  And then I was talking to her about some of the roles in the project.  I told her that we had casted pretty much every role except this preacher, and I was just kind of explaining, you know, the preacher's motivations, where he was in this life.</p><p>And she said, \"what do you think of Wendell Pierce playing the role?\"  And of course I like freaked out, you know, because is Wendell is so - is big in our community not only because he's a brilliant actor, but because of - because of the work that he's done in Pontchartrain Park where he grew up, you know, and sort of helping stop all the gentrification that was coming through that area.  And then she texted him right in that moment and he responded to her quickly.  I think she said like, \"there's a (noka) student who's shooting a feature film this summer.</p><p>He's interested in seeing you play this role.\"  And he was like, \"OK, give him my email.\"  And so, I got his email and after that it was really just a back and forth with the script trying to make dates work, you know, looping him into all script revisions and - but Wendell coming in, it helped expand the community because initially the film was so much more centered on Daniel and Helen's relationship as a mother and son.  What Wendell came in and allowed is to kind of build this entire portrait as a community and show - and show how Helen's religion and the people that she associates with her religion, how they directly affect her actions with her loved ones and her family.  So it's just - it allowed the entire story, the entire community of Laurel Valley to be flushed out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did working with Wendell change you as a director?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think before working with Wendell or even before \"Burning Cane\" I had - I had kind of a messed up idea about what directing was.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What did you think it was?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I thought it was so much more, you know, commanding, so much more - so much more authoritarian than it really is and than it really should be.  It's so much more about the conversations that you have and sometimes maybe even the conversations that you have before you even show up to set, you know?  And I think what working with Wendell and Kaia and Dominique kind of taught me is that they're brilliant actors and you have to give brilliant actors the space to create alongside you.  It was just a - it was just a back and forth, you know, dialogue, and I mean, he made all the great choices, so it's - yes, it worked out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  He's not the only character in the film that struggles with addiction.  Let's take a look at another clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The main character, this is her son dancing around with his son, passes the little boy a bottle.  Talk to me about addiction.</p><p>YOUMANS:  So addiction runs through my family.  Alcoholism is probably the most prevalent example of that, and before I made \"Burning Cane\" actually it was when I was 17 in junior year I kind of had a little spout of alcoholism myself because I was always able to grow a beard pretty easily.  And so, I would go up to - go up to like discount stores in the city (inaudible) and get alcohol because they didn't ID me because I looked older.  But I was really kind of self medicating because I was at a particularly low point then.  I was insecure, jealous, and it really kind of sabotaging the relationship I was in.  And then it wasn't making things any better when the girl that I was dating at the time she was also dealing with some sort of alcoholism with her own family and her own father, you know?</p><p>So it was just - there was kind of cycle in that and I recognize that it was self medicating.  And my mother caught me actually a few times.  That why she told me to shave the beard.  After that, you know, as stopped drinking as much.  You know, I stayed away from hard liquor.  And so, I just kind of - I had my own personal experiences with some of the jealously and insecurity and alcoholism that Daniel kind of finds himself with.  All be it, Daniel's is much more magnified</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>And has a much, much harsher context in terms of him being an adult and having to care for his child and all of that.  But what I wanted to really touch on with Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship more than anything in that sort of sphere of alcoholism is just the fact that things can get passed on so easily.</p><p>That's another thing that's sort of cyclical, in the cyclical nature of vices and how they're passed on from generation to generation.  And it's -- that's something that present in the movie not only in alcoholism but also in smoking.</p><p>When it's routine, when it's normalized, it's so easy to let that become a part of your routine and I definitely wanted to touch on that with \"Burning Cane\" and Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The mother Helen was played by Karen Kaia Livers, one of the more complex and dynamic characters in this film.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAREN KAIA LIVERS, ACTRESS:  It was Mr. (inaudible) son Tyde (ph) who helped me to get up.  And by the grace of God, I could walk away.  I was scared I was going to have to be in a wheelchair.  But you know, with the help of the Lord, I'll be fine and I'll survive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's great, mom.  I'm glad to see that you're doing OK.</p><p>LIVERS:  Eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You said Wendell is our lead male character, but the story revolves around Helen and her decisions, her experiences define \"Burning Cane.\"  How so?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, Helen is a character in \"Burning Cane\" that has the major dramatic question that really has the major decision to make.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Which is how does she proceed with knowing the man that her son has become.  And how does she feel as a mother, is there any guilt that she feels for how he's turned out.  And it's also how does she respond, what action does she take to what he's done.  And with--</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is not just his grappling with his alcohol addiction--</p><p>YOUMANS:  No, no, no.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  -- but also with domestic violence.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Yes, yes.  And what I wanted to speak on especially with Helen is that there is a danger in enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion.</p><p>And that by the end of the film, she takes  Tillman's words and his guidance literally and in that, in that very fundamentalist interpretation of what she's saying -- what he says she takes action from that.  But her major question is how does she help the people and the men in her life really that she loves, a pasture, her grandson and her son Daniel.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said my artistic identity is defined by humanizing more than it is by my blackness.  What does that mean?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, I am -- I want to tell honest nuance black stories.  There's an (inaudible) and that is always going to be a part of my work.  But I think above all that, if not even above all of that but in kind of in tandem with that is showcasing the duality and the nuance of our experience.</p><p>But I think there's something important about us being able to as black people be able to tell our stories and be able to show ourselves in that (inaudible) light.  But I think it has to be told from a black perspective to make sure that the humanizing element is still there.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Phillip, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that is a lot of talent packed in to that young man.  And we want to end our program with a tribute to two of Hollywood's grand (inaudible) who have passed on this weekend.</p><p>First, Peggy Lipton, age 72 whose work in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks endeared her to generations.  And whose daughter with Quincy Jones Rashida Jones proves that the apple does not fall too far from the tree.</p><p>And at 97 years old, Doris Day has passed as well.  Her star turns in \"Pillow Talk,\" \"Calamity Jane\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" among many. Many others made the girl next door a Hollywood icon.  Thanks for watching tonight and goodbye from London.  And as Doris Day herself might've said, Que sera, sera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DORIS DAY:  Que sera, sera.  Whatever will be, will be.  The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera.  What will be, will be.  Second verse, when I was just a child--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- in school, I asked my teacher what should I try.</p><p>[13:55:55]  DAY:  Catch</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should I paint pictures?

So, should giant tech companies be broken up now to protect the common good?  I'm joined by Google's former CE, Eric Schmidt, and one of its current directors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTRESS, \"KING LEAR\":  Expose yourself to fear.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Power and politics in the court of \"King Lear\".  Legendary actress, Glenda Jackson, has been taking Broadway by storm, gender bending Shakespeare's tragic hero at 83.</p><p>Then, the new kid on the block, 19-year-old director, Phillip Youmans, makes history at the Tribeca Film Festival and sits down with our Alicia Menendez to tell his amazing story.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>So, has big tech finally just gotten too big and too powerful?  As Silicon Valley dives ever deeper and deeper into our lives, there are rising calls for oversight.  When it comes to regulation, though, Europe is leading the United States.  And the summit in Paris this week with tech and world leaders is trying to get to grips with the idea of all-powerful monopolies, invasion of privacy and democracy, the spread of extremism and violence.</p><p>The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is coming to co-chair the meeting and rally support for the Christchurch call, that's a pledge names for the massacres there when a White nationalist mowed down 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques and live streamed it on Facebook.  And tomorrow, I'll sit down with the prime minister in Paris to hear about her hopes to eliminate extremism online.</p><p>Ardern's host and co-chair will, of course, be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and he has just met with Mark Zuckerberg, as the Facebook founder continues his worldwide efforts at damage control while rejecting one of his own co-founders calls for Facebook to finally be broken up.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, tech leaders claim they are best placed to self-regulate, and they reject government intervention.  I asked the former CEO and chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and Alan Eagle, who is company director, what it would take to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to online content.  They join me to discuss their new book, \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" about Bill Campbell, the football coach who became a guru in Silicon Valley because of his teachings on ethical leadership.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, welcome to the program.</p><p>Look, we are talking in a really heightened state of attention on the social giants, the big tech giants.  You know that President Macron of France is talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, also to the prime minister of New Zealand in the wake of this horror in Christchurch, which was, to an extent, aided and abetted and supported by violent extremist content online.</p><p>So, what do you think about the state of your big companies right now?  Is there room?  Is it time to make some dramatic changes in solutions?  First, since you were CEO.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER GOOGLE CEO AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  Well, I always worry about regulation, which is around the current problem and not fixing the real problem.  I think it's much better when the tech giants, as you call them, work on solving this themselves.  Each company is different.</p><p>In Google's case we worked really, really hard to find and detect evil things that violate our policies and take them down super quickly.  There's furthermore promise that A.I. will allow this to be detected automatically.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What about you?  I mean, they -- you are giants.  I mean, you've dominated the landscape ever since sort of, you know, this started.  What do you think?  Because everybody says, yes, you know, these companies should regulate themselves.  We don't want government, et cetera.  But the U.S. is playing catch up to Europe where there is regulation and to a growing clamor amongst people for some kind of more responsible attitude toward what's out there.</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  I can just tell you from what's going on day-to-day inside the company as a director on the sales team, people are working very hard every day to do the right thing.</p><p>As Eric was talking about, you know, in an open web, it's going to be a constant battle of people putting up bad things and we try to find them and bring them down as quickly as possible.  But the company really is trying very hard working very hard on these every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, I'm going to play a soundbite from Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential candidates.  And she along with Senator Elizabeth Warren are very clear about what they say they want to do, and that is sort of a breakup of the giant companies.  This is what she said recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have to recognize it for what it is, it is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.  And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, she is talking sense, right?  It's gone unregulated, and to a great degree, I mean, Google, Facebook, all the others, have not done enough, according to her and according to many people, to regulate themselves.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  She's also running for president.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  As is her competitor, Elizabeth Warren.  There's no basis in law to break up these companies in the U.S.  And fundamentally, the breakup would increase costs.  It's far, far better for the companies to try to figure out how to solve this problem.</p><p>The people inside these companies don't want this stuff to happen either.  The fact of the matter is that a very small percentage of humans do really bad things.  We need to get better at detecting these things and stopping it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What would you then say when you say there's no basis in law or we the companies should do it ourselves and not have government -- what then is a solution?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, as I said, the computer industry as a whole, and each of the companies, YouTube does a fantastic job of this, detect bad stuff automatically using various mathematical techniques in history and so forth.  And the things that are put up are taken down in a very few number of seconds.  That's probably the state of the art right now and it's getting better and better.</p><p>I don't know how, in a world where humans can upload over and over again things which are evil, how you can prevent that without having a censorship regime.  Do you really want to put in government censors on what people say?  I don't think so.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You describe it as censorship.  This is what Chris Hughes, I realize he's not a Google employee or founder, but he was one of the founders of Facebook and he's been getting a huge amount of attention because he's said it's time for Mark Zuckerberg's power to be reduced by breaking up Facebook.  And particularly, he's talked about readdressing the acquisitions that Facebook made of WhatsApp and Instagram.  This is what he just recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  We shouldn't need to just trust the private sector to do the right thing.  I mean, we don't do that with airlines, we don't do that with pharmaceutical companies, we don't do that with the financial industry, we don't do that with health care.  We say we want competition.  We understand that dynamic markets are a good thing, but we want to also ensure that there's a baseline level of protection.</p><p>And the fact we haven't gotten there with digital companies, I think is a testament to how quickly not just Facebook but Google, Amazon, Apple, all of them have grown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The big four giants.  And again, you know, you said there's no basis in law, but there is in -- there's precedent in the United States for breaking up some of these big companies.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Not on --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Antitrust.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Not under the current set of laws in the U.S.  If you follow Chris' arguments, he's fundamentally arguing for very slow rates of innovation.  He benefited from the fact that Facebook's entry into an open web allowed the creation of an enormous achievement, which was Facebook at the time.  He benefited personally from that.</p><p>Do you really want to slow that down by a factor of 10?  Look at the rate of innovation in health care and aviation and industries that he named.  I would prefer to have the innovation run forward and then when things happen, let's get together and figure out a way to solve them.  Let's figure out how to not prematurely regulate these industries.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I hear you keep saying that and realize you're saying that from your, you know, innovator, business perspective.  I understand that.  It's also a massively profit-making business, there's no doubt about it.  And Chris Hughes, to be fair, does not attack Mark Zuckerberg personally.  He says he even thinks that Mark Zuckerberg thinks that he's got too much power and that's just too much power in any democracy.</p><p>Your book, the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"  I mean, you lion eyes this wonderful man, Bill Campbell, who has been so front and center of the Silicon Valley, of the innovation, and also of the ethic.  I mean, the book really does focus on his ethic in business.</p><p>How does that fit in to where we are now?  I mean, even if you don't like the idea of regulation, because after all, Americans, you know, are unregulatable and we don't like censorship, and entrepreneurship is, you know, has to happen come what may.  But surely there is today a common good that does need the kind of ethics that your book focuses on to be involved.</p><p>EAGLE:  Well, Bill was a football coach, American football, before he became -- went into business.  For him it was all about the team and the good of the team.  And so, when he would be looking, we can't assume what he would say today if he were dealing with some of these issues, but what he could look at is, what is the team?  Who are the right people working on it, and are they the right people?  Are they coachable?  Are they people who learn as they go and are they focused on integrity and doing the right thing?</p><p>So, it isn't so much -- he wouldn't talk to us about what should you do, but he'd look at, what is the right team?  Is the right team looking at it and do they have the right ethics along with the other traits that (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I just wonder what you as people and as tech innovators vested in this company particularly think when you see a Christchurch where it was live streamed and only apparently 4,000 people saw it live but then it was replicated so many times.  All of Putin, et cetera, interfering in our laws or the violence against women and other stuff we see.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It's always a shock to discover that there's evil in the world.  But the evil was there before Google, Facebook --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it was never so exponentially distributed.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It was certainly present and that evil now use the latest tools.  That doesn't mean that the tools themselves are evil.  It means that the toolmakers have to figure out ways to make sure this stuff is not misused.</p><p>In the cases you're citing, it's probably possible to detect this kind of behavior algorithmically that is very quickly.  So, when something bad comes up, basically, not only stop it but prevent it from being replicated.  YouTube does this quite well.</p><p>YouTube had this problem over a decade.  And what would happen is, people who were insane or evil or what have you would keep uploading bad stuff, especially if it was pornographic.  And we developed ways to not only to detect it but also prevent it.</p><p>The solution to this is to make sure that the common space follows the guidelines of (INAUDIBLE).  None of the companies you named have guidelines which allow the kind of evil you're describing.  It's their job, our job, to police that.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.  I mean, obviously, none of you would allow that kind of stuff.  I mean, It's so awful.  But just as you said that the internet had to start policing pornography and terrorism as well.  I mean, when there's an ISIS thing, people try to take it down or you all try to take it down as quickly as possible.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, we're clear, all of this content is not okay with any of these companies.  There's no company saying, \"Hey, we want more of this.\"  They all want less of it.  Give us the time to build the systems that detect it but don't otherwise harm innovation and free speech.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, I guess it just always comes back to, particularly in the world that we're living in right now.  First of all, it's not just antitrust, it's the wholesale violation of privacy and in some cases, massive technological, you know, surveillance state that in some countries is being enabled by all of this.  But it just does go on.  I mean, it does, and it is hard for people now to accept that it's a big moneymaker for you all at their cost.  Given the fact that it's also massively helpful in so many parts of the endeavor.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, would you prefer these services all charge their actual rates and rather than be free?  Would you prefer that they have registered users, as you have in China, where all of a sudden, the government knows exactly what their use is?  There are real trade-offs here.</p><p>And while we focus on these exceptions, which are bad exceptions, let's not forget the good, right?  These are platforms which are broadly available.  There are multibillions of people using them.  They've brought enormous benefits of knowledge.  If you look at the developing world it has an access to information, access to health care.  The empowerment of new competitors and the empowerment of interview entrants.  Over and over and over again, the number of companies that have been abled by these technologies is extraordinary.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt about that.  However, there is absolutely -- the good news, would you prefer this or that?  Well, I belong to a profession that is regulated, you know.  And I'm a member of the press with the First Amendment right behind me constitutionally.  But nonetheless, there are things we cannot say or do in our profession.</p><p>So, let's get back to the \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" because he is really an interesting man.  And when he talks about leadership, which I actually think is fascinating, particularly in this world, what makes a great leader?  What -- is it about just winning?  Is it about subjugation and dominance?  And he -- you quote him or you write about him.  He says, \"You need to,\" according to a 1994 study, \"go beyond the traditional notion of managing that focuses on controlling, supervising, evaluating and rewarding/punishing to create a climate of communication, respect, feedback and trust.  All through coaching.\"</p><p>Tell me how that plays out then in your experience?  What did he teach you all, and how does that come into play in these positions of really huge leadership and power that you have?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, as you talked about it, these are incredibly stressful and important decisions.  And the question is, not what the decision should be.  Bill would teach who is taking the decision and how do you get the right people.</p><p>And he would often say the problem is you have the people who think they know the answer.  Let's go find the smartest people, get them and work on it really quickly.  Over and over again at Google, we found small groups of people who are incredibly expert, who had an idea to solve the problems that you named or others, and we relied on them.  The right thing happened.</p><p>What the coach told us was it's a coaching mechanism and it's a team sport, right?  Everyone is focused on the leader by name.  Everyone knows the famous leaders of these companies and the famous founders, but you forget there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are working with them to collectively make this happen.</p><p>This book is about coaching the whole team.  I would argue, by the way, that this is a new Silicon Valley export.  The notion of business coaching of the whole team.  And the reason is, think about it, in any sport, are there any teams that succeed without coaches?  Of course not.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, again, I find the idea of the pyramid, which we all live in a pyramid.  We hear at now Warner Media.  We have a boss and it filters down.  How do you get team members from -- you know, from the lowest up to the highest, to feel that they can safely and securely, as long as they're competent and good and do their job well and all the rest of it, either back up what you're doing or complain or even whistleblower to you, I'm not saying public, but come and talk to you about things that make them uneasy?  Because, you know, there's some issues with Google.  I mean, the 20,000 people walk out over the allegations of sexual harassment, 50 cities in November.</p><p>EAGLE:  I think that was Google culture working at its best.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EAGLE:  Because the answer to your question is to listen to people.  And you said the word safely, that's what you want.  Create a safe place for people to speak up.  Eric talked about decision making.  When you are making a decision, you may know what the decision already is, you may know what the right thing to do is, but make sure everybody gets heard.  People will fall in line with the decision much better, even if it doesn't go their way if they have been actually listened to.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And you talked about censorship a moment ago, would you prefer to have censorship?  Well, in many places there is censorship like in China and, obviously, Google has come across and come to sort of its accommodation with China.</p><p>You said last year at a private event, Eric, that you predicted we'd see a \"bifurcation\" into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.  And you warned of the danger of leadership in that way from a Chinese government that values censorship.  But at the same time, and we've reported this a lot, Google was under heat for its own employees for Project Dragonfly, which is kind of a censored version of a search engine that would, you know, keep certain information away from the Chinese authorities.  Where do you come down on that?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, let's talk about China and the internet for a second.  The Chinese internet companies are faster growing and higher valuation than what you call big tech here in the West.  They are operating and growing in a separate ecosystem.  They have some links outside of China.  But China itself is so large, as a business, and they are so successful that they are primarily domestically focused.</p><p>If you talk to the founders of those companies, their primary concern is the government because the government could, for example, arbitrarily decide to not allow them to do a product or so forth and so on.  All of them are subject to the very aggressive laws with respect to surveillance, loss of privacy and so forth.</p><p>My concern is that that model not become the internet and my concern is that the internet not split in that way.  I think it's very important that Western values of openness and communications and so forth, which we took for granted, are globally available.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- I mean, taking what you've just said, are you pleased then that the complaints by Google employees about this, which were verbalized, have apparently put operation Dragonfly either on hold or have ditched it altogether?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, again, not involved with those decisions.  So, I don't know the specifics of the decision.  What I can tell you is our culture encourages this kind of expression of interest.  The company has to make the decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- go ahead.</p><p>EAGLE:  I'm pleased that employees felt it was okay to speak up.  Whether or not they influenced something or not, they felt empowered, they didn't -- they felt something that wasn't going right at the company or at least in their opinion it wasn't, and they felt they could speak up about it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And in fact, the current CEO, Sundar Pichai, says it was merely an internal project.  He's denied any plans to launch one in China and says the project has since been dropped.  Bill Campbell, would he have agreed with that?  Are you pleased that it's been dropped, whatever was going on?</p><p>EAGLE:  Again, I'm pleased people felt empowered to talk up about it, speak up about it and that they were listened to, regardless of the issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What is the biggest takeaway in terms of management between leaders and employees that we -- that you hope you take from this book?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  The basic principle is bring humanity back into the workplace.  Respect, listening, caring about people, helping them achieve their objectives.  This is what Bill was all about.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that could be an exponential game changer because still, to this day, the little people are still nervous about their jobs should they feel that they're part of the project and feel empowered and then get themselves slapped around.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, and the book is called \"Trillion Dollar Coach\" because Bill was both Steve Jobs' coach --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  -- as well as my coach, and the sum of that is more than a trillion dollars of shareholder value.  He's by far the most successful coach in the world.  And at Google, and I suspect at Apple, you would never be able refer to our employees as little people, right?  Our model --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm talking about on the totem pole.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I'm -- our model is huge empowerment to our individual employees, which I'm very proud of.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What did you get from him, from Bill?  I know he was your coach.  And also, wasn't Steve Jobs a little bit sort of nervous about Bill coaching all the competitors as well?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, what's interesting about Bill is he managed to actually coach not just Apple and Google but many other companies in the Valley.  And he managed to do this because he was not involved in the product decisions.  He let the product decisions, which often were very complicated and different, stay separate.  He coached them, people, as individuals.</p><p>And somehow in the middle of all of the conflict between Apple and Google, he managed to do it and did it fairly to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>EAGLE:  And he built incredible trust, again, by listening, by being loyal, by being, you know, very careful with keeping secrets and he just built tremendous trust.  So, he could work with many different players.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Excellent.  Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  OK.  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The book is the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Thank you.</p><p>EAGLE:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now, we're going to take a cue from Shakespeare and his eternally timely, \"King Lear.\"  It too is all about power, a team of rivals and a big breakup of his kingdom no less.</p><p>Lear's decent into madness makes him one of the most challenging characters to grapple with on stage.  The latest actor taking up the gauntlet is Glenda Jackson.  At 83 years old, she's showing no signs of slowing down as she throws herself into eight shows a week on Broadway.</p><p>Fierce, funny and frank, it's a delight to welcome her back to this program between, of course, shows.  There you are in New York.</p><p>Welcome back, Glenda Jackson.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is exhaust, right?  I mean, it's very physical and all-encompassing performance.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, it is and it isn't.  I mean, I'm used to eight shows a week.  I mean, that was the work toll, that it was practiced in England when I began and still is.  But there is enormous energy in the play itself.  And if you can touch into that energy, and we do as a company, then, really, I mean, I sometimes feel more energized when it's -- when we've done it than when I started.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I wonder whether -- because you've also said that you think, you know, Shakespeare is perhaps one of the most, if not the most contemporary of playwrights.  And given all --</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, he is.  Undoubtedly.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  And we've just been talking about leadership --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- and power and corruption and breakup and ethics.  Where does he fit in for you?  Why do you call him still so contemporary?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, because he essentially only ever writes about us, about human beings.  And human nature is immutable.  Yes, we can and we do when we're still trying to improve the human condition.  But we, as human beings, don't change that much.  And there are tropes in the play that are absolutely reflected in the world as we know it today.</p><p>When I was particularly interested hearing the previous piece about power and leadership because Lear says in the play that he was flattered like a dog as the king.  People said to him aye and no to everything he said.  And the line is, \"Aye and no, too, is no good divinity.\"  And so, that is something that is still prevalent now.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, continuing that theme, this particular production of \"King Lear\" takes place, essentially in a single kind of gilded room.  And --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- you know, it then turns into a bit of a ruin in the second part.  But nonetheless, as you can imagine, given the times we're living in, some of the theater critics have said, \"Well, that room, that sort of -- that room must be Trumpian.  It must be the Trump tower conference room.\"  I mean, do you ever think about that?  Is there any kind of truth to that at all?</p><p>JACKSON:  I think there may have been something there in the background but certainly, Lear is not that kind of person.  I mean, the point about Lear is that he's a man who no one has ever said no to in his entire life.  He was born to that position of power.  He's, obviously, conducted it well.  He says he's handing it over to younger strength than his because he wants to have a peaceful retirement, ideally with his youngest, most favorite daughter in probably the most favorite place in this kingdom.  And it doesn't happen like that.</p><p>And so, what he has known all his life begins in the most terrible way to fracture, to fall apart, to finish.  But his power is never something that he's had to question or has been questioned until this critical moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, we're going to be playing now a little clip because it has been filmed.  And we've been talking about ethics.  And he's now losing his faculties, but he's got one sort of clear moment and here it is.  Here's you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are.  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm.  How shall your houseless heads, your own [phonetic], your looped and windowed raggedness, defend me from seasons such as this.  Aaah!  I have ta-en to little care of this.  Take physic pomp.  Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, that last line essentially says it all, \"Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.\"  Talk to me a little bit about that.</p><p>JACKSON:  It resonates particularly with me because when I was first elected a Member of Parliament, I think virtually every shop doorway in London and possibly in every metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, was the bedroom, living room and bathroom of some homeless person.  There had been major, major changes made in our social housing structures by the Then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed tenants to buy their properties usually at way below market prices.</p><p>And there was no recompense in replacing those -- that social housing foundation with new social housing.  And although the number of people who were homeless in my country went down, we are now seeing those numbers going up.  And certainly, here in New York, we see people on the streets every night.</p><p>And it is that, for him, for -- certainly for Lear, he makes that connection.  And I'm truly certain it is the first time in his life.  I'm pretty certain he thought all the time before then, but no word, if these people don't have anywhere to live it's because they're too idle to work.  You would find that opinion being replicated even now.</p><p>It suddenly strikes home to him because he suddenly, in the strange kind of way, realizes that he has no home.  He has nowhere to live.  And it's that acknowledgment that when he had the power to do something, essentially, you prevent that situation, he ducked out of it.  He wasn't aware of it, actually.  I think that is a moment of genuine shame for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really interesting because it's sort of builds on that theme, your -- King Lear's good friend, the Earl of Gloucester, who is also brought down by a disloyal child, he also finds himself, at one point, being confronted by a poor mentally ill man in the streets, and he gives him some money in the account (ph) and he says, \"So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.\"  I mean, you know, contemporarily, that would be redistribution of wealth.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely, it would, yes.  And look how hard that is, and becoming harder, it would seem.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it is incredible that those themes, I mean, as you say, they are so contemporary and so eternal.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Look, we make a big deal, I don't know why, about saying you're 83 years old and you're still doing this.  However, I think one of the reasons is the admiration that you still have so much gusto and so much, you know, spark on stage and get such great reviews and pulling in such audiences.  But also, I wonder whether Lear has to be played in your later years, in a later year.</p><p>And I just want you to think about that while I play something -- I hate to name drop, but I did interview Sir Ian McKellen and he played it on stage in London and talked about this connection between age and Lear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN MCKELLEN, ACTOR:  Well, there was a great actor in my youth, Ralph Richardson, a film star and stage star, who said in his typical wry, witty way, you get out of bed, it's a beautiful day.  The birds are tweeting, the sun is in the sky.  Your wife is being nice to you.  Nothing could go wrong.  And then, oh, you finally got your foot caught in a Lear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's kind of sweet they way he says it, but just this sort of inevitability, if you have the talent to play this in your -- in your -- in your later years, did you feel caught in a lear?</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTOR:  No, because the I don't -- Lear doesn't regard himself as being old.  I mean, he only acknowledges his age right at the end of the play and the part itself, actually, it demands energy.  I mean, it's not an old man's part in what was the kind of, oh I don't know, I mean, we're so hypocritical aren't we, as people, about age?</p><p>I mean, I remember when state pension age in my country was 65 and you expected suddenly, the day after you were 65 to have lost all the powers of understanding, not be able to walk, I mean, it's just ridiculous you know.</p><p>I mean, my birthday was last week.  I think I'm exactly the same the day after my birthday than I was before, but this thing about age is something -- I mean, you allow it to work into energy.</p><p>I -- one of the things I treasure most in my life is that by the accident of my birth, I was born in what we used to call the working classes, we're now called blue collar, I -- it was very simple for that class.  If you didn't work, you didn't eat.  And so, I have a very, very strong work ethic and I bless -- I bless my family for giving me that inheritance because it's been of immense value to me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And it's great actually, I just want to also -- there is so much ageism in society and sexism in society and here you are a woman of a certain age, and by the way happy birthday, not just playing this part, but also playing it as a woman.</p><p>And I think you were the -- well, one of the first women.  I think Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in, obviously, in the last century, but nonetheless, what you do make of that?  Did you ever get any misogynistic backlash?</p><p>JACKSON:  None whatever.  I mean, it is very, very rare.  I can't think anyone who's actually seen the play with me in it has raised that issue at all.  I mean, it may be -- we did have a gender bender battle in England and that has been triumphantly won by the group of actresses who created a company and kicked off that battle playing all the Shakespearean histories, all women casts, I think that battle, in the sense, has been won.</p><p>One of the touching things that was said to me -- no one has really, because I don't play it as a woman in that sense.  I mean one of the benefits of my being a member of</p><p>Parliament was that I visited old people's homes, day centers, places that helped people with disabilities and things of that nature, and we are, as a race, a breed, whatever you like to call us, living longer and longer and one of the fascinating things that I saw was that as we do get older, there's absolute boundaries that define our gender begin to crack, they begin to fray.</p><p>I mean we are taught, are we not, to be boys or girls.  Babies, when they're born, they don't know what their gender is and as we get older they begin to be filtrated by something else and that's very useful.</p><p>But one of the audience members who waited outside the theater one night said to me, I've seen this play many, many times and it's the first time I've seen an aspect of Lear that could have a maternal quality.  I don't play that maternal quality, but it is, undoubtedly, in there.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  That's is such -- that is really impressive.</p><p>JACKSON:  . brilliant Mr. Shakespeare, isn't it?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is.</p><p>JACKSON:  . just fascinating.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes, that really is.  And we had the opportunity to talk to Kate Pakenham who was head of the Donmar Warehouse, who did that trilogy, of course, as you said, there's Julius Caesar and two others, all women casts and it was amazing.  But she did say, because perhaps she was the first there was quite a lot of backlash here in Britain.</p><p>And we've also explore a lot on this show about work and sort of useful contribution to society, even beyond the retiring age.  So, I think you're absolutely right, these issues are happening.</p><p>But I want to play another clip from something you did much, much earlier.  Essentially it's -- it's -- I mean, it's got a long, long title, but it's the -- the -- the movie \"Marat/Sade\" and we're going to take a clip of your performance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Why are they housing (ph)?  What are they dragging through the streets?  They carry stakes, but what's impaled on those stakes?  What do they have?  What are they dancing for?  Why are they wrapped with laughter?  Why do the children scream?  What are those heaps they fight over?  Those heaps with eyes and mouths?  What kind of town is this?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You do -- you do mad very well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, I'll say thank you, even though I have my doubts, but thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, but it is interesting that -- I mean there's that much earlier in your career, there's this we show, two clips where you're really showing the frailties, the decent into madness, mental illness.  I mean, how do you -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, what I was going to say is, both of those examples where set in times.  I mean, certainly, the \"Marat/Sade\" was set in a specific time.  Shakespeare wrote his play in a specific time where the use of medicine was not there as a calming influence on people were having serious mental health problems and I think that is reflection.  So it's -- I mean, I think one of the areas which is very different today is that increase of medicinal calming.  I mean, I use that word, I mean it's the wrong word, but you know what I mean.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I do.  I do know what you mean, and very briefly, we've only got about a minute left.  You said that, in a recent radio interview, you said you think the inside me is about 15-years-old.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.  That's true, I do.  It's the envelop which carries our inside us that is increasingly disobedient.  Fingers don't do what you tell them to do, knees don't bend when you want them to do and the other amazing thing about reaching the age that I have is I -- I'm suddenly blinding aware of how little I know and how much there is that I would like to know.  So, I have a bit more time and can perhaps can close up those areas of total ignorance.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And what would be your next dream role, what happens after \"Lear\" for you?</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, look, I mean I remember all those years when there was no work available and one was just desperate for it.  So, anything that comes through the front door that is something is welcome.  I've always felt, when a job finishes, that I'm never going to be employed again.  Let's hope that I can be wrong.  That's that one of the things that I hope I learn.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm sure you are wrong.  Glenda Jackson, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now we turn to a new kid on the block, a teenage filmmaker just starting out, but already making waves.  He's 19-year-old Phillip Youmans.  His first feature, \"Burning Cane\" snapped up three awards at this year's Tribecca Film Festival.  The film is set in rural Louisiana and it tells a story of a deeply religious woman and her struggle to reconcile her faith with the love that she holds for her alcoholic son and a troubled preacher.</p><p>Phillip Youmans has now made history as the youngest director to feature in the festival and the first African-American to win the top prize.  And our Alicia Menendez spoke to him about the story behind his amazing story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Phillip, thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on your recent honor.</p><p>PHILLIP YOUMAN, FILMMAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Tell me what this film \"Burning Cane\" is about?</p><p>YOUMAN:  So, \"Burning Cane\" is about Helen Wayne (ph) a mother living in rural Louisiana.  Her son, Daniel and his son Jeremiah and also her pastor, Reverend Tillman (ph) and their relationships with each other, their relationships with their religion and their community and how their environment and their home effects really every aspect in the fabric of their lives.  It's about how religion, it sort of governs their community.  It's about the cyclical nature of destructive behavior and how vices are passed down in lineage very often.</p><p>And it's also about the dangers of enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion and then taking religious doctrine (ph) literally.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What is the meaning behind the title of the film, \"Burning Cane?\"</p><p>YOUMAN:  Burning cane is a part of harvesting cane, but -- and it's a part of the culture and the fabric of the entire process in the community.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Sugar cane?</p><p>YOUMAN:  Sugar cane.  But, it also releases toxins that are very negative for people's health.  And so, I think there's just an interesting sort of a dichotomy there, in that it is such an important part of their economy about -- it's -- and sugar cane in that -- in that -- in that industry is an important part of the culture and the fabric of that area, but it is also detrimental to their health in terms of the toxins that are released in the air because of it.</p><p>So, and I feel like that sort of touches on the sort -- the multi-dimensionality of all the characters that kind of populate the film.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You finished this film up during your senior year of high school, 17-years-old.  Tell me about the process of making this film.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  So it started when I was 16.  In the December of my junior year of high school I wrote this short script called \"The Glory\", and then I wanted to make that short, but I stepped away to make another short.  And then after that, my instructor at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts named Isaac Webb told me that he thought that the film had feature length potential because of the fact that it was so grounded in character, that it seemed like it could be something that could be made feasibly.  And so, I just because like obsessed with that idea.  And then in the ensuing weeks and months I was just churning out drafts of the feature length script, going through script revisions, meeting actors all the while raising money and casting.</p><p>And then so in that summer before my senior year, we went into production and shot the bulk of principal photography and then shot Wendell's piece in that August, and then the rest of senior year was spent in post production.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  For someone who doesn't go to an elite school like the one that you went to, how do you make a film like this?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think at my age when we made this film, I relied so much on the fact that the artists that were my friends and a lot of my friends who weren't artists were just really behind my mission and my drive.  And when you can't pay people industry rate, especially when we were that young, you have to rely on people wanting to work for you regardless or wanting to work with you because they believe in your and they believe in the project.  And for me in that case, those are my friends.  So I've actually been telling people recently that I feel like if you're as young as I was making a film, I think you really do have to kind of rely on your friends and your community in a way to ban together and help you figure out some of those resource and some of those jobs.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said, \"I think now is probably the best time for \"Burning Cane\" to come out.  Why now?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, there is - there is - there is two parts to that.  I think that just - I think it's time for us to kind of take an objective look just at religion and its role in our community and how it plays into our advancement as a community.  And I also think in terms of making this, you know, in more like applicable sense I had to make the film then and now because of the fact that there was such a community around me that there was no other time that I was going to be able to rely on people's good will quite like I could then because the moment you turn 18, then you're an adult and people expect and entirely different thing, you know?</p><p>So when I was 18, we were already in post production, but when I was 17 I think we kind of - we were aware of the fact that people thought that we were just a student production and in that they were willing to give so much because they thought they were just helping out some kids.  And we were, you know, young, but we always envisioned this going farther than just, you know, a student project.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  There's a clip I want to watch.  It comes very early in the film, and it is Wendell Pierce giving his first sermon that we see in the film.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WENDELL PIERCE:  Now however it says he has died, he has learned that is not to be true.  That's not true.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don't mean nothing if you're going to lose your soul.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  He knows that's not to be true because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn't get him across Jordan into heaven.  No toys gets you into heaven.  It's the friendships that you have.  It's the kindness that you do.  Did you clothe me when I was naked?  Did you give me housing when I had no place to live?  Did you feed me when I was hungry?  Did you drink - give me water to drink when I was thirsty?  He who dies with the most toys wins.  What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Talk to me about the dichotomy of cutting between this sermon and then this man reckoning with his won demons?</p><p>YOUMANS:  There's some truth to what Tillman says in that sermon in that he believes that friendships and personal relationships are more valuable than material possessions, and I think most of us can kind of agree with that.  And I just kind of wanted to show the fact that there can be some truth that comes from this man and he can also still be broken.  He can still be a beacon for people that may oral status (ph) that pastors have but still be grappling with all those same demons on his own.  And it just brings about the question of whether or not we should be following anybody who can't really practice what they preach, but we should - should we even expect anyone to be able to do that?  That's a whole other question, you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did you convince Wendell Pierce to be apart of this film?</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, I - so in the - in the - on the months leading up to preproduction - well, in the months leading up to production actually, I was working at Morning Call Coffee Stand in City Park and I was waiting on a woman named Lula Elzy who's also an alumni of the same high school that Wendell and I went to - the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.  And I went up to Ms. Elzy and I was waiting on her table.  And she asked me about what I wanted to do, what school I went to.  And then I was talking to her about some of the roles in the project.  I told her that we had casted pretty much every role except this preacher, and I was just kind of explaining, you know, the preacher's motivations, where he was in this life.</p><p>And she said, \"what do you think of Wendell Pierce playing the role?\"  And of course I like freaked out, you know, because is Wendell is so - is big in our community not only because he's a brilliant actor, but because of - because of the work that he's done in Pontchartrain Park where he grew up, you know, and sort of helping stop all the gentrification that was coming through that area.  And then she texted him right in that moment and he responded to her quickly.  I think she said like, \"there's a (noka) student who's shooting a feature film this summer.</p><p>He's interested in seeing you play this role.\"  And he was like, \"OK, give him my email.\"  And so, I got his email and after that it was really just a back and forth with the script trying to make dates work, you know, looping him into all script revisions and - but Wendell coming in, it helped expand the community because initially the film was so much more centered on Daniel and Helen's relationship as a mother and son.  What Wendell came in and allowed is to kind of build this entire portrait as a community and show - and show how Helen's religion and the people that she associates with her religion, how they directly affect her actions with her loved ones and her family.  So it's just - it allowed the entire story, the entire community of Laurel Valley to be flushed out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did working with Wendell change you as a director?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think before working with Wendell or even before \"Burning Cane\" I had - I had kind of a messed up idea about what directing was.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What did you think it was?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I thought it was so much more, you know, commanding, so much more - so much more authoritarian than it really is and than it really should be.  It's so much more about the conversations that you have and sometimes maybe even the conversations that you have before you even show up to set, you know?  And I think what working with Wendell and Kaia and Dominique kind of taught me is that they're brilliant actors and you have to give brilliant actors the space to create alongside you.  It was just a - it was just a back and forth, you know, dialogue, and I mean, he made all the great choices, so it's - yes, it worked out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  He's not the only character in the film that struggles with addiction.  Let's take a look at another clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The main character, this is her son dancing around with his son, passes the little boy a bottle.  Talk to me about addiction.</p><p>YOUMANS:  So addiction runs through my family.  Alcoholism is probably the most prevalent example of that, and before I made \"Burning Cane\" actually it was when I was 17 in junior year I kind of had a little spout of alcoholism myself because I was always able to grow a beard pretty easily.  And so, I would go up to - go up to like discount stores in the city (inaudible) and get alcohol because they didn't ID me because I looked older.  But I was really kind of self medicating because I was at a particularly low point then.  I was insecure, jealous, and it really kind of sabotaging the relationship I was in.  And then it wasn't making things any better when the girl that I was dating at the time she was also dealing with some sort of alcoholism with her own family and her own father, you know?</p><p>So it was just - there was kind of cycle in that and I recognize that it was self medicating.  And my mother caught me actually a few times.  That why she told me to shave the beard.  After that, you know, as stopped drinking as much.  You know, I stayed away from hard liquor.  And so, I just kind of - I had my own personal experiences with some of the jealously and insecurity and alcoholism that Daniel kind of finds himself with.  All be it, Daniel's is much more magnified</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>And has a much, much harsher context in terms of him being an adult and having to care for his child and all of that.  But what I wanted to really touch on with Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship more than anything in that sort of sphere of alcoholism is just the fact that things can get passed on so easily.</p><p>That's another thing that's sort of cyclical, in the cyclical nature of vices and how they're passed on from generation to generation.  And it's -- that's something that present in the movie not only in alcoholism but also in smoking.</p><p>When it's routine, when it's normalized, it's so easy to let that become a part of your routine and I definitely wanted to touch on that with \"Burning Cane\" and Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The mother Helen was played by Karen Kaia Livers, one of the more complex and dynamic characters in this film.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAREN KAIA LIVERS, ACTRESS:  It was Mr. (inaudible) son Tyde (ph) who helped me to get up.  And by the grace of God, I could walk away.  I was scared I was going to have to be in a wheelchair.  But you know, with the help of the Lord, I'll be fine and I'll survive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's great, mom.  I'm glad to see that you're doing OK.</p><p>LIVERS:  Eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You said Wendell is our lead male character, but the story revolves around Helen and her decisions, her experiences define \"Burning Cane.\"  How so?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, Helen is a character in \"Burning Cane\" that has the major dramatic question that really has the major decision to make.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Which is how does she proceed with knowing the man that her son has become.  And how does she feel as a mother, is there any guilt that she feels for how he's turned out.  And it's also how does she respond, what action does she take to what he's done.  And with--</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is not just his grappling with his alcohol addiction--</p><p>YOUMANS:  No, no, no.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  -- but also with domestic violence.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Yes, yes.  And what I wanted to speak on especially with Helen is that there is a danger in enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion.</p><p>And that by the end of the film, she takes  Tillman's words and his guidance literally and in that, in that very fundamentalist interpretation of what she's saying -- what he says she takes action from that.  But her major question is how does she help the people and the men in her life really that she loves, a pasture, her grandson and her son Daniel.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said my artistic identity is defined by humanizing more than it is by my blackness.  What does that mean?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, I am -- I want to tell honest nuance black stories.  There's an (inaudible) and that is always going to be a part of my work.  But I think above all that, if not even above all of that but in kind of in tandem with that is showcasing the duality and the nuance of our experience.</p><p>But I think there's something important about us being able to as black people be able to tell our stories and be able to show ourselves in that (inaudible) light.  But I think it has to be told from a black perspective to make sure that the humanizing element is still there.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Phillip, thank you so much.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that is a lot of talent packed in to that young man.  And we want to end our program with a tribute to two of Hollywood's grand (inaudible) who have passed on this weekend.</p><p>First, Peggy Lipton, age 72 whose work in The Mod Squad and Twin Peaks endeared her to generations.  And whose daughter with Quincy Jones Rashida Jones proves that the apple does not fall too far from the tree.</p><p>And at 97 years old, Doris Day has passed as well.  Her star turns in \"Pillow Talk,\" \"Calamity Jane\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" among many. Many others made the girl next door a Hollywood icon.  Thanks for watching tonight and goodbye from London.  And as Doris Day herself might've said, Que sera, sera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DORIS DAY:  Que sera, sera.  Whatever will be, will be.  The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera.  What will be, will be.  Second verse, when I was just a child--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- in school, I asked my teacher what should I try.</p><p>[13:55:55]  DAY:  Catch</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Should I paint pictures?

I'm joined by Google's former CE, Eric Schmidt, and one of its current directors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTRESS, \"KING LEAR\":  Expose yourself to fear.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Power and politics in the court of \"King Lear\".  Legendary actress, Glenda Jackson, has been taking Broadway by storm, gender bending Shakespeare's tragic hero at 83.</p><p>Then, the new kid on the block, 19-year-old director, Phillip Youmans, makes history at the Tribeca Film Festival and sits down with our Alicia Menendez to tell his amazing story.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>So, has big tech finally just gotten too big and too powerful?  As Silicon Valley dives ever deeper and deeper into our lives, there are rising calls for oversight.  When it comes to regulation, though, Europe is leading the United States.  And the summit in Paris this week with tech and world leaders is trying to get to grips with the idea of all-powerful monopolies, invasion of privacy and democracy, the spread of extremism and violence.</p><p>The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is coming to co-chair the meeting and rally support for the Christchurch call, that's a pledge names for the massacres there when a White nationalist mowed down 50 Muslim worshippers at two mosques and live streamed it on Facebook.  And tomorrow, I'll sit down with the prime minister in Paris to hear about her hopes to eliminate extremism online.</p><p>Ardern's host and co-chair will, of course, be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and he has just met with Mark Zuckerberg, as the Facebook founder continues his worldwide efforts at damage control while rejecting one of his own co-founders calls for Facebook to finally be broken up.</p><p>Now, unsurprisingly, tech leaders claim they are best placed to self-regulate, and they reject government intervention.  I asked the former CEO and chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, and Alan Eagle, who is company director, what it would take to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to online content.  They join me to discuss their new book, \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" about Bill Campbell, the football coach who became a guru in Silicon Valley because of his teachings on ethical leadership.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, welcome to the program.</p><p>Look, we are talking in a really heightened state of attention on the social giants, the big tech giants.  You know that President Macron of France is talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, also to the prime minister of New Zealand in the wake of this horror in Christchurch, which was, to an extent, aided and abetted and supported by violent extremist content online.</p><p>So, what do you think about the state of your big companies right now?  Is there room?  Is it time to make some dramatic changes in solutions?  First, since you were CEO.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER GOOGLE CEO AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  Well, I always worry about regulation, which is around the current problem and not fixing the real problem.  I think it's much better when the tech giants, as you call them, work on solving this themselves.  Each company is different.</p><p>In Google's case we worked really, really hard to find and detect evil things that violate our policies and take them down super quickly.  There's furthermore promise that A.I. will allow this to be detected automatically.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What about you?  I mean, they -- you are giants.  I mean, you've dominated the landscape ever since sort of, you know, this started.  What do you think?  Because everybody says, yes, you know, these companies should regulate themselves.  We don't want government, et cetera.  But the U.S. is playing catch up to Europe where there is regulation and to a growing clamor amongst people for some kind of more responsible attitude toward what's out there.</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR OF GOOGLE AND CO-AUTHOR, \"TRILLION DOLLAR COACH\":  I can just tell you from what's going on day-to-day inside the company as a director on the sales team, people are working very hard every day to do the right thing.</p><p>As Eric was talking about, you know, in an open web, it's going to be a constant battle of people putting up bad things and we try to find them and bring them down as quickly as possible.  But the company really is trying very hard working very hard on these every day.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, I'm going to play a soundbite from Senator Kamala Harris, one of the presidential candidates.  And she along with Senator Elizabeth Warren are very clear about what they say they want to do, and that is sort of a breakup of the giant companies.  This is what she said recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have to recognize it for what it is, it is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.  And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, she is talking sense, right?  It's gone unregulated, and to a great degree, I mean, Google, Facebook, all the others, have not done enough, according to her and according to many people, to regulate themselves.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  She's also running for president.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  As is her competitor, Elizabeth Warren.  There's no basis in law to break up these companies in the U.S.  And fundamentally, the breakup would increase costs.  It's far, far better for the companies to try to figure out how to solve this problem.</p><p>The people inside these companies don't want this stuff to happen either.  The fact of the matter is that a very small percentage of humans do really bad things.  We need to get better at detecting these things and stopping it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What would you then say when you say there's no basis in law or we the companies should do it ourselves and not have government -- what then is a solution?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, as I said, the computer industry as a whole, and each of the companies, YouTube does a fantastic job of this, detect bad stuff automatically using various mathematical techniques in history and so forth.  And the things that are put up are taken down in a very few number of seconds.  That's probably the state of the art right now and it's getting better and better.</p><p>I don't know how, in a world where humans can upload over and over again things which are evil, how you can prevent that without having a censorship regime.  Do you really want to put in government censors on what people say?  I don't think so.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You describe it as censorship.  This is what Chris Hughes, I realize he's not a Google employee or founder, but he was one of the founders of Facebook and he's been getting a huge amount of attention because he's said it's time for Mark Zuckerberg's power to be reduced by breaking up Facebook.  And particularly, he's talked about readdressing the acquisitions that Facebook made of WhatsApp and Instagram.  This is what he just recently.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  We shouldn't need to just trust the private sector to do the right thing.  I mean, we don't do that with airlines, we don't do that with pharmaceutical companies, we don't do that with the financial industry, we don't do that with health care.  We say we want competition.  We understand that dynamic markets are a good thing, but we want to also ensure that there's a baseline level of protection.</p><p>And the fact we haven't gotten there with digital companies, I think is a testament to how quickly not just Facebook but Google, Amazon, Apple, all of them have grown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The big four giants.  And again, you know, you said there's no basis in law, but there is in -- there's precedent in the United States for breaking up some of these big companies.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Not on --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Antitrust.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Not under the current set of laws in the U.S.  If you follow Chris' arguments, he's fundamentally arguing for very slow rates of innovation.  He benefited from the fact that Facebook's entry into an open web allowed the creation of an enormous achievement, which was Facebook at the time.  He benefited personally from that.</p><p>Do you really want to slow that down by a factor of 10?  Look at the rate of innovation in health care and aviation and industries that he named.  I would prefer to have the innovation run forward and then when things happen, let's get together and figure out a way to solve them.  Let's figure out how to not prematurely regulate these industries.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I hear you keep saying that and realize you're saying that from your, you know, innovator, business perspective.  I understand that.  It's also a massively profit-making business, there's no doubt about it.  And Chris Hughes, to be fair, does not attack Mark Zuckerberg personally.  He says he even thinks that Mark Zuckerberg thinks that he's got too much power and that's just too much power in any democracy.</p><p>Your book, the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"  I mean, you lion eyes this wonderful man, Bill Campbell, who has been so front and center of the Silicon Valley, of the innovation, and also of the ethic.  I mean, the book really does focus on his ethic in business.</p><p>How does that fit in to where we are now?  I mean, even if you don't like the idea of regulation, because after all, Americans, you know, are unregulatable and we don't like censorship, and entrepreneurship is, you know, has to happen come what may.  But surely there is today a common good that does need the kind of ethics that your book focuses on to be involved.</p><p>EAGLE:  Well, Bill was a football coach, American football, before he became -- went into business.  For him it was all about the team and the good of the team.  And so, when he would be looking, we can't assume what he would say today if he were dealing with some of these issues, but what he could look at is, what is the team?  Who are the right people working on it, and are they the right people?  Are they coachable?  Are they people who learn as they go and are they focused on integrity and doing the right thing?</p><p>So, it isn't so much -- he wouldn't talk to us about what should you do, but he'd look at, what is the right team?  Is the right team looking at it and do they have the right ethics along with the other traits that (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I just wonder what you as people and as tech innovators vested in this company particularly think when you see a Christchurch where it was live streamed and only apparently 4,000 people saw it live but then it was replicated so many times.  All of Putin, et cetera, interfering in our laws or the violence against women and other stuff we see.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It's always a shock to discover that there's evil in the world.  But the evil was there before Google, Facebook --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it was never so exponentially distributed.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  It was certainly present and that evil now use the latest tools.  That doesn't mean that the tools themselves are evil.  It means that the toolmakers have to figure out ways to make sure this stuff is not misused.</p><p>In the cases you're citing, it's probably possible to detect this kind of behavior algorithmically that is very quickly.  So, when something bad comes up, basically, not only stop it but prevent it from being replicated.  YouTube does this quite well.</p><p>YouTube had this problem over a decade.  And what would happen is, people who were insane or evil or what have you would keep uploading bad stuff, especially if it was pornographic.  And we developed ways to not only to detect it but also prevent it.</p><p>The solution to this is to make sure that the common space follows the guidelines of (INAUDIBLE).  None of the companies you named have guidelines which allow the kind of evil you're describing.  It's their job, our job, to police that.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Correct.  I mean, obviously, none of you would allow that kind of stuff.  I mean, It's so awful.  But just as you said that the internet had to start policing pornography and terrorism as well.  I mean, when there's an ISIS thing, people try to take it down or you all try to take it down as quickly as possible.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, we're clear, all of this content is not okay with any of these companies.  There's no company saying, \"Hey, we want more of this.\"  They all want less of it.  Give us the time to build the systems that detect it but don't otherwise harm innovation and free speech.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, I guess it just always comes back to, particularly in the world that we're living in right now.  First of all, it's not just antitrust, it's the wholesale violation of privacy and in some cases, massive technological, you know, surveillance state that in some countries is being enabled by all of this.  But it just does go on.  I mean, it does, and it is hard for people now to accept that it's a big moneymaker for you all at their cost.  Given the fact that it's also massively helpful in so many parts of the endeavor.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, would you prefer these services all charge their actual rates and rather than be free?  Would you prefer that they have registered users, as you have in China, where all of a sudden, the government knows exactly what their use is?  There are real trade-offs here.</p><p>And while we focus on these exceptions, which are bad exceptions, let's not forget the good, right?  These are platforms which are broadly available.  There are multibillions of people using them.  They've brought enormous benefits of knowledge.  If you look at the developing world it has an access to information, access to health care.  The empowerment of new competitors and the empowerment of interview entrants.  Over and over and over again, the number of companies that have been abled by these technologies is extraordinary.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt about that.  However, there is absolutely -- the good news, would you prefer this or that?  Well, I belong to a profession that is regulated, you know.  And I'm a member of the press with the First Amendment right behind me constitutionally.  But nonetheless, there are things we cannot say or do in our profession.</p><p>So, let's get back to the \"Trillion Dollar Coach,\" because he is really an interesting man.  And when he talks about leadership, which I actually think is fascinating, particularly in this world, what makes a great leader?  What -- is it about just winning?  Is it about subjugation and dominance?  And he -- you quote him or you write about him.  He says, \"You need to,\" according to a 1994 study, \"go beyond the traditional notion of managing that focuses on controlling, supervising, evaluating and rewarding/punishing to create a climate of communication, respect, feedback and trust.  All through coaching.\"</p><p>Tell me how that plays out then in your experience?  What did he teach you all, and how does that come into play in these positions of really huge leadership and power that you have?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, as you talked about it, these are incredibly stressful and important decisions.  And the question is, not what the decision should be.  Bill would teach who is taking the decision and how do you get the right people.</p><p>And he would often say the problem is you have the people who think they know the answer.  Let's go find the smartest people, get them and work on it really quickly.  Over and over again at Google, we found small groups of people who are incredibly expert, who had an idea to solve the problems that you named or others, and we relied on them.  The right thing happened.</p><p>What the coach told us was it's a coaching mechanism and it's a team sport, right?  Everyone is focused on the leader by name.  Everyone knows the famous leaders of these companies and the famous founders, but you forget there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are working with them to collectively make this happen.</p><p>This book is about coaching the whole team.  I would argue, by the way, that this is a new Silicon Valley export.  The notion of business coaching of the whole team.  And the reason is, think about it, in any sport, are there any teams that succeed without coaches?  Of course not.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, again, I find the idea of the pyramid, which we all live in a pyramid.  We hear at now Warner Media.  We have a boss and it filters down.  How do you get team members from -- you know, from the lowest up to the highest, to feel that they can safely and securely, as long as they're competent and good and do their job well and all the rest of it, either back up what you're doing or complain or even whistleblower to you, I'm not saying public, but come and talk to you about things that make them uneasy?  Because, you know, there's some issues with Google.  I mean, the 20,000 people walk out over the allegations of sexual harassment, 50 cities in November.</p><p>EAGLE:  I think that was Google culture working at its best.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EAGLE:  Because the answer to your question is to listen to people.  And you said the word safely, that's what you want.  Create a safe place for people to speak up.  Eric talked about decision making.  When you are making a decision, you may know what the decision already is, you may know what the right thing to do is, but make sure everybody gets heard.  People will fall in line with the decision much better, even if it doesn't go their way if they have been actually listened to.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And you talked about censorship a moment ago, would you prefer to have censorship?  Well, in many places there is censorship like in China and, obviously, Google has come across and come to sort of its accommodation with China.</p><p>You said last year at a private event, Eric, that you predicted we'd see a \"bifurcation\" into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.  And you warned of the danger of leadership in that way from a Chinese government that values censorship.  But at the same time, and we've reported this a lot, Google was under heat for its own employees for Project Dragonfly, which is kind of a censored version of a search engine that would, you know, keep certain information away from the Chinese authorities.  Where do you come down on that?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, let's talk about China and the internet for a second.  The Chinese internet companies are faster growing and higher valuation than what you call big tech here in the West.  They are operating and growing in a separate ecosystem.  They have some links outside of China.  But China itself is so large, as a business, and they are so successful that they are primarily domestically focused.</p><p>If you talk to the founders of those companies, their primary concern is the government because the government could, for example, arbitrarily decide to not allow them to do a product or so forth and so on.  All of them are subject to the very aggressive laws with respect to surveillance, loss of privacy and so forth.</p><p>My concern is that that model not become the internet and my concern is that the internet not split in that way.  I think it's very important that Western values of openness and communications and so forth, which we took for granted, are globally available.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- I mean, taking what you've just said, are you pleased then that the complaints by Google employees about this, which were verbalized, have apparently put operation Dragonfly either on hold or have ditched it altogether?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  So, again, not involved with those decisions.  So, I don't know the specifics of the decision.  What I can tell you is our culture encourages this kind of expression of interest.  The company has to make the decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So -- go ahead.</p><p>EAGLE:  I'm pleased that employees felt it was okay to speak up.  Whether or not they influenced something or not, they felt empowered, they didn't -- they felt something that wasn't going right at the company or at least in their opinion it wasn't, and they felt they could speak up about it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And in fact, the current CEO, Sundar Pichai, says it was merely an internal project.  He's denied any plans to launch one in China and says the project has since been dropped.  Bill Campbell, would he have agreed with that?  Are you pleased that it's been dropped, whatever was going on?</p><p>EAGLE:  Again, I'm pleased people felt empowered to talk up about it, speak up about it and that they were listened to, regardless of the issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What is the biggest takeaway in terms of management between leaders and employees that we -- that you hope you take from this book?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  The basic principle is bring humanity back into the workplace.  Respect, listening, caring about people, helping them achieve their objectives.  This is what Bill was all about.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And that could be an exponential game changer because still, to this day, the little people are still nervous about their jobs should they feel that they're part of the project and feel empowered and then get themselves slapped around.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, and the book is called \"Trillion Dollar Coach\" because Bill was both Steve Jobs' coach --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  -- as well as my coach, and the sum of that is more than a trillion dollars of shareholder value.  He's by far the most successful coach in the world.  And at Google, and I suspect at Apple, you would never be able refer to our employees as little people, right?  Our model --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm talking about on the totem pole.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I'm -- our model is huge empowerment to our individual employees, which I'm very proud of.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What did you get from him, from Bill?  I know he was your coach.  And also, wasn't Steve Jobs a little bit sort of nervous about Bill coaching all the competitors as well?</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Well, what's interesting about Bill is he managed to actually coach not just Apple and Google but many other companies in the Valley.  And he managed to do this because he was not involved in the product decisions.  He let the product decisions, which often were very complicated and different, stay separate.  He coached them, people, as individuals.</p><p>And somehow in the middle of all of the conflict between Apple and Google, he managed to do it and did it fairly to the satisfaction of both sides.</p><p>EAGLE:  And he built incredible trust, again, by listening, by being loyal, by being, you know, very careful with keeping secrets and he just built tremendous trust.  So, he could work with many different players.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Excellent.  Eric Schmidt, Alan Eagle, thank you very much.</p><p>SCHMIDT:  OK.  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  The book is the \"Trillion Dollar Coach.\"</p><p>SCHMIDT:  Thank you.</p><p>EAGLE:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now, we're going to take a cue from Shakespeare and his eternally timely, \"King Lear.\"  It too is all about power, a team of rivals and a big breakup of his kingdom no less.</p><p>Lear's decent into madness makes him one of the most challenging characters to grapple with on stage.  The latest actor taking up the gauntlet is Glenda Jackson.  At 83 years old, she's showing no signs of slowing down as she throws herself into eight shows a week on Broadway.</p><p>Fierce, funny and frank, it's a delight to welcome her back to this program between, of course, shows.  There you are in New York.</p><p>Welcome back, Glenda Jackson.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is exhaust, right?  I mean, it's very physical and all-encompassing performance.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, it is and it isn't.  I mean, I'm used to eight shows a week.  I mean, that was the work toll, that it was practiced in England when I began and still is.  But there is enormous energy in the play itself.  And if you can touch into that energy, and we do as a company, then, really, I mean, I sometimes feel more energized when it's -- when we've done it than when I started.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I wonder whether -- because you've also said that you think, you know, Shakespeare is perhaps one of the most, if not the most contemporary of playwrights.  And given all --</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, he is.  Undoubtedly.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  And we've just been talking about leadership --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- and power and corruption and breakup and ethics.  Where does he fit in for you?  Why do you call him still so contemporary?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, because he essentially only ever writes about us, about human beings.  And human nature is immutable.  Yes, we can and we do when we're still trying to improve the human condition.  But we, as human beings, don't change that much.  And there are tropes in the play that are absolutely reflected in the world as we know it today.</p><p>When I was particularly interested hearing the previous piece about power and leadership because Lear says in the play that he was flattered like a dog as the king.  People said to him aye and no to everything he said.  And the line is, \"Aye and no, too, is no good divinity.\"  And so, that is something that is still prevalent now.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, continuing that theme, this particular production of \"King Lear\" takes place, essentially in a single kind of gilded room.  And --</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- you know, it then turns into a bit of a ruin in the second part.  But nonetheless, as you can imagine, given the times we're living in, some of the theater critics have said, \"Well, that room, that sort of -- that room must be Trumpian.  It must be the Trump tower conference room.\"  I mean, do you ever think about that?  Is there any kind of truth to that at all?</p><p>JACKSON:  I think there may have been something there in the background but certainly, Lear is not that kind of person.  I mean, the point about Lear is that he's a man who no one has ever said no to in his entire life.  He was born to that position of power.  He's, obviously, conducted it well.  He says he's handing it over to younger strength than his because he wants to have a peaceful retirement, ideally with his youngest, most favorite daughter in probably the most favorite place in this kingdom.  And it doesn't happen like that.</p><p>And so, what he has known all his life begins in the most terrible way to fracture, to fall apart, to finish.  But his power is never something that he's had to question or has been questioned until this critical moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, we're going to be playing now a little clip because it has been filmed.  And we've been talking about ethics.  And he's now losing his faculties, but he's got one sort of clear moment and here it is.  Here's you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are.  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm.  How shall your houseless heads, your own [phonetic], your looped and windowed raggedness, defend me from seasons such as this.  Aaah!  I have ta-en to little care of this.  Take physic pomp.  Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, that last line essentially says it all, \"Expose yourself to feel what wretches feel.\"  Talk to me a little bit about that.</p><p>JACKSON:  It resonates particularly with me because when I was first elected a Member of Parliament, I think virtually every shop doorway in London and possibly in every metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, was the bedroom, living room and bathroom of some homeless person.  There had been major, major changes made in our social housing structures by the Then-Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had allowed tenants to buy their properties usually at way below market prices.</p><p>And there was no recompense in replacing those -- that social housing foundation with new social housing.  And although the number of people who were homeless in my country went down, we are now seeing those numbers going up.  And certainly, here in New York, we see people on the streets every night.</p><p>And it is that, for him, for -- certainly for Lear, he makes that connection.  And I'm truly certain it is the first time in his life.  I'm pretty certain he thought all the time before then, but no word, if these people don't have anywhere to live it's because they're too idle to work.  You would find that opinion being replicated even now.</p><p>It suddenly strikes home to him because he suddenly, in the strange kind of way, realizes that he has no home.  He has nowhere to live.  And it's that acknowledgment that when he had the power to do something, essentially, you prevent that situation, he ducked out of it.  He wasn't aware of it, actually.  I think that is a moment of genuine shame for him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really interesting because it's sort of builds on that theme, your -- King Lear's good friend, the Earl of Gloucester, who is also brought down by a disloyal child, he also finds himself, at one point, being confronted by a poor mentally ill man in the streets, and he gives him some money in the account (ph) and he says, \"So distribution should undo excess and each man have enough.\"  I mean, you know, contemporarily, that would be redistribution of wealth.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely, it would, yes.  And look how hard that is, and becoming harder, it would seem.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But it is incredible that those themes, I mean, as you say, they are so contemporary and so eternal.</p><p>JACKSON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Look, we make a big deal, I don't know why, about saying you're 83 years old and you're still doing this.  However, I think one of the reasons is the admiration that you still have so much gusto and so much, you know, spark on stage and get such great reviews and pulling in such audiences.  But also, I wonder whether Lear has to be played in your later years, in a later year.</p><p>And I just want you to think about that while I play something -- I hate to name drop, but I did interview Sir Ian McKellen and he played it on stage in London and talked about this connection between age and Lear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN MCKELLEN, ACTOR:  Well, there was a great actor in my youth, Ralph Richardson, a film star and stage star, who said in his typical wry, witty way, you get out of bed, it's a beautiful day.  The birds are tweeting, the sun is in the sky.  Your wife is being nice to you.  Nothing could go wrong.  And then, oh, you finally got your foot caught in a Lear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's kind of sweet they way he says it, but just this sort of inevitability, if you have the talent to play this in your -- in your -- in your later years, did you feel caught in a lear?</p><p>GLENDA JACKSON, ACTOR:  No, because the I don't -- Lear doesn't regard himself as being old.  I mean, he only acknowledges his age right at the end of the play and the part itself, actually, it demands energy.  I mean, it's not an old man's part in what was the kind of, oh I don't know, I mean, we're so hypocritical aren't we, as people, about age?</p><p>I mean, I remember when state pension age in my country was 65 and you expected suddenly, the day after you were 65 to have lost all the powers of understanding, not be able to walk, I mean, it's just ridiculous you know.</p><p>I mean, my birthday was last week.  I think I'm exactly the same the day after my birthday than I was before, but this thing about age is something -- I mean, you allow it to work into energy.</p><p>I -- one of the things I treasure most in my life is that by the accident of my birth, I was born in what we used to call the working classes, we're now called blue collar, I -- it was very simple for that class.  If you didn't work, you didn't eat.  And so, I have a very, very strong work ethic and I bless -- I bless my family for giving me that inheritance because it's been of immense value to me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And it's great actually, I just want to also -- there is so much ageism in society and sexism in society and here you are a woman of a certain age, and by the way happy birthday, not just playing this part, but also playing it as a woman.</p><p>And I think you were the -- well, one of the first women.  I think Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in, obviously, in the last century, but nonetheless, what you do make of that?  Did you ever get any misogynistic backlash?</p><p>JACKSON:  None whatever.  I mean, it is very, very rare.  I can't think anyone who's actually seen the play with me in it has raised that issue at all.  I mean, it may be -- we did have a gender bender battle in England and that has been triumphantly won by the group of actresses who created a company and kicked off that battle playing all the Shakespearean histories, all women casts, I think that battle, in the sense, has been won.</p><p>One of the touching things that was said to me -- no one has really, because I don't play it as a woman in that sense.  I mean one of the benefits of my being a member of</p><p>Parliament was that I visited old people's homes, day centers, places that helped people with disabilities and things of that nature, and we are, as a race, a breed, whatever you like to call us, living longer and longer and one of the fascinating things that I saw was that as we do get older, there's absolute boundaries that define our gender begin to crack, they begin to fray.</p><p>I mean we are taught, are we not, to be boys or girls.  Babies, when they're born, they don't know what their gender is and as we get older they begin to be filtrated by something else and that's very useful.</p><p>But one of the audience members who waited outside the theater one night said to me, I've seen this play many, many times and it's the first time I've seen an aspect of Lear that could have a maternal quality.  I don't play that maternal quality, but it is, undoubtedly, in there.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  That's is such -- that is really impressive.</p><p>JACKSON:  . brilliant Mr. Shakespeare, isn't it?</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It is.</p><p>JACKSON:  . just fascinating.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes, that really is.  And we had the opportunity to talk to Kate Pakenham who was head of the Donmar Warehouse, who did that trilogy, of course, as you said, there's Julius Caesar and two others, all women casts and it was amazing.  But she did say, because perhaps she was the first there was quite a lot of backlash here in Britain.</p><p>And we've also explore a lot on this show about work and sort of useful contribution to society, even beyond the retiring age.  So, I think you're absolutely right, these issues are happening.</p><p>But I want to play another clip from something you did much, much earlier.  Essentially it's -- it's -- I mean, it's got a long, long title, but it's the -- the -- the movie \"Marat/Sade\" and we're going to take a clip of your performance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACKSON:  Why are they housing (ph)?  What are they dragging through the streets?  They carry stakes, but what's impaled on those stakes?  What do they have?  What are they dancing for?  Why are they wrapped with laughter?  Why do the children scream?  What are those heaps they fight over?  Those heaps with eyes and mouths?  What kind of town is this?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You do -- you do mad very well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, I'll say thank you, even though I have my doubts, but thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, but it is interesting that -- I mean there's that much earlier in your career, there's this we show, two clips where you're really showing the frailties, the decent into madness, mental illness.  I mean, how do you -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, what I was going to say is, both of those examples where set in times.  I mean, certainly, the \"Marat/Sade\" was set in a specific time.  Shakespeare wrote his play in a specific time where the use of medicine was not there as a calming influence on people were having serious mental health problems and I think that is reflection.  So it's -- I mean, I think one of the areas which is very different today is that increase of medicinal calming.  I mean, I use that word, I mean it's the wrong word, but you know what I mean.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I do.  I do know what you mean, and very briefly, we've only got about a minute left.  You said that, in a recent radio interview, you said you think the inside me is about 15-years-old.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.  That's true, I do.  It's the envelop which carries our inside us that is increasingly disobedient.  Fingers don't do what you tell them to do, knees don't bend when you want them to do and the other amazing thing about reaching the age that I have is I -- I'm suddenly blinding aware of how little I know and how much there is that I would like to know.  So, I have a bit more time and can perhaps can close up those areas of total ignorance.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And what would be your next dream role, what happens after \"Lear\" for you?</p><p>JACKSON:  Oh, look, I mean I remember all those years when there was no work available and one was just desperate for it.  So, anything that comes through the front door that is something is welcome.  I've always felt, when a job finishes, that I'm never going to be employed again.  Let's hope that I can be wrong.  That's that one of the things that I hope I learn.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm sure you are wrong.  Glenda Jackson, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JACKSON:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And now we turn to a new kid on the block, a teenage filmmaker just starting out, but already making waves.  He's 19-year-old Phillip Youmans.  His first feature, \"Burning Cane\" snapped up three awards at this year's Tribecca Film Festival.  The film is set in rural Louisiana and it tells a story of a deeply religious woman and her struggle to reconcile her faith with the love that she holds for her alcoholic son and a troubled preacher.</p><p>Phillip Youmans has now made history as the youngest director to feature in the festival and the first African-American to win the top prize.  And our Alicia Menendez spoke to him about the story behind his amazing story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Phillip, thank you so much for joining us.  Congratulations on your recent honor.</p><p>PHILLIP YOUMAN, FILMMAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Tell me what this film \"Burning Cane\" is about?</p><p>YOUMAN:  So, \"Burning Cane\" is about Helen Wayne (ph) a mother living in rural Louisiana.  Her son, Daniel and his son Jeremiah and also her pastor, Reverend Tillman (ph) and their relationships with each other, their relationships with their religion and their community and how their environment and their home effects really every aspect in the fabric of their lives.  It's about how religion, it sort of governs their community.  It's about the cyclical nature of destructive behavior and how vices are passed down in lineage very often.</p><p>And it's also about the dangers of enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion and then taking religious doctrine (ph) literally.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What is the meaning behind the title of the film, \"Burning Cane?\"</p><p>YOUMAN:  Burning cane is a part of harvesting cane, but -- and it's a part of the culture and the fabric of the entire process in the community.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Sugar cane?</p><p>YOUMAN:  Sugar cane.  But, it also releases toxins that are very negative for people's health.  And so, I think there's just an interesting sort of a dichotomy there, in that it is such an important part of their economy about -- it's -- and sugar cane in that -- in that -- in that industry is an important part of the culture and the fabric of that area, but it is also detrimental to their health in terms of the toxins that are released in the air because of it.</p><p>So, and I feel like that sort of touches on the sort -- the multi-dimensionality of all the characters that kind of populate the film.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You finished this film up during your senior year of high school, 17-years-old.  Tell me about the process of making this film.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  So it started when I was 16.  In the December of my junior year of high school I wrote this short script called \"The Glory\", and then I wanted to make that short, but I stepped away to make another short.  And then after that, my instructor at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts named Isaac Webb told me that he thought that the film had feature length potential because of the fact that it was so grounded in character, that it seemed like it could be something that could be made feasibly.  And so, I just because like obsessed with that idea.  And then in the ensuing weeks and months I was just churning out drafts of the feature length script, going through script revisions, meeting actors all the while raising money and casting.</p><p>And then so in that summer before my senior year, we went into production and shot the bulk of principal photography and then shot Wendell's piece in that August, and then the rest of senior year was spent in post production.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  For someone who doesn't go to an elite school like the one that you went to, how do you make a film like this?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think at my age when we made this film, I relied so much on the fact that the artists that were my friends and a lot of my friends who weren't artists were just really behind my mission and my drive.  And when you can't pay people industry rate, especially when we were that young, you have to rely on people wanting to work for you regardless or wanting to work with you because they believe in your and they believe in the project.  And for me in that case, those are my friends.  So I've actually been telling people recently that I feel like if you're as young as I was making a film, I think you really do have to kind of rely on your friends and your community in a way to ban together and help you figure out some of those resource and some of those jobs.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said, \"I think now is probably the best time for \"Burning Cane\" to come out.  Why now?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, there is - there is - there is two parts to that.  I think that just - I think it's time for us to kind of take an objective look just at religion and its role in our community and how it plays into our advancement as a community.  And I also think in terms of making this, you know, in more like applicable sense I had to make the film then and now because of the fact that there was such a community around me that there was no other time that I was going to be able to rely on people's good will quite like I could then because the moment you turn 18, then you're an adult and people expect and entirely different thing, you know?</p><p>So when I was 18, we were already in post production, but when I was 17 I think we kind of - we were aware of the fact that people thought that we were just a student production and in that they were willing to give so much because they thought they were just helping out some kids.  And we were, you know, young, but we always envisioned this going farther than just, you know, a student project.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  There's a clip I want to watch.  It comes very early in the film, and it is Wendell Pierce giving his first sermon that we see in the film.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WENDELL PIERCE:  Now however it says he has died, he has learned that is not to be true.  That's not true.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don't mean nothing if you're going to lose your soul.  He who dies with the most toys wins.  He knows that's not to be true because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn't get him across Jordan into heaven.  No toys gets you into heaven.  It's the friendships that you have.  It's the kindness that you do.  Did you clothe me when I was naked?  Did you give me housing when I had no place to live?  Did you feed me when I was hungry?  Did you drink - give me water to drink when I was thirsty?  He who dies with the most toys wins.  What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Talk to me about the dichotomy of cutting between this sermon and then this man reckoning with his won demons?</p><p>YOUMANS:  There's some truth to what Tillman says in that sermon in that he believes that friendships and personal relationships are more valuable than material possessions, and I think most of us can kind of agree with that.  And I just kind of wanted to show the fact that there can be some truth that comes from this man and he can also still be broken.  He can still be a beacon for people that may oral status (ph) that pastors have but still be grappling with all those same demons on his own.  And it just brings about the question of whether or not we should be following anybody who can't really practice what they preach, but we should - should we even expect anyone to be able to do that?  That's a whole other question, you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did you convince Wendell Pierce to be apart of this film?</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>YOUMANS:  Well, I - so in the - in the - on the months leading up to preproduction - well, in the months leading up to production actually, I was working at Morning Call Coffee Stand in City Park and I was waiting on a woman named Lula Elzy who's also an alumni of the same high school that Wendell and I went to - the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.  And I went up to Ms. Elzy and I was waiting on her table.  And she asked me about what I wanted to do, what school I went to.  And then I was talking to her about some of the roles in the project.  I told her that we had casted pretty much every role except this preacher, and I was just kind of explaining, you know, the preacher's motivations, where he was in this life.</p><p>And she said, \"what do you think of Wendell Pierce playing the role?\"  And of course I like freaked out, you know, because is Wendell is so - is big in our community not only because he's a brilliant actor, but because of - because of the work that he's done in Pontchartrain Park where he grew up, you know, and sort of helping stop all the gentrification that was coming through that area.  And then she texted him right in that moment and he responded to her quickly.  I think she said like, \"there's a (noka) student who's shooting a feature film this summer.</p><p>He's interested in seeing you play this role.\"  And he was like, \"OK, give him my email.\"  And so, I got his email and after that it was really just a back and forth with the script trying to make dates work, you know, looping him into all script revisions and - but Wendell coming in, it helped expand the community because initially the film was so much more centered on Daniel and Helen's relationship as a mother and son.  What Wendell came in and allowed is to kind of build this entire portrait as a community and show - and show how Helen's religion and the people that she associates with her religion, how they directly affect her actions with her loved ones and her family.  So it's just - it allowed the entire story, the entire community of Laurel Valley to be flushed out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  How did working with Wendell change you as a director?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I think before working with Wendell or even before \"Burning Cane\" I had - I had kind of a messed up idea about what directing was.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  What did you think it was?</p><p>YOUMANS:  I thought it was so much more, you know, commanding, so much more - so much more authoritarian than it really is and than it really should be.  It's so much more about the conversations that you have and sometimes maybe even the conversations that you have before you even show up to set, you know?  And I think what working with Wendell and Kaia and Dominique kind of taught me is that they're brilliant actors and you have to give brilliant actors the space to create alongside you.  It was just a - it was just a back and forth, you know, dialogue, and I mean, he made all the great choices, so it's - yes, it worked out.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  He's not the only character in the film that struggles with addiction.  Let's take a look at another clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The main character, this is her son dancing around with his son, passes the little boy a bottle.  Talk to me about addiction.</p><p>YOUMANS:  So addiction runs through my family.  Alcoholism is probably the most prevalent example of that, and before I made \"Burning Cane\" actually it was when I was 17 in junior year I kind of had a little spout of alcoholism myself because I was always able to grow a beard pretty easily.  And so, I would go up to - go up to like discount stores in the city (inaudible) and get alcohol because they didn't ID me because I looked older.  But I was really kind of self medicating because I was at a particularly low point then.  I was insecure, jealous, and it really kind of sabotaging the relationship I was in.  And then it wasn't making things any better when the girl that I was dating at the time she was also dealing with some sort of alcoholism with her own family and her own father, you know?</p><p>So it was just - there was kind of cycle in that and I recognize that it was self medicating.  And my mother caught me actually a few times.  That why she told me to shave the beard.  After that, you know, as stopped drinking as much.  You know, I stayed away from hard liquor.  And so, I just kind of - I had my own personal experiences with some of the jealously and insecurity and alcoholism that Daniel kind of finds himself with.  All be it, Daniel's is much more magnified</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>And has a much, much harsher context in terms of him being an adult and having to care for his child and all of that.  But what I wanted to really touch on with Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship more than anything in that sort of sphere of alcoholism is just the fact that things can get passed on so easily.</p><p>That's another thing that's sort of cyclical, in the cyclical nature of vices and how they're passed on from generation to generation.  And it's -- that's something that present in the movie not only in alcoholism but also in smoking.</p><p>When it's routine, when it's normalized, it's so easy to let that become a part of your routine and I definitely wanted to touch on that with \"Burning Cane\" and Daniel and Jeremiah's relationship.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  The mother Helen was played by Karen Kaia Livers, one of the more complex and dynamic characters in this film.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAREN KAIA LIVERS, ACTRESS:  It was Mr. (inaudible) son Tyde (ph) who helped me to get up.  And by the grace of God, I could walk away.  I was scared I was going to have to be in a wheelchair.  But you know, with the help of the Lord, I'll be fine and I'll survive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's great, mom.  I'm glad to see that you're doing OK.</p><p>LIVERS:  Eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You said Wendell is our lead male character, but the story revolves around Helen and her decisions, her experiences define \"Burning Cane.\"  How so?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, Helen is a character in \"Burning Cane\" that has the major dramatic question that really has the major decision to make.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is?</p><p>YOUMANS:  Which is how does she proceed with knowing the man that her son has become.  And how does she feel as a mother, is there any guilt that she feels for how he's turned out.  And it's also how does she respond, what action does she take to what he's done.  And with--</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Which is not just his grappling with his alcohol addiction--</p><p>YOUMANS:  No, no, no.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  -- but also with domestic violence.</p><p>YOUMANS:  Yes, yes.  And what I wanted to speak on especially with Helen is that there is a danger in enacting a fundamentalist interpretation of religion.</p><p>And that by the end of the film, she takes  Tillman's words and his guidance literally and in that, in that very fundamentalist interpretation of what she's saying -- what he says she takes action from that.  But her major question is how does she help the people and the men in her life really that she loves, a pasture, her grandson and her son Daniel.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  You've said my artistic identity is defined by humanizing more than it is by my blackness.  What does that mean?</p><p>YOUMANS:  So, I am -- I want to tell honest nuance black stories.  There's an (inaudible) and that is always going to be a part of my work.  But I think above all that, if not even above all of that but in kind of in tandem with that is showcasing the duality and the nuance of our experience.</p><p>But I think there's something important about us being able to as black people be able to tell our stories and be able to show ourselves in that (inaudible) light.

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We'll start today's show with the tour of the globe. French President Macron's claim that NATO is facing brain death in the Trump era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ukraine's continued central role in America's impeachment inquiry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And China, will Xi get a new trade deal with Trump? All that with Niall Ferguson, Richard Haass and Rana Faroohar.</p><p>Also 30 years ago this weekend, the Berlin wall cracked. At the time there was much excitement and hope for the future. What happened?</p><p>Finally, work, work, work, work, work. The standard five-day workweek began in a New England mill more than 100 years ago. But is four days at your job actually more efficient? We've done the work to help you figure it out.</p><p>But first, here's my take. There is an odd growing consensus these days that American democracy needs to be saved by Mark Zuckerberg. People from Elizabeth Warren to Aaron Sorkin are demanding that Facebook stop running obviously false political advertising.</p><p>So let me pose a question. Would everyone be as comfortable if the person deciding what constitutes real news versus fake news were not Zuckerberg but Rupert Murdoch?</p><p>It's not a fantasy. In 2005 News Corp. bought MySpace, then the leading social network on the planet. Had things worked out differently, it would be Murdoch or a band of FOX News experts who would be determining what counts as legitimate political speech.</p><p>Are you still comfortable?</p><p>Broadcast networks cannot censor political ads because doing so would be considered an infringement of free speech on their large public platforms. Cable companies like CNN are not regulated the same ways and thus can make their own decisions. Facebook, of course, is a larger platform than all the networks combined. It now serves as a sort of global public square and surely it should be open to political speech. The criticisms of Facebook are varied and many of them are valid. It has been far too lax in allowing and even promoting incendiary messages that end up provoking violence as in countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. It also acts as a quasi-monopoly, snuffing out competition, which is a separate matter.</p><p>Many argue that Zuckerberg is being disingenuous when he claims that Facebook is a neutral platform open to all views equally. In fact Facebook's algorithm promotes certain kinds of material over others which can help spread fake news, exaggerations and lies.</p><p>Now the algorithm encourages engagement and intensity of belief. That helps, say, stamp collectors and animal lovers get more of the content they crave. It helps Elizabeth Warren supporters see material they like and it helps Trump-leaning voters see the stuff that excites them as well.</p><p>Here's the real issue. America has become deeply polarized, and each side wants to believe the worst slander and lies about the other, and the problem is worse on the right than the left. The situation with Facebook is a symptom of this problem. If Facebook didn't exist, Trump supporters would listen to talk radio, watch FOX, go to other Web sites. Facebook accentuates partisanship more than it causes it.</p><p>Professor Jeremy Weinstein, who teaches a blockbuster class at Stanford on computers, ethics and public policy, explains that, \"It makes very little sense to think that these choices about what speech is allowed and not allowed should be made by unaccountable tech CEOs behind closed doors in a corporate boardroom. Companies are focused on their own bottom line which is best catered for if they maximize engagement, attachment to their platforms.\"</p><p>I don't want Mark Zuckerberg deciding what speech is legitimate in America. I want the government to set parameters for him and other technology companies as to their obligations for what they increasingly are, large news platforms. There are many good ideas out there. Invoke something like the Fairness Doctrine which for decades required broadcast networks to include a range of views in their programs.</p><p>[10:05:04]</p><p>Ellen Weintraub, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, has a simple suggestion. Don't allow microtargeting, serving ads to a very specific segment of the population, which stokes division and hostility and is often cloaked in secrecy.</p><p>Americans feel overwhelmed in the digital era by the power of the tech giants but Weinstein argues they distrust government even more than they do the tech companies, so they want Facebook to regulate American democracy. What we need is the opposite. American democracy should regulate Facebook.</p><p>For more, go to CNN.com/fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week. And let's get started.</p><p>Let's get right into the events of the week with today's terrific panel. Richard Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former director of policy planning at the State Department. Niall Ferguson is an author and historian, he is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. And Rana Foroohar is a global business columnist for the \"Financial Times\" and a global economic analyst for CNN, and she has a new book out called \"Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed its Founding Principles and All of Us.\"</p><p>So, Rana, I have to ask you, what do you think of what I just said about Facebook?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Well, I think it was a provocative position, and I like that part. I think that you can argue the idea of whether Facebook should be policing free speech either way. And I think that you make a strong case that, you know, maybe you don't want Mark Zuckerberg deciding what's truth and what's not, but I think what's really interesting here and what gets lost, one of the reasons that Facebook and Google and the other big tech platforms don't want to deal with political speech is that they don't want the exemptions that they get as being Internet platform companies to be taken away.</p><p>There's a wonky provision, CDA 230, which was in 1996 part of the Communications Decency Act. That allows them to be not liable for anything that is done or said on their platforms. Once that goes away, then the black box of algorithms is opened up and you can really see into this targeted advertising business model. And that is something that is under big debate right now not just in the U.S. but in the E.U. Should we be allowing this kind of surveillance capitalism to exist? How should it be regulated if people can --</p><p>ZAKARIA: So you think they would resist?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I do. I think --</p><p>ZAKARIA: The end of microtargeting.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think that that is their whole business model. I mean, if you think about it. These are advertising companies. Facebook and Google get 80 percent, 90 percent of their revenue from advertising. They're giant media and advertising firms. If you take away targeted advertising, they don't really have a business model anymore.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Rana, in your book, says we're in a new era. That the crisis of the old order, the old free reign for tech is over. You wrote a book about some of these issues, terrific book.</p><p>NIALL FERGUSON, SENIOR FELLOW, STANFORD'S HOOVER INSTITUTION: \"The Square and the Tower.\"</p><p>ZAKARIA: \"The Square and the Tower.\" What do you -- do you think we are in a new age of regulating big tech?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, the question is how. I agree with Rana that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is the Achille's heel of the big tech companies. And that is why they would much rather that Washington went down the road of anti-trust because they can win that fight or at least they can protract it. And it's a far less serious a threat than removing or removing Section 230.</p><p>Just to be clear, because I think most viewers and certainly most legislators don't get this. The key for Section 230 is it's like the catch 22 of the Internet because it essentially allows them to say, when it suits them, we're not publishers. We're just technology platforms. It's nothing to do with us, what appears in the platform. But when it suits them to curate, edit, remove, then they say oh, we're perfectly within our rights.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>FERGUSON: There's no First Amendment that applies here because we're private corporations. So they are publishers when it suits them to be and they're technology when it suits them to be, which is fine when they were tiny, little, weeny startups in the mid-1990s. I can see why that Section 230 was written. But it's a complete anachronism now. And that's where Washington, that's where Congress should be focusing its attention. Not on anti-trust which I actually think is a wild goose chase.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All right. We got it -- there's too much to talk about. So China. There seems to be some kind of a deal. Do you think this is -- this means relations between the Trump administration and China have kind of turned a corner?</p><p>RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: In a word, no. For two reasons. One is it's a deal, but it's a deal light. This is not a comprehensive omnibus trade deal. It's more significant for what it doesn't really include, questions of state subsidies. The monitoring of technology issues and so forth. Simply to have reciprocal tariff reduction is not the big thing.</p><p>Second of all, you've got a host of other issues, whether it's human rights, political control by governments, South China Sea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Uighurs, what have you.</p><p>[10:10:00]</p><p>This relationship has moved more negatively, more quickly than any major foreign policy issue I can think of, Fareed, in years. So this is not going to be a transformational moment at all.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So the markets are wrong to celebrate?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Absolutely. I mean, the markets are responding to the fact that algorithmic trading programs look for good news about China in the U.S. And they go up and down based on that. It's -- I completely agree, it's false optimism. I mean, this is part of the big tech story as well, though, because the trade war is a tech war, is an existential war about who's going to control the high growth industries of the future. And that gets to the fact that we're not going back to a reset no matter who is in office in 2020. We're not going to go back to a reset of the '90s. I think that the U.S. and China and potentially Europe are moving in different directions in terms of how to regulate the Internet, how digital trade will be done. What the rules of the road will be. It will be interesting to see where Europe goes because China's \"One Belt, One Road\" infrastructure plan is also about rolling out 5g and 5g standards into Europe.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Very quickly, you've said you think we're the start of a new Cold War with China. You think it's sort of that -- it's that serious?</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes. I agree, but I'd go further than Richard and Rana. I think Cold War II has begun and the market's fixation on the trade negotiations is distracting people from the reality that the tech war is much more important. And China's vulnerability is actually in hardware because it imports more high-end semiconductors than it imports oil in terms of dollar values. That's China's vulnerability.</p><p>It will take way beyond 2025 for them to be self-sufficient in that area. And that is I think where the U.S. is going to be applying much more pressure in the years to come. Tariffs are a blunt instrument. That's a very precise one.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Don't go away. Next on GPS, if you heard the reports this week that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was planning to announce here on GPS that he was investigating the Bidens, you might have wondered what was that all about? I will explain when we come back.</p><p>[10:15:36]</p><p>ZAKARIA: You may have heard that I was preparing to interview Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for GPS. It's true and I wanted you to hear it from me. We had been trying to get an interview with Zelensky since shortly after he was elected. He's a fascinating character and his country's struggles with Russia are an important geopolitical story.</p><p>Those efforts to talk to Zelensky picked up speed in September. I met him in Kiev in the middle of that month. I asked for an interview and he agreed in principal. The GPS began coordinating with his team and preparing the logistics of taping an interview. Then on September 19th the \"Washington Post\" reported that the whistleblower's complaint revolved around Ukraine. Shortly thereafter the Ukraine has pulled the plug on the planning.</p><p>Of course, none of us were aware of a secret campaign to pressure him nor that Zelensky had agreed to announce an investigation into Joe Biden or his son on GPS as the \"New York Times\" has suggested. We will reengage with President Zelensky and hope to be able to bring you an interview with him at some point.</p><p>Let me bring back, Richard Haass, Niall Ferguson and Rana Foroohar.</p><p>So where do we stand in your view with the impeachment? The extraordinary thing it seems to me is you now have five or six senior officials who have pretty much laid out a quid pro quo, that there was pressure on Ukraine, and, you know, the quid was the military aid, the quo was you've got to announce, whether on my show or somewhere else, publicly that there was an investigation into Bidens. Where does that leave us?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, I think we're on track for the House to impeach President Trump. I think it's significant politically because unlike the Mueller report, the Zelensky call and all the fallout that there has been since the partial transcript was released have really moved independence on this issue. If you look at the polling, during the whole Mueller era, only about 30 percent of independents thought that Trump should be impeached and removed. It's now 51 percent on the most recent pollings.</p><p>I think that's significant politically. Now, of course, the Senate is not going to find the president guilty and remove him. And that I think is absolutely clear. However, I don't think Mitch McConnell is simply going to kick this into the long grass. I think there will have to be some kind of process in the Senate.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So -- so what -- let's assume what Niall is saying is right, impeached, acquitted, he goes into reelection. Net, net, does it hurt him or help him? Because he's going to say I was vindicated, I was acquitted by the Senate. That is the word.</p><p>HAASS: He will say that. It's also possible he'll be censured in the Senate. That could become a halfway house between what you'd call acquittal and removing him from office. He'll put positive spin, say it proves it was a witch hunt. The Democratic candidate whoever he or she may ultimately be will obviously say different.</p><p>I think the real question is public opinion. Does it turn? And that's the only thing that conceivably moves 20 Republicans away from the president or I think it's a distant shot, and then during the general election. What is public opinion? Does this -- that's what really matters. What are the American people concluded? What does this really lead them to do, whether they give him another four years or not?</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you think -- if I can change subjects quickly, do you think that America needs another billionaire this time, a real one from New York who is worth about 20 times what Donald Trump is purportedly worth to save American democracy?</p><p>FOROOHAR: It is a game-changer. You know, I did a column a while back when Howard Schultz was running, and I said, we don't need another billionaire. Michael Bloomberg is a little different. I mean, this is someone who has clearly started from very modest means, made his entire fortune. Has given a lot of it away. Is a proven leader.</p><p>I think the real question is, how his background, he is a Jewish billionaire. How does that play in the Midwest, in the south, in red states?</p><p>ZAKARIA: Pro-gun control, pro-gay marriage.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Pro-gun -- yes. You know, but, boy, it's really -- as they say in the U.K., throwing the cat amongst the pigeons.</p><p>ZAKARIA: In the U.K., by the way, you have the choice now between Jeremy Corbyn, who is really a socialist, and a hard Brexit in Boris Johnson. But it seems like Johnson is going to win.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, you used the word seems. Look carefully at this election. And there are all kinds of ways that it can actually go wrong for Boris Johnson. You know, British first passed the post system means that it's all about constituency candidates.</p><p>And I worry about how far the Conservatives are going to get where they need to get to, to a majority. They don't have one now. They've been in power nine years. They're going to lose seat in Scotland to the Scottish Nationalists, in England to the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage is running around with his Brexit Party taking votes away from them in other parts of the country.</p><p>[10:20:11]</p><p>It's a bigger mountain for Boris Johnson to climb than the national headline opinion polls would lead you to think. And if there's one thing we've learned from recent years, don't base your views on national opinion polls.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Meanwhile, our French ally, Emmanuel Macron says NATO is brain dead and it's all Donald Trump's fault.</p><p>HAASS: He called the American president unstable. Look, NATO has issues, shall we say? On the other hand, it obviously faces a significant Russian threat. And the problem with President Macron's position reminds me of the health care debate. It's repeal without replace. There's not a serious European alternative to NATO. So the real question is how do you basically keep NATO intact, dealing with Turkey, dealing with Donald Trump, dealing with this Italian government?</p><p>Because you need NATO to live, how would I put it, not to fight, but to be ready to fight another day. So I don't think walking away from NATO, if anything, it actually feeds into Donald Trump's argument that we don't have to take it seriously. It's the only thing we still have that ties America to Europe and basically keeps the Russians out. So I think the French president was way off base.</p><p>ZAKARIA: We will have to leave it there and reconvene. Fascinating. Thank you, guys.</p><p>Next on GPS, what if I told you that a government employee in a relatively obscure central African country had enough money to buy Michael Jackson's famous white glove? What if I also told you he also bought yachts, a Malibu beach house and 100-room Parisian mansion.</p><p>\"What in the World\" coming up next.</p><p>[10:25:52]</p><p>ZAKARIA: Now for our \"What in the World\" segment. When President Trump suggested holding the G7 at his Doral golf resort, many Americans were incredulous. Even the hint that a sitting president might try to derive financial benefit from his office was unthinkable. But in much of the world, that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Take the oil rich and governance poor nation of Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa. The president has been in power for 40 years and is believed to be richer than Queen Elizabeth. The U.S. Department of Justice has said his son, Vice President Teodoro Obiang, amassed more than $300 million by, quote, \"relentless embezzlement and extortion,\" unquote.</p><p>Obiang admitted no wrongdoing, but on a government salary, he has amassed an eye-popping array of assets. Some of which have been seized over the years. They include a Malibu beach house, 101-room Parisian mansion, yachts, and Michael Jackson's famous white glove encrusted with Swarovski crystals.</p><p>Meanwhile, a majority of the population of Equatorial Guinea lives on less than $2 a day. Across the globe between $20 billion and $40 billion is stolen every year by public officials according to the World Bank. Usually that money is embezzled from poor countries and spirited to rich ones through shell companies.</p><p>But corruption at the top has been hard to fight. As the Cambridge scholar Jason Sharman writes in his book, \"The Despot's Guide to Wealth Management,\" holding foreign leaders to account for looting public coffers is actually a revolutionary idea, at odds with centuries of practice.</p><p>During the Cold War leaders in the West needed allies in the fight for dominance against the Soviet Union and were happy to look the other way on corrupt dictators. But with the fall of communism and the growing expert consensus that corruption causes poverty, multilateral organizations including the U.N. began to forge a series of agreements to fight it. As Sharman notes, over time, those norms along with a groundswell of popular anger and ardent campaigning by advocacy groups have forced some consequences for corrupt leaders.</p><p>And \"The Economist\" reports some places that have long been havens for ill-gotten wealth are now starting to reform themselves. The \"Telegraph\" reports that the tiny nation of San Marino seized $21 million from bank accounts connected to the president of the Republic of the Congo, a man who reportedly spent more than $100,000 on crocodile skin shoes. And the FD says the tax havens of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man have agreed to share information about the true owners of companies after British members of Parliament lambasted them for complicity with money laundering.</p><p>The U.K. is now beefing up its investigative muscle, too. The \"New York Times\" reports that last year Britain began using something called unexplained wealth orders which can force people vulnerable to corruption including foreign officials to account for suspicious purchases.</p><p>The U.S. is perhaps the farthest along. It launched a kleptocracy squad in 2010 that later went after billions of dollars allegedly smuggled out of Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. There have been some significant results. The seemingly invincible former prime minister of Malaysia Najib Razak is currently facing trial for his alleged role in that 1MDB scandal. Najib pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.</p><p>But as \"The Times\" reported, authorities seized almost $300 million worth of assets from his homes last year including 12,000 pieces of jewelry, more than 500 luxury handbags, and $29 million in cash in 26 currencies.</p><p>The sprawling operation car wash investigation that began in Brazil upended politics across that region, toppling presidents and ensnaring politicians from all over Latin America.</p><p>[10:30:07]</p><p>Of course, significant challenges still remain. The vast of majority of embezzled wealth is still undetected. But this is mostly a good news story. Over the last decade, more has changed than in a long time, a cause for some hope.</p><p>Up next, the Democrats had some big wins in Tuesday's off-year election, but is that all indicative of what would happen next year in the big decision 2020? I'll talk to The New York Times' Nate Cohn.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Democrats are rejoicing this week. They seem to have taken over the governor's mansion in Kentucky, although that race is still contested, and now hold both houses in the Virginia legislature.</p><p>But before you decide this may bode poorly for President Trump, I want you to listen to Nate Cohn. He vies (ph) for The Upshot a The New York Times and the reported this week on the largest poll The New York Times has done on the 2020 election so far. It has some stunning findings.</p><p>Basically, the president is very competitive in the key states that swung him the Electoral College in 2016. And Elizabeth Warren faces a challenge in those states.</p><p>To discuss in detail, welcome, Nate.</p><p>So, as I said, the top line, it seems to me, is despite the fact that the president lags behind, when you do the matchups, Warren beats him by 10, sometimes 12, and Biden beats him by more.</p><p>[10:35:07]</p><p>And yet, what you're saying is when you look at those states that won him the Electoral College, he's surprisingly competitive.</p><p>NATE COHN, DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I think that's right. So these states in 2016 were four points better for Donald Trump than the country as a whole. In 2018 midterm election, they were five points better for Republicans in the nation as a whole. We have Joe Biden up two. So I think it would be very easy to go from our numbers to say Biden up seven nationally and yet, still the president would be in a really tight race for re-election despite that kind of national deficit.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And what do you think that's fundamentally about?</p><p>COHN: These are states where white working class voters represent an above average share of the electorate. In the northern battleground states, like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, they're a majority of registered voters. That's the president's strength.</p><p>And in our survey, we find that the president is winning most of the white working class voters who backed him last time or even those who went onto back Democrats in the congressional election. So these are states that are demographically favorable for him and we think he's taking advantage of that demographic opportunity, as he did last time.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And I think the other surprising finding is the one about Warren. Biden does pretty well though again. But, basically, it's competitive within the margin of error everywhere, but Biden does best, and Warren does poorly. Why do you think that is?</p><p>COHN: I think it's useful to break Warren's challenge up into three groups of people. Overall, we think that 6 percent of the respondents that we talk to and support Biden but not Elizabeth Warren against the president. Some of them just say she's too far to the left. They are well educated. They're conservative. They don't like single -- they're logical group of people.</p><p>Another group of people, they don't really know who Elizabeth Warren is yet. I think it's a reasonable thing she could make some gains among that group.</p><p>And there's a third group, which I also think is interesting. They say that most of the women who run for president just aren't that likable. They don't like Elizabeth Warren but they do like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. They're disproportionately young, they're disproportionately less educated, they're disproportionately non- white. I think it's interesting.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Arizona, I found that interesting. Explain what you found in Arizona and what conclusion you draw from it.</p><p>COHN: Yes. I think Arizona is really interesting. It was the state where Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren did best among registered voters. And I point that out because Arizona is a state where there are a lot of Hispanic voters who haven't typically turned out in American elections. And, in fact, when you narrow it to likely voters, that Democratic advantage dissipates a bit. But it's interesting to me because that one helps explain the national gap. These are states where, on average, there are fewer Hispanic voters than there are nationwide. And it's also interesting to me because one of the big Democratic hopes right now is the State of Texas. And in our poll, Hillary Clinton is doing rather -- Joe Biden is doing nine points better than Hillary Clinton among registered voters in Arizona than Hillary Clinton's four-point defeat among the actual voters in Arizona. How much did Hillary Clinton lose Texas by? Nine points.</p><p>So in the state that we have that's most demographically similar to Texas, we show Democrats making gains, gains that would large enough to keep Democrats competitive among registered voters in a state that -- you know, the state years ago voted for Republicans by nearly 20 points in the 2012 presidential election.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Why should anyone listen to you when you got the polls wrong in 2016? New York Times was predicting 90 percent of chance of Hillary Clinton winning.</p><p>COHN: We closed at 85 percent. And it's true that most the polls got it wrong. And I think people are totally justified in being skeptical about the polls today, and they should always be skeptical. Polls aren't perfect. I will say in 2016, we were the only live interview poll that had the president leading in battleground states in the final ten days of the race. We did it in Florida and North Carolinas.</p><p>And that's part of why we came back and said, okay, maybe we should invest in our own surveys rather than look at other polls. Because a lot of the other polls out there, they are not taking all the steps that I think you need to take in order to properly represent white rural voters who can be hard to reach.</p><p>ZAKARIA: The thing I always wonder about with polls is, I can't remember what the response rate is down to now. It's -- but it's 5 percent. I mean, number --</p><p>COHN: It's actually low. And even that number is better than it is in reality. They take away broken telephone lines.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Yes. So you have to call hundreds before you get one.</p><p>COHN: We called hundreds of thousands of people for this survey.</p><p>ZAKARIA: To get 5,000?</p><p>COHN: Yes.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So now my question is there must be some implicit bias, some selection, self-selection problem, which is the kinds of people who are willing to answer a poll are different from the kinds of people who aren't. I've never been willing to answer a poll.</p><p>COHN: Me neither.</p><p>ZAKARIA: What does that say? COHN: I screen all my unknown calls too. So I totally understand the concern.</p><p>What we -- what studies consistently find is that if you control for partisanship, if you control for demographic characteristics like race and education, the people who respond to telephone surveys aren't that different than the people who don't respond.</p><p>[10:40:08]</p><p>So if we didn't have the power, for instance, to make sure that we had the right number of registered Democrats or Republicans in this state, or if we didn't have the ability to up-weight less educated voters, our polls would have serious, serious issues. But we think that because we can account for those things, that we think our results are pretty good. They're not perfect. No one can make that promise.</p><p>But I think that we can make sure that our poll, in terms of its composition, is accurate and right on the sort of characteristics that are likeliest to predict whether you support the president or one his Democratic opponents.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Fascinating stuff. Nate Cohn, come back soon.</p><p>COHN: I will. Thanks for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Next on GPS, this weekend marks 30 years since the Berlin Wall began to fall. We'll look at Europe three decades later. What happened to that moment of great promise?</p><p>ZAKARIA: Thirty years ago this weekend on November 9th, 1989, an East German functionary named Gunther Schabowski altered the course of history by accident. The cold war was still chilly and the Berlin Wall still separated the east from the west. East Berliners could gaze at the west if their apartments or workplaces were on high enough floors but they could not go there.</p><p>[10:45:04]</p><p>For most, that was absolutely forbidden.</p><p>But Mr. Schabowski announced that night an hour into an otherwise unremarkable press conference, that East Germans could leave the country as they wished. This new policy, he said, mistakenly, was effective immediately. That night, the Berlin Wall began o fall.</p><p>Those were heady days. They held much promise for the future. But 30 years later, what does Europe have to show for that promise?</p><p>Joining me now is Constanze Stelzenmmuller. She is a Senior Fellow at Brookings and the Kissinger chair on Foreign Policy and International Relations at the Library of Congress.</p><p>So, where were you when the Berlin Wall fell? CONSTANZE STELZENMULLER, SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTE: Well, I was on the wrong side of the Atlantic for the action. I was a 27- year-old graduate student at Harvard, and I was sitting in my bedroom at my desk working on a chapter of my doctoral thesis when a friend called and said turn on the T.V. The wall is down. And I thought she was pulling my leg.</p><p>And I said you're an idiot. Leave me alone. I'm working. And she just said turn on the T.V. And I, just like an auto pilot, went into the next room and turned on the T.V., saw these people on the wall laughing and cheering and waving sledge hammers and bottles, champagne bottles, and I started crying. I burst into tears. It's incredible.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And so when you get there, what did you realize about Germany that you had not really understood?</p><p>STELZENMULLER: I got so many things. I sometimes think that, in retrospect, particularly for my generation, which literally grew up with the wall, our feelings about so many things had been in a refrigerator. And we had -- if you didn't have family on the other side of the wall, that you were sending packages to them with jeans or coffee and stuff like that, if you didn't have the possibility of traveling, which I didn't because my father was in the foreign service, and I would have been an intelligence target as a student, then that was -- could have been the other side of the moon.</p><p>And so suddenly --</p><p>ZAKARIA: So you in the west knew nothing about the east?</p><p>STELZENMULLER: I knew certainly much less than anybody who had family there or had been able to travel, which was possible to a limited degree for some westerners. But for me, this was a revelation that a country which, to me, had been emotionally alien, was full of people who essentially wanted many of the same things that we did and who very clearly family.</p><p>And this sort of reinforced in me a profound desire to both reconsider my own assumptions and revisit them physically. It's one of the reasons I became a journalist.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So you put it very well that people who seemed totally alien turned out to want the same things we did. And that, I think, was the great realization, and I put it in quotes, of '89, that all these people just wanted to drink Coca-Cola, listen to rock and roll, live in democracies, whatever.</p><p>30 years later, do you think that that was wrong? Was that assumption we made wrong?</p><p>STELZENMULLER: Well, the first point I want to make that all of these three things that you've decided are equally legitimate. It was -- I mean, some people sneered at the easterners for wanting rock and roll and Coca-Cola. And I think that that is a legitimate desire. And it is intimately related to the desire for freedom and democracy. And so they shouldn't have been sneered at by anybody. And I also want to emphasize that the following months and years saw an extraordinary spread of those freedoms and democracy, and prosperity throughout not just reunified Germany but through Eastern Europe. I mean, the standard of living, the political freedoms of many of these countries are incomparable to where they used to be 30 years ago, and yet we're seeing a populous resurgence all through the west, including in this country, and a distrust of representative democracy in ways that I find profoundly concerning because it seems to negate the achievement of those very heady years.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But the rise of populism in East Europe as a whole does feel as though it is the ability to -- for one thing, it's authoritarianism disguised because it doesn't come overtly, it comes through democracy after elections. It seems like it appeals to people's fears rather than hopes about immigrants and things. What does that tell you when you go on the ground and you talk to these people because you've done so much good reporting? What conclusions do you draw?</p><p>STELZENMULLER: Well, so a part of this, I think, is, of course, a holdover from the period before 1989 that -- and as we West Germans should know, if you have grown up in a dictatorship, you are likely to have had to make -- have made compromises with yourself, and with authority that you don't feel very good about and that you secretly feel guilty about, and that will pursue you all your lives.</p><p>[10:50:14]</p><p>West Germans took 40 years to deal with our complicity in World War II and the holocaust. Not all of us were Nazis. Not all the generation of my grandparents were Nazis, but an awful lot of people were, in some way, complicit. And I think there are similar discussions to be had in not just East Germany but in all the other Eastern European countries that lived under communism, and those discussions in our West Germany experience take a generation.</p><p>ZAKARIA: A pleasure, fascinating conversation.</p><p>STELZENMULLER: Thank you. This is so much fun. Thank you for having me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And we will be right back.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Does more time in the office equal more productivity? It's a question that's getting a lot of attention these days. And it brings me to my question this week. What did Microsoft Japan do that massively boosted productivity this past August?</p><p>[10:55:02]</p><p>Implement midday siestas, mandate three-day weekends, ban overtime or introduce unlimited time off?</p><p>Stay tuned and we'll tell you the correct answer. My book of the week is Rana Foroohar's Don't be evil. This is a fascinating highly engaging account of the rise of big technology companies and how they have betrayed their ideals and endangered American democracy. It will make you think hard about something we tend to simply accept as normal. The way technology now dominates our lives and societies.</p><p>The answer to my question this week is B, Microsoft Japan decided to close its offices every Friday this past August in a bid to improve work/life balance and boost office morale. They did a lot more than that, it turns out. Productivity jumped some 40 percent Compared to august 2018. On top of that, employees printed about 60 percent fewer pages and consumed 23 percent less electricity compared to August 2016. And data suggests working less could actually make us all better workers.</p><p>Take France, for example. Most full-time employees enjoy a 35-hour week and five weeks of paid leave per year, and yet last year, French workers got more done with each hour than anyone else in the G7, according to OECD.</p><p>So prove to your bosses you're a team player, always looking out for the bottom line and show them this clip.

Google still spent $9.8 million on lobbying so far this year. How it works: The companies have mainly used the money to present a positive message to Washington. Google, for example, has posted signs touting its privacy protections on turnstiles and walls in Ronald Reagan National Airport.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is becoming a regular presence in the capital. </p><p>He made three visits to Washington over the past five weeks, including a speech at Georgetown University[3] and a visit to the White House[4]. The big picture: The three companies are the subjects of broad investigations[5], notes Axios' Sara Fischer. Institutions investigating Facebook: House Judiciary Committee, House Financial Services Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and state attorneys general[6].Institutions investigating Amazon: FTC and House Judiciary Committee.Institutions investigating Apple: House Judiciary Committee.

Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc's Tim Cook - who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy - are set to speak via videoconference before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.  President Donald Trump, who has clashed with several of the biggest tech companies, on Wednesday threatened to take action against them.  \"If Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" he said on Twitter.  The president did not spell out what the executive order would say but has been irritated by tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, which sometimes take action on his postings on issues like treatments for the coronavirus. He has also clashed with the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos.  Facebook and Apple's chief executives have indicated they plan to use the specter of competition from China to push back against lawmakers seeking to rein them in.  Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.  The CEOs plan to defend themselves https://reut.rs/2P4lpYN by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term. https://reut.rs/2P4lpYNIn his opening remarks, Zuckerberg will tell lawmakers that China is building its \"own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.\"  Apple's Cook will point out that the \"fiercely competitive\" smartphone market includes China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , which has been a focus of considerable U.S. national security concern.  The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.  \"The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.  The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers' ability to ask pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.  It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to address content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.  A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Facebook Inc\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook \u2013 who together represent about US$5tril (RM21.22tril) of the US economy \u2013 are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.    Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.    The CEOs plan to defend themselves by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.    \"The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.    The hearing will also test US lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the Internet and technology work.

Facebook Inc.\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc.-owned Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc.\u2019s Tim Cook \u2014 who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy \u2014 are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.   Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.   The CEOs plan to defend themselves by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.     The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.   \u201cThe hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.   The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.   It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship \u2014 an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.   A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.

Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc's Tim Cook \u2014 who together represent about US$5 trillion (RM21.22 trillion) of the US economy \u2014 are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.    Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.    The CEOs' plan to defend themselves by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.    \"The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.    The hearing will also test US lawmakers' ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the Internet and technology work.    It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship \u2014 an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.    A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Facebook Inc\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook \u2013 who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy \u2013 are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.    Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.    The CEOs plan to defend themselves https://reut.rs/2P4lpYN by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term. https://reut.rs/2P4lpYN    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.    \u201cThe hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.    The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.    It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship \u2013 an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.    A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.

Facebook Inc\u2019s ( FB.O ) Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s ( AMZN.O ) Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O )-owned Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s APPL.O Tim Cook - who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy - are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.   Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly  insatiable appetite for data.   The CEOs plan to defend themselves reut.rs/2P4lpYN by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term. reut.rs/2P4lpYN    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.   \u201cThe hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.   The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.   It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.   A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly  insatiable appetite for data.   The CEOs plan to defend themselves reut.rs/2P4lpYN by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term. reut.rs/2P4lpYN    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.   \u201cThe hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.   The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.   It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.   A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.

Facebook Inc\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook \u2014 who together represent about US$5 trillion (RM21 trillion) of the US economy \u2014 are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.    Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.    The CEOs plan to defend themselves by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.     The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.    \u201cThe hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\u201d said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.    The hearing will also test US lawmakers\u2019 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.    It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship \u2014 an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.    A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said. \u2014 Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The CEOs of four of America's largest tech firms will testify before U.S. Congress on Wednesday in a hearing that promises a healthy dose of political theater, while also offering a window into the thinking of lawmakers trying to rein in Big Tech.   Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc's Tim Cook - who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy - are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.   Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.   The CEOs plan to defend themselves by saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.    The hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.   \"The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to Congressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with tech companies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.   The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers' ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big Tech operates. Previous high-profile hearings involving tech companies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and technology work.   It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big Tech companies.   A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four tech platforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.

Yet we see all of these companies, and the rest of our member companies, taking an oversized part of the solution and working hard every day, with the [Food and Drug Administration] and communities, to help solve this epidemic and take a larger share than perhaps the internet might contribute. </p><p>But while online platforms say they re only trying to be good corporate citizens, tech and health care experts think Silicon Valley is tackling the opioid crisis with more pragmatic concerns in mind. </p><p>Last spring s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/665506/sex-trafficking-bill-likely-opening-salvo-tech-platform-crackdown?mref=search-result\"> passage </url> of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) weakened, for the first time, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision protecting online platforms against lawsuits arising from content posted by their users. And as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and other lawmakers threaten to further undermine those protections when it comes to the illegal sale of opioids, most observers believe Tuesday s activity shows big tech is working feverishly to prove federal legislation isn t needed to fix the problem.</p><p> Absolutely the large internet companies would be interested in trying to show that they are undertaking voluntary efforts to address the opioid crisis, as a way of forestalling further regulatory intervention,  said Eric Goldman, a law professor and technology expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.</p><p>That could be a tall order, given the increasing sense on Capitol Hill that big tech has already dropped the ball on issues as varied as election interference, malicious bots, terrorist content, and political bias. With anti-tech fervor now sweeping both parties, Goldman doubts the platforms could ever do enough on opioids to satisfy skeptical lawmakers. </p><p>And Libby Baney, a consultant and senior adviser to the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, says a crackdown on the tech platforms over opioids would be an easy political win for lawmakers on either side of the aisle.</p><p> Every member of Congress needs something to say that they ve done to help save lives in their district,  Baney said.  And internet regulation is a popular topic. And so it s kind of a twofer. ... That s a recipe for congressional activity. </p><p>Lawmakers were already training their sights on the tech platforms  opioid policies before the passage of FOSTA. Last February, the top lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee joined several other senators in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-feinstein-colleagues-urge-tech-companies-clamp-down-illegal-online-drug\"> bipartisan letter </url> urging Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Pinterest to tackle the problem. And this April, GOP Rep. David McKinley of West Virginia upbraided Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for his platform s role in facilitating opioid purchases.</p><p>But it wasn t until September, during an exchange with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, that Manchin made the threat explicit. </p><p> We passed bills that held you liable and responsible,  he said, referring to FOSTA.  Don t you think we should do the same with opiate drugs and they way they re being used on your platform?  </p><p>After several rocky years culminating in a $500 million settlement with the Justice Department in 2011, Google has clamped down particularly hard on advertising for illicit drugs. And Beckerman s contention that the vast majority of illegal drug sales now occur offline is technically accurate. </p><p>But experts say that obscures the role the tech companies still play in facilitating offline purchases of dangerous opioids. Andrew Tsai, a health economist at Brandeis University, said drug dealers often use public tech platforms to promote and host encrypted messaging boards where prospective buyers can set up drug purchases.</p><p> A lot of time the street vendors will use any of the social-media platforms, like Facebook or Twitter,  Tsai said.  They ll set up a private group, and then use that private group to contact their customer and basically figure out a way to meet and to transact. </p><p>Kevin Martin, the head of Facebook s public-policy wing in Washington, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>that taking down such content is a top priority for his company. In addition to Tuesday s new partnership, he said Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/force-for-good/\"> rolling out </url> new artificial intelligence tools and algorithms to increase the proactive detection and removal of content facilitating the sale of illegal opioids. </p><p>Martin also pushed back on the idea that Facebook s efforts are being driven by a fear of federal intervention.  Obviously we re always concerned about when members of Congress have any concerns about what s going on, and we try to be responsive,  he said.  But I think first and foremost, this is a response to the community. </p><p>Most experts find that hard to believe, particularly given the increased congressional interest in rolling back liability protections and sticking it to Silicon Valley more generally.</p><p> I think there s definitely been a change in tenor and focus by members of Congress,  said Aaron Mackey, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who highlighted a  growing sense of concern, and willingness by members of Congress, to revisit Section 230. </p><p>Susan Molinari, the head of public policy at Google, denied that Tuesday s opioid push was designed to head off congressional activity. But she had a pointed warning for Congress should it decide to further undercut Section 230.</p><p> One of the things we want to constantly make sure they understand is, whenever we go into Section 230, it makes it more difficult for us to find the bad players for all of our platforms,  Molinari told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.  It does not allow to us be as aggressive as we want to on issues like sex trafficking. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-674664</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR8-2391-JBNW-3013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

It pumped $18 million into lobbying in 2017, up from $15.4 million a year earlier. Amazon, the next largest spender of the four, spent nearly $13 million for the year.</p><p>While Apple and Facebook spent less than the other two, they saw more significant spikes. Facebook's annual lobbying budget grew by about a third in 2017 from the year before; Apple's spending shot up by more than 50%.</p><p>The increased lobbying activity is a byproduct of both the tech industry's growing power as well the tenser relationship with Washington it has had under Trump than it had during the Obama years. </p><p>Silicon Valley has publicly clashed with the Trump administration over net neutrality, transgender rights, the travel bans and DACA. Behind the scenes, these tech companies lobbied on many of these same disputes, as well as global trade issues and tax reform. </p><p>\"The uncertainty of Trump means you need to cover more bases,\" says Bradley Tusk, a regulatory adviser who has worked with Uber and Tesla. \"You can't just count on the White House or the Speaker or whomever to carry your water.\"</p><p>It's not only Trump, though. The tech industry has also faced greater scrutiny from Congress, including hearings over the role social media platforms played in spreading Russian propaganda and extremist content. </p><p>Facebook lobbied over the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would require greater transparency for political ads online in response to Russian election meddling, according to its disclosure. Google lobbied regarding the issue of reporting online terrorist activity. </p><p>Reps for Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon pointed to its growing presence in Washington.</p><p>\"As one of the biggest job creators in the country, we've expanded our team in Washington, DC to ensure we are able to cover the growing range of topics that are important to policymakers, our employees and our customers,\" said Brian Huseman, Amazon's VP of public policy.</p><p>For Amazon, Washington used to be more of an afterthought. Amazon's chief concern was lobbying about internet sales taxes. But now it is moving into areas subjected to more regulation, including food, drones, and, reportedly, healthcare. </p><p>The latest disclosure shows the breadth of Amazon's interests. The e-commerce company lobbied about drone privacy and food labeling standards -- the latter in the wake of its acquisition of Whole Foods. </p><p>\"Amazon, which we consider a tech company, is also a grocery store. It's everything,\" says Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit group that tracks lobbying activity. \"Being so huge now, they are subject to regulation and to policies that just weren't relevant [to them] 10 years ago.\"</p><p>The same applies to the other tech companies. Google, which began life as a search engine, lobbied over self-driving cars, and Apple, once focused on personal computing, lobbied over health data, according to the disclosures. </p><p>\"The huge lobbying dollars spent by technology companies demonstrate that they have to explain their business models as never before,\" says Stewart Verdery, a lobbyist with Monument Policy Group, which works with Amazon and Microsoft. \"Americans are increasingly wary of privacy implications, impacts on employment, and social media's transformation of society.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley's isn't throwing money at the problem. It's also reconsidering who they have representing them as they face off with the Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress. </p><p>Google hired an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz for public policy and outreach. Facebook hired a former staffer for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Amazon is a client of lobbyist Brian Ballard, who served as a finance chairman for Trump's campaign in Florida. </p><p>This attempt to play political defense represents the new normal for Silicon Valley. As Tusk puts it, \"the big tech companies now understand that protecting their backs politically is just as much a necessary cost of doing business as HR or advertising or legal or anything else.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It pumped $18 million into lobbying in 2017, up from $15.4 million a year earlier. Amazon, the next largest spender of the four, spent nearly $13 million for the year.</p><p>While Apple and Facebook spent less than the other two, they saw more significant spikes. Facebook's annual lobbying budget grew by about a third in 2017 from the year before; Apple's spending shot up by more than 50%.</p><p>The increased lobbying activity is a byproduct of both the tech industry's growing power as well the tenser relationship with Washington it has had under Trump than it had during the Obama years.</p><p>Silicon Valley has publicly clashed with the Trump administration over net neutrality, transgender rights, the travel bans and DACA. Behind the scenes, these tech companies lobbied on many of these same disputes, as well as global trade issues and tax reform.</p><p>\"The uncertainty of Trump means you need to cover more bases,\" says Bradley Tusk, a regulatory adviser who has worked with Uber and Tesla. \"You can't just count on the White House or the Speaker or whomever to carry your water.\"</p><p>Related: Silicon Valley's impossible balancing act with Trump</p><p>It's not only Trump, though. The tech industry has also faced greater scrutiny from Congress, including hearings over the role social media platforms played in spreading Russian propaganda and extremist content.</p><p>Facebook lobbied over the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would require greater transparency for political ads online in response to Russian election meddling, according to its disclosure. Google lobbied regarding the issue of reporting online terrorist activity.</p><p>Reps for Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon pointed to its growing presence in Washington.</p><p>\"As one of the biggest job creators in the country, we've expanded our team in Washington, DC to ensure we are able to cover the growing range of topics that are important to policymakers, our employees and our customers,\" said Brian Huseman, Amazon's VP of public policy.</p><p>For Amazon, Washington used to be more of an afterthought. Amazon's chief concern was lobbying about internet sales taxes. But now it is moving into areas subjected to more regulation, including food, drones, and, reportedly, healthcare.</p><p>The latest disclosure shows the breadth of Amazon's interests. The e-commerce company lobbied about drone privacy and food labeling standards -- the latter in the wake of its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>\"Amazon, which we consider a tech company, is also a grocery store. It's everything,\" says Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit group that tracks lobbying activity. \"Being so huge now, they are subject to regulation and to policies that just weren't relevant [to them] 10 years ago.\"</p><p>The same applies to the other tech companies. Google, which began life as a search engine, lobbied over self-driving cars, and Apple, once focused on personal computing, lobbied over health data, according to the disclosures.</p><p>\"The huge lobbying dollars spent by technology companies demonstrate that they have to explain their business models as never before,\" says Stewart Verdery, a lobbyist with Monument Policy Group, which works with Amazon and Microsoft. \"Americans are increasingly wary of privacy implications, impacts on employment, and social media's transformation of society.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley's isn't just throwing money at the problem. It's also reconsidering who they have representing them as they face off with the Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress.</p><p>Google hired an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz for public policy and outreach. Facebook hired a former staffer for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Amazon is a client of lobbyist Brian Ballard, who served as a finance chairman for Trump's campaign in Florida.</p><p>This attempt to play political defense represents the new normal for Silicon Valley. As Tusk puts it, \"the big tech companies now understand that protecting their backs politically is just as much a necessary cost of doing business as HR or advertising or legal or anything else.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180124tech-lobbying-trump1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGP-FM41-DY60-K431-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Tammy Bruce filling for Tucker this evening. It's great to be back with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's like the early 2000s again. Rosie O'Donnell has been having another meltdown over Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROSIE O'DONNELL, TELEVISION PERSONALITY: This guy is in no means mentally stable enough to run this country and he should be impeached and every congressman who hasn't filed those articles should lose their little job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, there you go. We have more of that just ahead. Plus, Black Lives Matter crashing a police officer's own wedding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just wonder if you started planning your wedding before you killed Stephon Clark or after. I mean, how have you been sleeping since March 18. And I know this is supposed to be the happiest day of your life, he will have that moment ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: But, first, tech companies are taking the lead in suppressing any voices that dissent against the left. In the past few days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and other companies have all banned Alex Jones from using their platforms.</p><p>Also, Twitter purged various libertarian accounts, Instagram temporarily Tommy Robinson, Facebook took down a GOP candidate's ads for being allegedly offensive.</p><p>And Democrat Senator Chris Murphy says mass censorship is needed to ensure \"the survival of the democracy.\" I guess he doesn't realize the irony there. Who is next?</p><p>Well, on MSNBC, some say Twitter should ban the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC ANCHOR: Trump has insulted someone via Twitter at least 487 times. Is there a point in which Twitter says, this is a violation of our ethics, we're going to shut you down?</p><p>KARA SWISHER, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: I think there probably is a Rubicon he could cross, but he hasn't crossed it yet for Twitter at least.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, let's have this conversation now. Nigel Farage once led the UK Independence Party and spearheaded the Brexit campaign. He joins us now. Nigel, thanks for coming up with us.</p><p>NIGEL FARAGE, FORMER UKIP LEADER: Thank you.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, obviously, here is the issue. This is nothing new, right? We've seen this happening for quite some time. Even Diamond and Silk is a very good example on Facebook.</p><p>But you've got an op-ed in \"USA Today\" and you've got a very interesting idea about perhaps how we can start to approach this kind of banning and this assault on conservative ideas on social media. What do you have to say?</p><p>FARAGE: I mean, look, Mark Zuckerberg has always claimed that Facebook was a platform for all ideas. Fine. In doing that, he says I'm not a publisher. I'm just a means of people putting out their messages.</p><p>Whatever you think of Alex Jones and InfoWars, and you may say this guy is a bit out there, the point is he's got a big following, he has an opinion. And if you believe in free speech, if you believe in your First Amendment rights, people should be allowed to do this.</p><p>I would say that by banning Jones, by shadow banning many others, Facebook and others are now effectively becoming a publisher, and that means - because they are taking editorial decisions, they should be open to being sued as other media organizations are.</p><p>BRUCE: Now, I would argue because - look, we are all try to - how to find some balance here because we do clearly see it's unfair. We see - ranging from congressman being shadow banned to celebrities who have the wrong opinions, might be somewhat conservative, that we are trying to find a framework, especially with mainstream media being 85 percent liberal. And we see that push. But we are the content in social media which gives us an edge.</p><p>But let me suggest, though, that some of the argument by Twitter and what they're doing is they're saying that these comments violate their standards. And if we open it up to, let's say, lawsuits for a libel, wouldn't it make it even more difficult to have speech? Wouldn't more people be banned? Wouldn't there be more people suspended?</p><p>FARAGE: No. If you are a platform for all ideas, you are not a publisher. That is the point. What Zuckerberg and the other tech giants are trying to do is they are trying to have it both ways.</p><p>On the one hand, they claim, we are not publishers, we're not open to libel because we let everybody give their opinion. But on the other, they now, in a very sinister way, are starting to ban and shadow ban people.</p><p>I mean, take, for example, on Facebook, PragerU, an organization that I have spoken for. I've been to their events.</p><p>BRUCE: They do great work.</p><p>FARAGE: They do amazing work. I mean, their videos have been seen by tens of millions of people. They now on Facebook have 88 of their videos that are now very much put to the back of the list. They are very hard to access, including ones on Christianity, for goodness sake.</p><p>So, we've gone way beyond the bounds. What is needed now is a bill of rights for people using the internet. Let's give people access, let's give people rights. And if we can't get that, let's make sure that we now redefine Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as publishers who are liable, as are Fox News or \"The Wall Street Journal\" or anyone else to the content they put out.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, we've got to find a way to push back. And one of the strengths we have here is that we are the content, right? And there is a sense also that we're willing to put up with anything because our lives now, Nigel, are so intertwined, right, with Twitter, with Facebook, social media in general, it is the new modern way to communicate.</p><p>And my concern, of course, is that - we don't want them to go away, and yet, ironically - they are private public companies, they're not a government, they can do as they please. But I think the power is, as an example, this conversation. Our being able to have a point of view and make sure everybody knows exactly what's going on because since we are the content, we can at least push back and make a difference there.</p><p>Nigel, thank you so much for joining me tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>FARAGE: Thank you.</p><p>BRUCE: Great job. Now, look, we've got to find some way to be able to pushback. Harmeet Dhillon is the perfect person to speak with about this tonight as well. She's a civil rights attorney. She represents James Damore who was fired by Google for his personal views. She joins us now.</p><p>Harmeet, welcome aboard.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Thanks, Tammy. Happy to be here.</p><p>BRUCE: So, what do you think of Nigel's proposal about holding social media accountable as publishers to where they would be liable on issues like defamation, et cetera? I feel that that would be even more chilling because they are not the government, obviously, they are not compelled by the First Amendment to not act or to protect our rights.</p><p>What's your take on how conservatives can protect themselves and push back in this regard?</p><p>DHILLON: I actually agree with Nigel. Sorry, Tammy. I think it is way past time for us to do that. What Nigel is talking about is that these social media companies are all hiding behind the Communications Decency Act, Section 230, which gives them safe harbor, gives them immunity from being sued if they act as a platform, not as a publisher.</p><p>The minute they become a publisher and censor what they do and what they don't, just like a magazine, just like \"Newsweek\" or whatever, they can be held liable just like those publications.</p><p>Now, what these social media platforms have done is they have absolutely, with their digital advertising, sucked the life out of traditional journalism, so that the traditional journalism outlets are on their last leg. They're teetering into extension.</p><p>And they are the places - they actually can get sued if they do defamation. If they publish libel, they can be held liable, but these other platforms cannot. So, between their market power, which I think is something that the DOJ should look at with antitrust regulation, and with their, frankly, false advertising to being open to everybody, which Twitter promises, Facebook promises and YouTube to a certain degree promises, although they don't pretend to do that anymore, they are violating the law.</p><p>So, setting aside the First Amendment, I agree with you, this is not a First Amendment issue so much as a breach of contract and issue involving other regulations, some of the other things that conservatives can do is that we need to have members of Congress look at this Communications Decency Act issue, pass legislation, but we already have some government regulations in place that could help us.</p><p>We have the Federal Trade Commission. We have the Federal Communications Commission. They could both take a hand and looking at the uneven application of the rules to these different -</p><p>BRUCE: But, Harmeet, I get very nervous. I'm not a libertarian. I'm not even a Republican. But when we start seeing - and I think regulations can be very good. We've seen that when it comes to the environment that government does have a role, albeit a very limited one.</p><p>When we start talking about government agencies deciding who has to be heard and what must be done, I start thinking of things like the fairness doctrine which made talk radio impossible to have.</p><p>I worry about again this notion that when you are dealing with private/public companies, but they're not the government at the same time, Google, have very big role in government, involved with Barack Obama's administration.</p><p>They themselves - the market share - the value of them are bigger than some countries. Apple just, I think, became for the first time the $1 trillion traded company. Are you not concerned about government involvement in this marketplace framework where I think personal activism as the content producers can help make the difference on?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, of course, I'm concerned. And, frankly, government involvement as a conservative is the last resort, but sometimes it is necessary. So, for example, where we have doctrines that require equal access to certain platforms, for example, you have Facebook censoring Elizabeth Heng's ads when the Democrat, the incumbent, is not censored.</p><p>That is, to me, virtually an in-kind contribution by the platform to one side over the other. We can't have that in our system under our current law. I'm not saying new laws. I'm just saying apply the current laws to the situation.</p><p>BRUCE: Great point.</p><p>DHILLON: The other thing is that conservatives can fight back in the courts. And as you say, we're the content. But I'm afraid it's a little naive to say that. Unfortunately, we've had many years of American consumers acting like sheep.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, Google is free. These things are free. And now, we are in shame. We have to wrap it up now. I think this conversation is an indicator that things are changing. And thank goodness for work like yours. Harmeet, I appreciate you joining us tonight. Thank you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>BRUCE: All right. Now, look, right now, we are keeping an eye on Ohio where there is a closely watched special election - we all know about it - for a congressional seat. Republican Troy Balderson is running against Democrat Danny O'Connor for the 12th district seat.</p><p>Polls closed less than an hour ago. We're going to bring you the results of that race as soon as it's called.</p><p>And coming up, Rosie O'Donnell back with another anti-Trump meltdown. It's something to behold. That's coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O'DONNELL: Let your voice be heard.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>O'DONNELL: And let the president know in no uncertain terms that we are alive, awake and we are woke. We are not going away.</p><p>The more people that show up here eventually will take over all of D.C. and they will have no choice but to resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Alrighty. Well, that was, obviously, Rosie O'Donnell protesting outside the White House. The president, of course, though, is in New Jersey. Along with a group of Broadway performers.</p><p>The hostility between Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump goes back more than a decade. But, recently, Rosie has been inspired to new heights of derangement. Yesterday, she had a meltdown on MSNBC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O'DONNELL: He should not be president. And I don't believe that he is a legitimate president. I believe if it wasn't for Russia, he never would have won. He's a horrible, horrible human with no soul and he has a very serious mental disorder. There are so many psychiatrists who are trying out get out the duty to warn. They wrote a book. This guy is in no means mentally stable enough to run this country. And he should be impeached. And every congressman who hasn't filed those articles should lose their job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, you don't have to wonder where she stands. Then she took her act to CNN and accused the president's supporters, you guys, some of you, of being paid to attend his rallies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O'DONNELL: First of all, people are paid, Chris. You know that. People were paid since he went own on the escalator. He pays people to show up that -</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, \"CUOMO PRIME TIME HOST\": Right, but I don't know that that's why he gets tens of thousands at the rallies. I think he captures a lot of emotion for people.</p><p>O'DONNELL: He doesn't get tens of thousands. When did he get tens of thousands at the rallies? Tell me one.</p><p>CUOMO: Not at the Tampa. I think they only had 9,000 seats and there were people outside. But, Rosie, I've seen them. He gets big groups of people who come out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. Well, there you go. Gosh! Larry O'Connor is associate editor of \"The Washington Times.\"</p><p>Larry, isn't it a sign of the continued detachment from reality to say that Donald Trump is paying supporters? In a way, I want all Democrats to think that because they really don't understand what's going on.</p><p>You've got a piece on this today. What's your take on this return of hers and this very strange approach?</p><p>LARRY O'CONNOR, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\"ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Well, actually, I want to go one step further. I think that every Republican running for election this November should just play what we just saw on an endless loop, right? Let Rosie O'Donnell be the spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee at this point.</p><p>It really is a new level of derangement, but also a lot of the things that she's saying that we just saw just patently offensive, not just to Trump supporters.</p><p>But let's start with mental illness. Rosie has been public about her own bouts with depression. I don't know if you've known anyone with real legitimate mental illness, one thing you don't do is accuse somebody of having mental illness when they don't or if they haven't said that they do.</p><p>It's offensive. It uses the idea of having mental illness as some sort of pejorative. It's obnoxious. She did the same thing with the president's son, Baron, and suggested that the president's son had autism.</p><p>It's so out-of-bounds. She is just a horrible, horrible human being. And now, she's rallying people in front of the White House, tammy. It's disconcerting.</p><p>BRUCE: Broadway, especially. I live in New York. Broadway is an industry that relies on the tourism of middle America. It's average Americans, for some it's a bucket list issue, but traveling to New York is a fabulous something to do. It's their audience.</p><p>And it seems to me - people who were there, like who were in Hamilton. And the tickets are not cheap. We are asking Americans to spend a lot of money to see them perform. And I love performers. I think they are terrific.</p><p>But isn't this - everybody has got a right to be political, but doesn't this harm - considering the nature of what we have been experiencing in America, doesn't this harm - beyond Rosie O'Donnell, this kind of activism, doesn't it harm both their industry and the Democrat Party in general?</p><p>O'CONNOR: I worry about. I used to work in this industry actually before Andrew Breitbart discovered me and plucked me out of obscurity to be a political pundit of all things.</p><p>I used to work in the management business on Broadway and in Los Angeles. I adore this industry. I adore the art form. But if the entertainment business leans to the left, Broadway leans so far to the left, they have fallen over and they can't get up. They really are.</p><p>And I love the business, but the fact is, Rosie was just saying to her fellow Broadway performers there at the protests, make sure the president knows you are alive.</p><p>Well, he knows they are alive. But he also knows that all of those people that you're talking about are alive. The people from Middle America who save all their pennies, they come to New York, they buy tickets to a Broadway show. And when they see what these performers think of them, what the industry thinks of them, they might go on a cruise next time.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. Look, thank you, Larry, so much. I mean, this is a point where, at some stage, Americans coming together, finding and focusing on what we do have in common, like better paychecks, raises, tax cuts, safer country, we all benefit from those things and maybe it's time to start focusing on that.</p><p>Larry, thank you for joining me tonight.</p><p>O'CONNOR: Thank you, Tammy. Thank you.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, now, look, there's plenty of derangement to go around these days. In Hollywood, Donald Trump's Walk of Fame star has become a consistent vandalism target.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYS)</p><p>BRUCE: There he is with a pickax. On MSNBC, never trump Republican Rick Wilson became so worked up about Trump, he began cursing and the channel had to kill his audio feed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK WILSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: If there's a bigger never Trump movement out there, there's just a huge courage deficit in this country.</p><p>(AUDIO GOES SILENT)</p><p>JOE SCARBOROUGH, \"MORNING JOE\" HOST: Because of my past failures, and of course it happens every day, we had to implement a seven second delay. So, what you said will probably not make it out there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: And, yes, that's probably the best way to listen to Rick Wilson, is with silence. Well, someone you do want to hear from, who I know well and I enjoy her commentary, Cathy Areu is the founding publisher of \"Cataline Magazine\" and this show's \"liberal Sherpa,\" and we say that with all kinds of appreciation. She joins us now in studio.</p><p>Cathy, how are you doing?</p><p>CATHY AREU, \"CATALINE MAGAZINE\" FOUNDING PUBLISHER: I'm good. How are you?</p><p>BRUCE: Good. I've enjoyed being on as a guest with you, and so it's a pleasure to be sitting across from you.</p><p>Now, look, you've seen everything we've seen. You heard Larry. Rosie O'Donnell, she gets some attention. She's a performer.</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: She used to be a comedian. I don't laugh when I hear from her anymore.</p><p>AREU: Not with these lines, no.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, yes. So, would you agree - is this helpful for the entertainment industry and for liberals in general? It's been almost a year-and-a-half. Isn't it time to just say, OK, let's find what we have in common. Or is it all still too early?</p><p>AREU: With Rosie O'Donnell, I mean, this war has been going on for 12 years. It's personal. It's really personal.</p><p>When he was asked do you call women pigs during the debate, he said only Rosie O'Donnell. I mean, it's truly personal and then he became president.</p><p>So, this person you've had a war with for 12 years becomes president, so she's out there. She's not so funny anymore because she's so angry. If you go to Carolines, maybe she's hysterical.</p><p>But reality stars are in Congress. Now, there's one in the White House. So, entertainment, politics is mixing.</p><p>BRUCE: Would you say, though, that when it comes to their business that Donald Trump is having a better time than Rosie O'Donnell is or really anyone in Hollywood at this point?</p><p>AREU: Right now? At the moment?</p><p>BRUCE: Sure. Right now.</p><p>AREU: It's in the American way. It's the First Amendment. I mean, they have a right to do this. And Donald Trump was out there. He had \"The Apprentice,\" but he was still fighting with the birther movement.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>AREU: So, he did both. He juggled both.</p><p>BRUCE: Do you this star - West Hollywood just voted - not that they have a vote, but they voted to demand the removal effectively of Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Do you think it should stay there? Do you think it should it go?</p><p>AREU: He paid for it just like everyone else.</p><p>BRUCE: People might not know that.</p><p>AREU: They don't know that. He did pay for that star.</p><p>BRUCE: Everybody does.</p><p>AREU: Everyone does.</p><p>BRUCE: You buy the section. It's not like awarded to you and it's free. Everybody on the walk of the fame pays for it.</p><p>AREU: So, he paid for that star. That is his star. He rightfully paid for it. But if it's becoming a problem, if it's dangerous, if people are hurting one another over that star, maybe the city has to make a move.</p><p>BRUCE: Maybe they should be removed. Maybe they need to remove the people to prison who are taking pickaxes.</p><p>AREU: Exactly. Yes, the police need to - I mean, that's not right. No one should vandalize anything like that. That's his star. He earned it and he paid for it.</p><p>BRUCE: Now, look, you've got a really great attitude. You are not letting the circumstances which you don't like ruin your life. Look, she's laughing. It's a liberal who is laughing. We have great conversations that don't make us miserable.</p><p>AREU: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: Wouldn't you say that - or maybe you think it needs to continue, the current liberal attitude of all rage, all the time, especially from Hollywood? Do you think that that's worn out by now or do you think that's really the thing that liberals in Hollywood should be doing is the continual perpetual outrage?</p><p>AREU: I don't think it's all of them, though. We can't say all of Hollywood. We can't say everyone. That's the whole point. I'm a liberal and I'm not losing my mind. I think it's a small group, just with the GOP. I think both sides have extremes and both extremes are losing their minds.</p><p>BRUCE: All right. Well, there you go, except for us.</p><p>AREU: We are not.</p><p>BRUCE: All right. Thank you, Cathy. Doing her Sherpa best. Fabulous stuff. Now, look, the Black Lives Matter movement also has a new tactic. Wedding crashing. We will show you their attack on a police officer's wedding, coming up next.</p><p>BRUCE: This is a Fox News alert. Results are coming in in a closely watched race in Ohio. It's a special election for a congressional seat. Republican Troy Balderson is running against Danny O'Connor for the 12th district seat. Polls closed about an hour ago and we will bring you the results of that race as soon as it is called.</p><p>Now, fed up with blocking streets apparently and occupying college campus buildings, Black Lives Matter activists in California have a new tactic. One of the officers involved in a shooting death of Stephon Clark in Sacramento, California was recently married.</p><p>But on his wedding day, he had to confront invading activists.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just wondered if you started planning your wedding before you killed Stephon Clark or after? I mean, how have you been sleeping since March 18th? And I know this is supposed to be the happiest day of your life, he will not have that opportunity ever.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, guys. Can you get up?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, we came here to drink wine and also just ask you how you've been sleeping.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Alrighty. Robert Patillo is civil rights attorney. He joins us now. Robert, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT PATILLO, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Thanks for having me, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Now, look, for most of us who have seen that video, we understand the social argument about the need for - a lot of people talk about prison reform, but there needs to be justice reform. We know that there are problems culturally that we have to deal with.</p><p>This, though, transcends a line, in that we wonder what is it really going to accomplish. What is your point of view on this? Because this just seems - not only is it not really going to accomplish anything on the issues that we are facing, but it really is a provocative dynamic that changes this into such a personal framework that people are going to turn away from what the real answers could be. What do you say to that?</p><p>PATILLO: Langston Hughes once asked a question, what happens to a dream deferred? And this is what happens when legislation is not created that will address the needs of people.</p><p>For over a decade, people have been arguing and fighting and marching for the idea of comprehensive criminal justice reform in America. When it was hands up, don't shoot. Conservatives had an issue with it. When it was taking a knee, conservatives had an issue with it. When it was I can't breathe, conservatives had an issue with it.</p><p>What exactly is the protest that these individuals want people to have that will get them motivated on the issue of criminal justice reform? If we want the protesters to stop, we need to have an actual congressional leadership.</p><p>BRUCE: The White House, Ivanka Trump and the president, have both talked about the need for prison reform or justice reform. That's a discussion.</p><p>Many black leaders and pastors have visited the president in the White House and they get attacked for talking with the president about policy and about moving forward with the issues. Would you have a problem, would you go and meet with the president?</p><p>Do you have a problem with black activists and people, at least within the black community, who are leadership, meeting with the president to deal with these issues directly instead of invading a private citizen's wedding?</p><p>Don't you think one would more productive than the other?</p><p>PATILLO: Certainly. I agree with you completely. I think I've said on Twitter earlier, I applaud the pastors who are meeting with President Trump.</p><p>BRUCE: Good. Good for you.</p><p>PATILLO: I'll meet with the president all day, any day on this issue.</p><p>Frederick Douglas met with Andrew Johnson in 1866, a former slaveholder, to work out issues. The only way you make progress is by meeting, talking and pushing through legislation.</p><p>The meeting with the pastors and the president to push the First Step Act, it was absolutely necessary. And we need Senator Grassley to stop delaying the bill, get it out to the judiciary committee. We need less talk, more action.</p><p>BRUCE: You're a civil rights attorney. This is a conversation. This is about getting things done. But Americans see on television this kind of action of people trying to ruin - as they mentioned, they knew, let's ruin this guy's happiest day in his life.</p><p>You realize that you are not winning people. It's just not a way to win friends and influence people, that this conversation about things Americans generally agree on. We're all affected by a justice system that's unfair.</p><p>Is this the kind of thing that just keeps people distracted away from real solution? You have to admit that.</p><p>PATILLO: Tammy, unfortunately, these are things in America that get attention. There's going to be more attention on this story than there was with the 17 pastors meeting with President Trump last week to push prison reform.</p><p>BRUCE: You can talk to the mainstream media about that. That's one of the issues. What is the president - and how is the media covering the president's work. And when it's with the communities that the Democrats normally lay claim to, it doesn't get coverage. They don't want to talk about the president having success.</p><p>Instead, and this is what you should be upset about, the media promoting things that make activist communities look bad and then they play into it. I mean, isn't that something you should be speaking out against?</p><p>PATILLO: Look, if you look at the 1960s, if you look at the press clippings from them, they demonized the freedom riders, they demonized the Kings and outside agitators going into communities.</p><p>BRUCE: Who's they?</p><p>PATILLO: There is never an appropriate or acceptable way - there's never an acceptable way to protest until something gets done. I think congressional and presidential leadership on this issue will be what stops people from protesting. All they want is something done.</p><p>BRUCE: We both know the best protester in American history is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and we know the coverage of that. And it was powerful and it made the difference.</p><p>So, when media wants to cover something properly, they will. In this case, I think we are all being taken for a ride. But I love your position regarding the president and really having an influence on policy. Robert, it was terrific seeing you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>PATILLO: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>BRUCE: Tucker is back after the break. He will talk to a Democrat who he says his party has become far too obsessed with promoting abortion. That's coming up next.</p><p>BRUCE: Since the retirement announcement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, top Democrats have made their support for unlimited abortion rights a major campaign issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), NEW YORK: Do we deserve civil rights in this country? Do we get to decide what happens to our bodies? How many children we are going to have?</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY: Where generations from now, our children and grandchildren will wonder, what did we do, what did we do when they were trying to take away a woman's right to control her own body.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: Everyone who cares about saving Roe v. Wade will make their voice heard. Right?</p><p>CROWD: Yes!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Michael Wear directed faith outreach efforts for the Obama campaign in 2012. He just wrote an article warning that \"Democrats are entirely too focused on abortion,\" and he recently spoke to Tucker about that article.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: What did you mean when you said that, that they are too focused on abortion?</p><p>MICHAEL WEAR, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN FAITH OUTREACH DIRECTOR: Yes, sure. Well, there is a range of implications of Kavanaugh filling this seat that concern from the Democratic policy perspective, from immigration to voting rights to corporate power and workers' protection, and yet out of the gate, it seems like the only thing the Supreme Court was going to rule on was abortion.</p><p>And you saw major activists and even some Democratic leaders say that the preeminent focus was on Roe v. Wade, which to many Democratic voters, and I think many Americans, seems a bit off.</p><p>Certainly, if you are pro-choice, you have a right to ask questions and press Kavanaugh on that like any other issue, but it just seemed to be a bit out of perspective for me.</p><p>CARLSON: That seems to be a theme, though. I mean, I think there are plenty of people who think, under certain circumstances, abortion ought to be legal. Can imagine some circumstances where it ought to be allowed, but aren't onboard for, say, abortions for sex selection or third trimester abortion, think there should be some legal limits, some common sense limits on it and think there are moral implications of it. But that's not the position of the party anymore. Why?</p><p>WEAR: Well, right. I mean, I think the party has moved quite a bit on this issue, but it's been a relatively recent move. It used to be that Democratic Party, throughout the party, people called for abortion to be safe, legal and rare.</p><p>Barack Obama called as president for the number of abortions to be reduced. We actually saw the abortion rate in this country reach its all-time low since Roe v. Wade under President Obama.</p><p>So, it's not too long ago that you had Democrats that had a bit more of a humble approach to the issue of abortion, but something changed.</p><p>And in 2016, for instance, you had Hillary Clinton asked in the final presidential debate about her views on late term abortion. And instead of citing the Supreme Court decision on late-term abortion or instead of saying that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, she actually made an extended case for late-term abortion.</p><p>We also saw, in 2016, the Democratic Party platform for the first time include a repeal of the Hyde Amendment which bans federal funding for abortion. And these aren't long-standing positions and they don't need to be positions the party carries forward, especially at a time when Democrats are out of power in so many places.</p><p>CARLSON: I've met very few people whether they consider themselves pro- life or pro-choice who don't think abortion is sad, there's something tragic about it, there's a moral dimension to it no matter where you are on the spectrum. Why not just admit that? And why not just say abortion doesn't make you happy? We don't want a lot of abortions.</p><p>But if you said that today, I think you'd be disqualified in the Democratic primary.</p><p>WEAR: Well, if that's true, then Barack Obama would have to be disqualified. He called abortion a tragic issue. And again, he spoke repeatedly to his desire to see abortions reduced.</p><p>But it does - there is an activist portion of the party that, frankly - Democratic victory seemed to be secondary to them as long as party leaders take the most unapologetic approach to this issue as possible. And I think that we've seen the cost of that. We've seen the cost of that in President Trump being in the White House, we've seen the cost in someone like Sen. Pat Toomey representing Pennsylvania instead of Katie McGinty.</p><p>And my hope as a Democrat would be that the party would not take that approach in 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, you can see Tucker's full interview with Michael Wear on the TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT Facebook page.</p><p>Coming up now, the president's Twitter feud with LeBron James has liberals once again calling Trump a racist. Candace Owens joins us for that coming up next.</p><p>BRUCE: The left will accuse President Trump of racism no matter what, but this week their stated excuse is the president's Twitter attack on NBA star LeBron James.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, \"CNN TONIGHT\" HOST: This president traffics in racism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How the black community has come to view this president as someone who looks down on us and who has an attitude about us that is nothing short of racist.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are no longer at dog whistles. These are fog horns.</p><p>LEMON: The people of color who are attacked by their fellow citizens who feel emboldened to be publicly racist because the president is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Alrighty. Well, Candace Owens is with Turning Point USA. She joins us now. Welcome aboard. Great to be sitting across the table from you.</p><p>CANDACE OWENS, TURNING POINT USA: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BRUCE: Thanks for being here. It's just kind of nice. And, normally, if you're talking to Tucker, you'd be in a box with a satellite, but here we are in the studio.</p><p>Look, you're a young African-American woman. You we hear everybody talking about racism. We know racism exists.</p><p>OWENS: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: And yet, with this constant harangue on the president, a man who has clearly improved the quality of lives for African-Americans, the unemployment rate at historic lows, everybody having more money in their pocket, that really adds to personal freedom. What is your reaction to this kind of response to a president who actually said to a lot of people that they are dumb, white and black. How do you respond to all of this?</p><p>OWENS: That's the exact key that you just said. So, the left has been operating under this very bizarre assumption that you can't critique a black person in this country unless it makes you automatically racist. That's ridiculous. That's false. I'm critiqued every day.</p><p>Usually, I'm called a porch monkey and I'm referred to with lot of racial slurs in my Twitter feed because I'm a conservative black thinker.</p><p>The idea that you can't think somebody has a low IQ, provably low IQ - Maxine Waters is not a smart person. You can't say that because she's black. That's ridiculous.</p><p>So, the president insults a lot of people, black, white, Hispanic. He's definitely not looking at color when he talks to someone.</p><p>And, quite frankly, the way that LeBron conducted himself in that interview - and I don't want to take away from what he did. Opening schools is an incredible feat that he did.</p><p>But Don Lemon got him in that interview. Don Lemon was the smarter person in the room as Trump said. Don Lemon knew what he was doing for CNN. He wanted LeBron to say something about the president. They couldn't have cared less about the school opening.</p><p>They were there to get that five-second soundbite to get him say something nasty about the president and that was going to be their new story.</p><p>Unfortunately, he's brilliant on the court. He does not understand how to operate -</p><p>BRUCE: That's the obsession, is that the media has abandoned its job of informing Americans about a whole host of amazing things that are going on, including the issue of the jobs reports, the nature of what the tax cuts have done, this improves the quality of lives for everyone.</p><p>But you don't want to hear about that. They only want to hear about things if it's negative about the president.</p><p>At the same time, we are in a racialist dynamic, where race issues are used politically. And LeBron James said - and this is everyone's right - that sports is not enough for him. He wants to make a difference in the world. That's why we are here. We want to do that as well.</p><p>For him also, though, to accuse the president of trying to divide us and using the NFL take a knee protests, aren't those protests the dividing line and isn't the president defending effectively the country against that kind of racial division?</p><p>OWENS: That's exactly correct. And, look, I would welcome a dialogue with LeBron James. He is, in this regard, an ignorant man, OK? He does not understand. I was not going to refer to him as uneducated, but I'm going to refer to him as ignorant. He knows very little about politics.</p><p>BRUCE: That's really the rhetoric, though, everywhere within the black community generally.</p><p>OWENS: That is correct. But, listen, the reason why they really hung on to this and why CNN wanted to get LeBron James and they wanted him - they essentially attacked him without him knowing it and they used him to get this out because what was also released at the same time?</p><p>The Rasmussen poll. Black support for Donald Trump has doubled since last year of this exact same time. So, the rhetoric -</p><p>BRUCE: It's increased to 29 percent.</p><p>OWENS: Twenty-nine percent.</p><p>BRUCE: It's a remarkable transition.</p><p>OWENS: So, black people aren't believing this anymore. So, they're saying, what are we going to do? They go back to what they always do. They bring a black idol and they have the black idol say to the community, oh, no, no, no, this is racist and hope that we're going to sleeping, we're going to believe it. But we aren't anymore unfortunately.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, I think LeBron James is - he's a smart guy. And I think perhaps maybe the president should invite him to the White House and have a conversation.</p><p>OWENS: If that's too much for LeBron James, I would love to sit down with him and explain to him why the black community is responding -</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. He's a curious guy. He's a smart guy. He cares about the community. And I think all of this is a distraction. There's too much that we all have to do.</p><p>OWENS: Absolutely.</p><p>BRUCE: So, great job. Nice talking to you, Candace. All right.</p><p>OWENS: Thank you so much.</p><p>BRUCE: An NYU professor tried to challenge political correctness at his school and found himself targeted by the left. Now, he has a book about that experience. He's coming up next.</p><p>BRUCE: This is a Fox News alert. More results are coming in in a closely watched race in Ohio. It's special election for a congressional seat. Republican Troy Balderson is running against Democrat Danny O'Connor for the 12th district seat. Polls closed about 90 minutes ago. Fox will bring you the results of that race as soon as it is called.</p><p>It is time now for campus craziness. At the University of Minnesota, administrators are launching an assault on free speech as they are considering a new policy that could expel any student or fire any faculty member who uses the so-called wrong pronouns for other people. Experts say the policy will likely be unconstitutional, but that may not stop the left.</p><p>Michael Rectenwald is a professor at New York University. After he questioned himself the epidemic of political correctness on campus, he was attacked by his own school administration and later sued them for defamation. He now has a new book out called \"Springtime For Snowflakes.\"</p><p>Professor Rectenwald joins us right now. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>MICHAEL RECTENWALD, NYU PROFESSOR: Thanks for having me, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, you of all people know the nature of what's happening. You'd think, look, New York is a liberal city. NYU is the most liberal university.</p><p>With that, you would think all kinds of things are taught and freethinking is taught and the encouraging of ideas. But this dynamic of pronouns and firing people who don't use the right words, et cetera, this is not so far from what you would have expected considering your experience and what your book talks about as well.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Absolutely. What's happening there with the pronouns in Minnesota is perfectly consistent with what I have documented in this book. I don't call them liberals. I called them the illiberal left. And they are entirely in control of the university system throughout the entire country.</p><p>BRUCE: And this is where we have to worry because, of course, once you get out of high school, this is for many people, their first experiences of something beyond their home town with larger ideas and it really has become a conditioning, if you will.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Oh, yes.</p><p>BRUCE: It's like a conditioning camp. And then, we wonder why someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congressional candidate here as a democratic socialist, majored in economics, but didn't understand how unemployment works.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: So, we've got people coming out of college who don't understand the facts of the business, but they know to hate conservatives.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Yes. I mean, rigorous disciplines have been replaced by indoctrination, by social justice, ideological indoctrination in which it is not about whether you learn scientific or even other theoretical types of thinking. It is rather that you imbibe the correct Pablum on a regular basis.</p><p>And it's just a travesty.</p><p>BRUCE: With the exception of a few universities, this seems to be nationwide. It's not just NYU or other universities. How did it happen? I mean, you are there. You are standing up against it. We know that your fellow professors have not supported you, that everyone's quiet because you can lose a career. I mean, everything can be over.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Yes.</p><p>BRUCE: How are you faring at school and at work.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Well, I'm faring well just because I stand strong. They did move my office to the Russian department, which is quite interesting.</p><p>BRUCE: That's pretty funny actually.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Yes, it is.</p><p>BRUCE: They, at least, still have a sense of humor.</p><p>RECTENWALD: But where it came from is what I track in my book. And it comes from a long lineage of thinking, most of it post-modern theory, but also Maoist and Soviet techniques and disciplinary ideas.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, see, that's what's so ironic here is that American liberals, we stand against that.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: Because we stood against McCarthyism. It was, even if you have an idea that people don't like, then you can defeat it with a better idea.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Exactly.</p><p>BRUCE: That conversation has to happen.</p><p>RECTENWALD: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: And that's now effectively - it's being killed if it's not already killed in the American university system.</p><p>RECTENWALD: That's right. What they are doing now is that, if you have an idea they deem discursive violence, as they call it, they don't allow you to even voice it whatsoever. And so, they shut down alternative viewpoints.</p><p>This allows - with lack of competition in the realm of ideas, it allows the most outlandish things to pass off as legitimate discourse.</p><p>BRUCE: So, in your book, that becomes the issue. We know it's happened. What do parents do, what is the next step here? Are you suggesting something when it comes to defeating this or at least changing the side?</p><p>RECTENWALD: Yes, I do. I mean, my final conclusion is that social justice ideology is effectively a religion. And so, what we have is a religion being proffered as if it's neutral ideas and doctrines.</p><p>BRUCE: Right.</p><p>RECTENWALD: And so, what we have to do is fight it as a religion.</p><p>BRUCE: I've got to wrap it up, but people can get your book, \"Springtime For Snowflakes.\"</p><p>My name is Tammy Bruce. That's it. Thanks for joining us. Stay for election results throughout the night. Good night from New York. \"Hannity\" is next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018080701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T09-XTJ1-JB20-G2B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The Phoenix-based owner of a shoe-and-leather store wrote in a local newspaper he was \"amazed and a little dumbfounded\" by regulators'campaign to \"change how digital platforms operate.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The current system is working for small businesses, and as the old saying goes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" he wrote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Espinoza's words, published in September by the Arizona Capitol Times, weren't entirely his own. They were written on his behalf by an advocacy group that's backed by Google and other tech behemoths, reflecting Silicon Valley's stealthy new attempts to shape and weaponize public perception in response to heightened antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Under the withering microscope of government watchdogs, tech giants including Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have funded a bevy of political groups that have helped push positive polling and engaged in other fingerprint-free tactics designed to deter regulators who are seeking to break up or penalize the industry. The approach reflects the growing threats they now face from the Justice Department and the country's top attorneys general, who have been investigating them on antitrust grounds.</p><p>The Connected Commerce Council, for example, is a Washington-based nonprofit that bills itself as a voice for small businesses. But it counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as \"partners,\" and in recent months the group known as 3C has put its muscle to work arguing that Silicon Valley giants do not threaten competition, stifle smaller rivals and harm consumers in the process.</p><p>Espinoza, a boot-maker by profession, said he was approached by 3C last year after he participated in a Google seminar meant to help small businesses better use digital tools. The advocacy group then wrote the opinion piece largely on his behalf, which appeared online just days after state attorneys general announced their antitrust probe of the company. The opinion piece did not indicate that 3C largely penned it.</p><p>Espinoza said he still supported Google, whose technology, including its ad tools now under government investigation, have helped his company reach new customers across the country. But he also said he didn't know about Google's relationship with 3C, a group of which he is a member, before being contacted by The Post this week.</p><p>\"I'm not surprised,\" Espinoza said. Google is \"a big company ... and they have the finances to extend themselves as much as they can.\"</p><p>Jake Ward, the president of 3C, said his organization represents thousands of small businesses, not Silicon Valley's largest players. The organization often seeks to encourage corporate founders to share their views publicly, he added.</p><p>\"It is our responsibility, on behalf of our small-business members, to protect the existing model and promote the market, which is working exceedingly well,\" Ward said, later adding: \"We are not, and will not work for, Big Tech.\"</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Julie Tarallo McAlister, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement that the company supports \"a range of organizations like the Connected Commerce Council that are working to help small businesses grow and prosper online.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley tech giants - and companies across a range of industries - often back a wide array of advocacy groups to boost their political fortunes. They aren't required to disclose how much they spend on these organizations and exactly how involved they are in their dayto-day decisions, but ethics watchdogs say their participation alone is important.</p><p>\"It is an example of industry spending money and exerting influence, but doing it in a way that is meant to give the impression that it is not coming from industry,\" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group.</p><p>Bookbinder added: \"They wouldn't be members if they didn't agree with the thrust of what these organizations are pushing for.\"</p><p>The tech industry's attempts to shore up its public image in recent months reflects the seriousness of the U.S. government's new antitrust scrutiny. After years of threats, state and federal leaders have embarked on the kind of inquiries that could result in dramatic changes to the way Amazon, Facebook and Google operate, including punishments that could break apart those companies.</p><p>With Amazon, regulators are concerned that the e-commerce giant improperly gleans data from third-party sellers in an attempt to give its own products and services an advantage. In looking at Facebook, government officials have probed complaints it has gobbled up its digital rivals, leaving few viable competitors in social networking. And watchdogs have probed Google's search, advertising and smartphone businesses to determine whether they've stifled competition, following in the footsteps of European regulators who have already penalized the company.</p><p>All three tech giants deny they have violated state and federal antitrust rules. Still, Justice Department officials are expected to file a lawsuit against Google alleging it violated federal competition laws as soon as this month. Nearly every state's attorney general, meanwhile, could follow with their own complaint in July, The Post previously reported. The antitrust lawsuits come roughly seven years after U.S. officials first probed Google for violating competition law but ultimately decided against bringing a case in court.</p><p>With legal action imminent - and President Donald Trump recently taking fresh, aggressive aim at Silicon Valley - the industry's largest companies have shelled out sizable sums to lobby in Washington. Amazon, Facebook and Google have spent more than US$11 million combined over the first three months of 2020 to influence federal action on a range of issues, including antitrust, according to ethics disclosures filed with Congress. The amount is slightly higher than the same period in 2019.</p><p>But those figures do not reflect the hard-to-track sums spent by the industry to shape public opinion beyond the Beltway. Many in the tech industry privately say they've adopted such tactics because they face an onslaught of criticism from a wide array of new opposition groups, such as the Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit that has produced research critical of tech companies including Amazon and Google.</p><p>The group does not list its current backers, and it declined to detail them fully Tuesday. In the past it has courted Google's critics, including Oracle, though the campaign maintains it is not taking corporate contributions.</p><p>Facebook, for example, already has invested in a forthcoming advocacy group known as American Edge. The organization shares a similar structure to organizations such as the National Rifle Association, which blitzes airwaves with ads and doesn't have to disclose its donors.</p><p>The new tech group has sought to enlist support from other tech firms including Amazon and Google, according to two people familiar with the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. It is not clear if either firm intends to join.</p><p>The tech industry also has sought to funnel dollars to a wide array of conservative groups in recent years, hoping to earn more favour among Republicans in power at the White House and in Congress. That includes the National Taxpayers Union, a right-leaning outfit that typically targets government spending it sees as wasteful.</p><p>Last month, the NTU tapped a firm that previously polled for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to gauge voter sentiment about big tech. They focused their efforts on Arizona, Texas and other states that are actively investigating Google and other companies, and their findings concluded that voters would rather see their attorneys general focusing on other issues, including the opioid epidemic.</p><p>The survey explicitly asked if states should punish companies including Amazon and Google, which publicly have acknowledged their past financial support of the NTU. Pete Sepp, the president of the organization, declined to discuss the NTU's donors or the exact reasons it commissioned the poll, though he stressed that he and his organization have worked on competition-related issues for decades.</p><p>\"We have huge historical footprint in the antitrust issue space that transcends any tech firm and goes well before their founding,\" he said.</p><p>Such research - seeking to channel public sentiment - is a battle-tested tactic in antitrust probes, former regulators say. It's meant to \"press upon public officials, and indirectly upon agencies, that (companies) enjoy broad public support for what they're doing,\" said William Kovacic, a top professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the Federal Trade Commission. \"To tamper with them in a significant way is to anger the broader public.\"</p><p>Two years ago, the Connected Commerce Council launched as a voice for small businesses, and Ward, its leader, has grown the organization into an operation that represents more than 10,000 entrepreneurs. The group provides technical support, helping owners and employees use tech tools to place ads, manage their chequebooks and reach new customers online, he said.</p><p>The goal was to connect these smaller operators to larger companies, according to Ward, who found that \"policy and politics collided pretty quickly on what I was trying to do.\" In the end, he has found himself defending Amazon, Facebook and Google because it's better for the startups 3C represents, he said.</p><p>By September 2018, 3C members had sounded off in support of major tech companies during a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Trade Commission. 3C also helped produce opinion pieces, including the one published by Espinoza in 2019. Ward said the work is critical because regulators and readers otherwise never would hear from small businesses.</p><p>In more recent months, 3C has amped up its letter-writing campaigns, dispatching missives targeting Texas and other states now investigating large technology companies. Its letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in May, signed by 200 members, even said the state should not penalize Big Tech amid the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>\"During a pandemic, when many storefronts are shuttered and businesses that are still running are operating entirely online, it is the wrong time to demand changes in digital technology operations and business models,\" they said.</p><p>In doing so, however, Ward has stressed his organization's independence. \"We don't lobby on their behalf,\" he said. \"And we're not advocates for their larger positions.\"</p><p>The Washington Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Phoenix-based owner of a shoeand-leather store wrote in a local newspaper he was \"amazed and a little dumbfounded\" by regulators'campaign to \"change how digital platforms operate.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The current system is working for small businesses, and as the old saying goes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" he wrote.</p><p>But Espinoza's words, published in September by the Arizona Capitol Times, weren't entirely his own. They were written on his behalf by an advocacy group that's backed by Google and other tech behemoths, reflecting Silicon Valley's stealthy new attempts to shape and weaponize public perception in response to antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Under the withering microscope of government watchdogs, tech giants including Amazon.com Inc.,</p><p>Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have funded a bevy of political groups that have helped push positive polling and engaged in other fingerprint-free tactics designed to deter regulators who are seeking to break up or penalize the industry. The approach reflects the growing threats they now face from the Justice Department and the country's top attorneys general, who have been investigating them on antitrust grounds.</p><p>The Connected Commerce Council, for example, is a Washington-based non-profit that bills itself as a voice for small businesses. But it counts Amazon, Facebook and Google as \"partners,\" and in recent months the group known as 3C has put its muscle to work arguing that Silicon Valley giants do not threaten competition, stifle rivals and harm consumers in the process.</p><p>Espinoza, a boot-maker by profession, said he was approached by 3C last year after he participated in a Google seminar meant to help small businesses better use digital tools. The advocacy group then wrote the opinion piece largely on his behalf, which appeared online just days after state attorneys general announced their antitrust probe of the company. The opinion piece did not indicate that 3C largely penned it.</p><p>Espinoza said he still supported Google, whose technology, including its ad tools now under government investigation, have helped his company reach new customers across the country. But he also said he didn't know about Google's relationship with 3C, a group of which he is a member, before being contacted by The Post this week.</p><p>\"I'm not surprised,\" Espinoza said. Google is \"a big company ... and they have the finances to extend themselves as much as they can.\"</p><p>Jake Ward, the president of 3C, said his organization represents thousands of small businesses, not Silicon Valley's largest players. The organization often seeks to encourage corporate founders to share their views publicly, he added.</p><p>\"It is our responsibility, on behalf of our small-business members, to protect the existing model and promote the market, which is working exceedingly well,\" Ward said, later adding: \"We are not, and will not work for, Big Tech.\"</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Julie Tarallo McAlister, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement that the company supports \"a range of organizations like the Connected Commerce Council that are working to help small businesses grow and prosper online.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley tech giants - and companies across a range of industries - often back a wide array of advocacy groups to boost their political fortunes.</p><p>They aren't required to disclose how much they spend on these organizations and exactly how involved they are in their dayto-day decisions, but ethics watchdogs say their participation alone is important.</p><p>\"It is an example of industry spending money and exerting influence, but doing it in a way that is meant to give the impression that it is not coming from industry,\" said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group.</p><p>Bookbinder added: \"They wouldn't be members if they didn't agree with the thrust of what these organizations are pushing for.\"</p><p>The tech industry's attempts to shore up its public image in recent months reflects the seriousness of the U.S. government's new antitrust scrutiny. After years of threats, state and federal leaders have embarked on the kind of inquiries that could result in dramatic changes to the way Amazon, Facebook and Google operate, including punishments that could break apart those companies.</p><p>With Amazon, regulators are concerned that the e-commerce giant improperly gleans data from thirdparty sellers in an attempt to give its own products and services an advantage. In looking at Facebook, government officials have probed complaints it has gobbled up its digital rivals, leaving few viable competitors in social networking. And watchdogs have probed Google's search, advertising and smartphone businesses to determine whether they've stifled competition, following in the footsteps of European regulators who have already penalized the company.</p><p>All three tech giants deny they have violated state and federal antitrust rules. Still, Justice Department officials are expected to file a lawsuit against Google alleging it violated federal competition laws as soon as this month. Nearly every state's attorney general, meanwhile, could follow with their own complaint in July, The Post previously reported. The antitrust lawsuits come roughly seven years after U.S. officials first probed Google for violating competition law but ultimately decided against bringing a case in court.</p><p>The Washington Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Over the past year, the tech behemoth (and its parent company, Alphabet Inc.) has sustained some serious body blows. And more appear to be coming. Most recently, billionaire tech titan Peter Thiel (PayPal, Palantir Technologies, Clarium Capital, Founders Fund) grabbed headlines and shook markets by calling for an investigation by the FBI and CIA of Google for having \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\" Calls have been growing on both sides of the political aisle for the federal government to regulate, or even take over, the social media and search engine operations of Google and other Big Tech firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is some of the heavy pummeling Google has been receiving:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Senior Google engineer Dr. Greg Coppola, in a video interview, has accused Google and other Big Tech companies of \"taking sides in a political contest,\" which he characterized as \"dangerous.\" \"Are we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from now on?\" he asked.</p><p>* Dr. Robert Epstein, a leading technology-psychology scientist (and a Hillary Clinton supporter), testified to Congress that \"Google presents a serious threat to democracy and human autonomy,\" and presented extensive research to back his charges concerning Google's \"politically biased search results,\" \"massive surveillance,\" \"censorship,\" and \"voter manipulation.\"</p><p>* Google research scientist Jack Poulson quit the company in protest over its plans to go ahead with its secret Project Dragonfly, a search engine for Communist China that enables the regime to better censor, monitor, and surveil its citizens.</p><p>* More than 1,400 Google employees signed an internal petition calling on the company to end Dragonfly because the \"Chinese government is one of the worst human-rights abusers in the world today,\" and objecting to the transference of \"technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable.\"</p><p>* An alliance of more than a dozen human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Reporters Without Borders, called on Google to end Dragonfly.</p><p>* U.S. Vice President Mike Pence blasted Google and called on it to \"immediately end development of the 'Dragonfly' app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.\"</p><p>* Google recently lost its effort to dismiss the wrongful termination lawsuit of ex-Google engineer James Damore, who was fired in 2017, he says, because he was illegally discriminated against for being conservative, male, and Caucasian.</p><p>* A leaked 85-page Google briefing, entitled \"The Good Censor,\" admits that Google, Facebook, and Twitter now \"control the majority of online conversations\" and have adopted a \"shift towards censorship.\"</p><p>* In March of this year, Google was fined euro1.52 billion ($1.69 billion U.S.) by the European Union, bringing the total fines against the company in three separate cases to euro8.2 billion ($9.1 billion U.S.) for alleged illegal business practices. France also fined it euro50 million ($55.6 million U.S.) for data privacy violations.</p><p>The list goes on and on. While any combination of these punches might have proven fatal to many companies, GoogleAlphabet keeps rolling, seemingly unaffected and unrepentant. Its executives act as though their company's ginormous size grants them immunity and impunity to act as they will. Their arrogance is proof of Lord Acton's maxim that power corrupts. They do, after all, exemplify worldly power. Google is ubiquitous, its digital/ cultural footprint on the planet unmatched. Its very name has been turned into a verb and is invoked for searches, according to SEOtribunal.com, at least 63,000 times per second on any given day. That \"translates into at least 2 trillion searches per year, 3.8 million searches per minute, 228 million searches per hour, and 5.6 billion searches per day\" - and more than 90 percent of the search engine market share worldwide.</p><p>It also accounts for 75 percent of mobile browsing, 70 percent of desktop browsing, and along with Facebook, 50 percent of online ads.</p><p>What's more, notes SEO Tribunal, the Google-owned video giant YouTube \"is the second-largest search engine, right after Google. It's bigger than Bing, Yahoo!, and Ask combined,\" and has 1.9 billion users monthly.</p><p>As the planet's overwhelmingly dominant search engine, Google wields unparalleled power over everyone's access to information, from the trivial to the essential. However, even though it is best known for its search engine, Google (and its newer \"parent\" company, Alphabet) have expanded into entirely new fields: cloud computing (Google Drive), artificial intelligence (Deep Mind), browser (Google Chrome), smartphone (Google Pixel), Internet carrier (Google Fiber), mapping (Google Earth, Google Maps), language translation (Google Translate), and much more.</p><p>As we have reported in The New American previously, various studies have exposed Google's blatant political bias in the 2012 and 2016 U.S. presidential elections, where the search giant boosted Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, respectively, over Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, by giving tens of millions more links to the Democrat candidates.</p><p>Giving Conservatives the Boot</p><p>Since Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections, Big Tech globalists have been escalating their attacks on conservative news sites, websites, bloggers, and commentators. The weapons they are using are demonetizing, censoring, shadow banning, temporary suspension, and - when those measures fail to achieve the desired suppression of alternate viewpoints - outright banning, also known as \"deplatforming.\" Deplatforming is the preferred Big Tech weapon of the day, banishing troublesome \"thought-crime\" practitioners to the cyber netherworld. The big D-Day for initiating the deplatforming offensive was August 6, 2018, when YouTube joined with Apple, Facebook, and Spotify in sending all content by Alex Jones and his mega-popular Infowars down the Orwellian memory hole. Poof! In an instant, thousands of Infowars' videos, podcasts, and articles disappeared. The tech giants offered no proof of actual \"hate crimes\" to justify bouncing Jones - along with his 2.5 million subscribers - off his platform.</p><p>As The New American warned at the time, Big Tech's purge of Jones/Info wars was bound to be only the opening salvo in its Stalinist cyber jihad against all who refused to kowtow to political correctness. That has proven to be true, as a host of right-leaning victims has been slammed by GoogTwitFaceApp with demonetizing, censoring, and/or deplatforming: Paul Joseph Watson, Mike Adams and Natural News, Dennis Prager and Prager University, Can- dace Owens, Michelle Malkin, Steven Crowder, James Woods, Peter Van Buren, Tommy Robinson, Milo Yiannopoulos, Robert Spencer, Laura Loomer, Project Veritas, Gavin Mclnnes, The New American, and many more.</p><p>Insider In-fighting</p><p>Peter Thiel's charges against Google are especially provocative - and, potentially, the most damaging. Why? Because: a) As a fellow Silicon Valley titan, he has conspicuously broken ranks with the brotherhood of leftwing cyber billionaires that is boosting the \"progressive\" Democrats' political machine with funds and technical aid; b) He is Trump's most highprofile Big Tech supporter and presumably has close ties to the White House, and; c) He has dared to use the \"T\" word - treason - in connection with Google's business dealings with communist China.</p><p>The essence of Thiel's treason charge against Google was posed in the form _ of three questions to Google that the PayPal founder worked into his speech before the National Conservatism Conference on July 14.</p><p>According to Thiel, Google \"should be asked\":</p><p>\"Number one, how many foreign intelligence agencies have infiltrated your Manhattan Project for AI [artificial intelligence]?\";</p><p>\"Number two, does Google's senior management consider itself to have been thoroughly infiltrated by Chinese intelligence?\"</p><p>\"Number three, is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military ... because they are making the sert of bad, short-term rationalistic [decision] that if the technology doesn't go out the front door, it gets stolen out the backdoor anyway?\"</p><p>Thiel's remarks provided a strong accent to the many serious accusations about the growing intimacy between Google and Beijing leveled by the experts cited above, particularly as it relates to Project Dragonfly. His weighing in on this issue is particularly curious inasmuch as it runs completely contrary to what is otherwise the virtually unanimous love-struck narrative between Big Tech/ Big Money and Beijing, especially as exemplified by Thiel's fellow Bilderberg attendees. Thiel has become a regular at these annual high-powered, super-secret confabs of the globalist uber-elites, and Bilderbergers such as David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, and George Soros have been in the forefront of boosting China's military, economy, and technology for decades.</p><p>In his letter last August to the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, Google research scientist Jack Poulson charged that Dragonfly would, among other things, help track search-engine users, assist the communist censors, and help the regime's propagandists whitewash China's data on its abysmal air quality. \"Some of the most disturbing components of Project Dragonfly,\" wrote Coulson, \"which I here directly verify, include\":</p><p>* A prototype interface designed to allow a Chinese joint venture company to search for a given user's search queries based on their phone number.</p><p>* An extensive censorship blacklist developed in accordance with _ Chinese government demands. Among others, it contained the English term 'human rights', the Mandarin terms for 'student protest' and 'Nobel prize'....</p><p>* Explicit code to ensure only Chinese government-approved air quality data would be returned in response to Chinese users' search.</p><p>Poulson felt strongly enough about the matter to resign from Google in protest.</p><p>For its part, Google has tried to soothe concerns by claiming that its project with China was merely in the early exploration stage and not about to be realized in the near future. Google's Keith Enright told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on September 26 that \"we are not close to launching a product in China.\" Ben Gomes, Google's head of search, told the BBC last September: \"Right now all we've done is some exploration, but since we don't have any plans to launch something there's nothing much I can say about it.\"</p><p>However, that cover story was quickly shot full of holes. Whistleblowers at Google disturbed by the company's collaboration with China's dictators posted an internal memo expressing ethical concerns about participating in the program. According to Breitbart.com, one Google source characterized Gomes' comments to the BBC about Project Dragonfly as \"bull****.\" The Intercept reported that \"employees working on the censored search engine were instructed in late July, days before the project was publicly exposed, that they should prepare to get it into a 'launch-ready state' to roll out within weeks, pending approval from officials in Beijing.\"</p><p>In August of 2018, more than 1,400 Google employees signed an internal petition calling on the company to cease work on Dragonfly. When that failed to have effect, more than 500 employees signed a letter expressing their opposition to continued cooperation in the project.</p><p>\"Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be,\" the employees wrote. Dragonfly, they charged, \"would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.\"</p><p>The employees noted that Google's decision to proceed with Dragonfly \"comes as the Chinese government is cpenly expanding its surveillance powers and tools of population control.\" They further maintained, \"Providing the Chinese government with ready access to user data, as required by Chinese law, would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.\"</p><p>\"Dragonfly would also enable censorship and government-directed disinformation, and destabilize the ground truth on which popular deliberation and dissent rely,\" they continued.</p><p>Employee Rebuttal</p><p>In July, Project Veritas, which became famous with its hidden-camera videos exposing left-wing hypocrisy and criminality, opened a new phase in the speaking-truth-to-Google-power war with the release of a video interview with senior Google engineer Dr. Greg Coppola. Unlike Poulson, who resigned, and many other former Google employees, Dr. Coppola was a current employee at the time of the interview. (He has since been placed on administrative leave by Google.) And unlike current Google whistleblowers who only speak anonymously to avoid retaliation - Dr. Coppola sat down with Project Veritas' James O'Keefe for a calm but riveting on-camera, on-the-record interview.</p><p>In response to the repeated claims of Google executives that the company's search algorithms are unbiased and \"politically neutral,\" Coppola says: \"I have a Ph.D., I have five years' experience at Google and I just know how algorithms are. They don't write themselves. We write them to do what we want them to do.\"</p><p>\"I think we're just at a really important point in human history,\" Coppola said, adding, \"I think for a while we had tech that was politically neutral. Now we have tech that really, first of all is taking sides in a political contest, which I think, you know, anytime you have big corporate power merging with political parties can be dangerous.\" The Google scientist further averred that technology is being used to manipulate people, and warned, \"It's a time to decide, you know, do we run the technology, does the technology run us?\" He also asked, \"Are we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from now on?\"</p><p>Dr. Coppola called \"ridiculous\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai's December 2018 congressional testimony that Google's algorithms are politically unbiased. \"I report to Sundar, of course. And I have a great deal of respect for him as a manager,\" but, \"I think it's ridiculous to say that there's no bias. I think everyone who supports anything other than the Democrats, anyone who's pro-Trump or in any way deviates from what CNN and the New York Times are pushing, notices how bad it is.\" *</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2282775323</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYG-4H21-DY0W-40R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New American Aug 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol. 35</volume><issueNumber>No. 16</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 19, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The attorneys general said they expect more discussions on how state and federal authorities could tackle these issues.</p><p> \"The fact that there seems to be a more general consensus among states as well as clearly interest from the federal government probably does increase the likelihood of more activity from a regulatory oversight and investigative perspective from state AGs and perhaps from the federal government,\" Washington D.C.'s attorney general Karl Racine told USA TODAY.</p><p> The closed-door meeting came amid claims from President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and other Republicans that major companies such as Alphabet's Googleand Facebook suppress and censor conservative views that run counter to the left-leaning politics of Silicon Valley.</p><p> Sessions turns talk to bias charges</p><p> When the Justice Department announced the meeting earlier this month, it said it would discuss whether companies such as Alphabet's Googleand Facebook were harming competition and \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas.\"</p><p> Sessions opened Tuesday's meeting, which also included deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, by raising the issue of alleged ideological bias and sought twice to bring the conversation back to that topic of conservatives being suppressed or censored online, three state attorneys general told USA TODAY.</p><p> \"It seemed to me purpose of meeting was to push the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>idea that they are going to somehow drive political bias out of social media. I think that's stifling political speech and it's a dangerous business, and I said so in the meeting,\" Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh told USA TODAY. \"I asked if they had any evidence that the algorithms showed political bias and I asked what the theory was under antitrust law dealing with so called bias. Those questions were not answered.\"</p><p> State officials said they redirected the discussion to antitrust and privacy concerns. States have the authority to investigate anti-competitive conduct and deceptive practices by companies. It's unclear if they can regulate data handling under antitrust law. Topping the agenda: how companies collect users' private data and what they do with it.</p><p> \"Their power is unsurpassed in history,\" Mississippi's attorney general Jim Hood told USA Today.</p><p>Hood, who says he suggested a formal partnership between the state attorneys general and the federal government to pursue legal action against tech companies, drew parallels to previous interventions by the government such as the dominance of Standard Oil, the Justice Department's break-up of AT&amp;T's telephone monopoly and the antitrust actions against Microsoft.</p><p> \"We will get back together by telephone and see where go from here in the next six weeks ago,\" said Hood, one of Google's most outspoken critics who has gone after the company on ads for prescription drugs and other issues. \"It will take some time, probably decades of litigation, but we have to change their behavior particularly on privacy.\"</p><p>Utah's attorney general Sean Reyes said the meeting was \"part of a critical, ongoing dialogue on protecting consumers and competition in the technology sector without unnecessarily burdening innovation or investment.\"</p><p> \"We shared ideas and concerns about the impact of dominant market players on competition and how they may be unfairly leveraging their position for competitive advantage,\" Reyes said in a statement. \"We agreed that at the federal and state level, we are both seeking robust protection of consumers and markets through responsible regulation and disciplined enforcement.\"</p><p> The meeting was further evidence of the dramatic shift in fortunes for big tech in Washington. Criticism of their business practices has intensified with revelations that they failed to protect people's personal information and did too little to combat misinformation online during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p> \"Certainly that this meeting occurred and that the Attorney General of the United States invited AGs to really focus on the large platforms and tech companies and the manner in which they collect gather and utilize data, I think is significant,\" Racine said.</p><p> Some attorneys general are already pursuing big tech companies on their own.</p><p>Washington State's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is suing Facebook and Google, claiming they are not complying with state transparency laws for political advertising.</p><p>Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who's running for U.S. Senate on the Republican ticket, launched an antitrust investigation into whether Google manipulates search results to boost its own products and scrapes information from its rivals without permission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-f57e1125ba157cffc9b19c57c07c19fc953a8622</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5F6E919BEC NWBKPA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-THN1-DXVP-V43R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily American<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The attorneys general said they expect more discussions on how state and federal authorities could tackle these issues.</p><p> \"The fact that there seems to be a more general consensus among states as well as clearly interest from the federal government probably does increase the likelihood of more activity from a regulatory oversight and investigative perspective from state AGs and perhaps from the federal government,\" Washington D.C.'s attorney general Karl Racine told USA TODAY.</p><p> The closed-door meeting came amid claims from President Donald Trump and other Republicans that major companies such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook suppress and censor conservative views that run counter to the left-leaning politics of Silicon Valley.</p><p> Sessions turns talk to bias charges</p><p> When the Justice Department announced the meeting earlier this month, it said it would discuss whether companies such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook were harming competition and \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas.\"</p><p> Sessions opened Tuesday's meeting, which also included deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, by raising the issue of alleged ideological bias and sought twice to bring the conversation back to that topic of conservatives being suppressed or censored online, three state attorneys general told USA TODAY.</p><p> \"It seemed to me purpose of meeting was to push the Trump administration idea that they are going to somehow drive political bias out of social media. I think that's stifling political speech and it's a dangerous business, and I said so in the meeting,\" Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh told USA TODAY. \"I asked if they had any evidence that the algorithms showed political bias and I asked what the theory was under antitrust law dealing with so called bias. Those questions were not answered.\"</p><p> State officials said they redirected the discussion to antitrust and privacy concerns. States have the authority to investigate anti-competitive conduct and deceptive practices by companies. It's unclear if they can regulate data handling under antitrust law. Topping the agenda: how companies collect users' private data and what they do with it.</p><p> \"Their power is unsurpassed in history,\" Mississippi's attorney general Jim Hood told USA Today.</p><p>Hood, who says he suggested a formal partnership between the state attorneys general and the federal government to pursue legal action against tech companies, drew parallels to previous interventions by the government such as the dominance of Standard Oil, the Justice Department's break-up of AT&amp;T's telephone monopoly and the antitrust actions against Microsoft.</p><p> \"We will get back together by telephone and see where go from here in the next six weeks ago,\" said Hood, one of Google's most outspoken critics who has gone after the company on ads for prescription drugs and other issues. \"It will take some time, probably decades of litigation, but we have to change their behavior particularly on privacy.\"</p><p>Utah's attorney general Sean Reyes said the meeting was \"part of a critical, ongoing dialogue on protecting consumers and competition in the technology sector without unnecessarily burdening innovation or investment.\"</p><p> \"We shared ideas and concerns about the impact of dominant market players on competition and how they may be unfairly leveraging their position for competitive advantage,\" Reyes said in a statement. \"We agreed that at the federal and state level, we are both seeking robust protection of consumers and markets through responsible regulation and disciplined enforcement.\"</p><p> The meeting was further evidence of the dramatic shift in fortunes for big tech in Washington. Criticism of their business practices has intensified with revelations that they failed to protect people's personal information and did too little to combat misinformation online during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p> \"Certainly that this meeting occurred and that the Attorney General of the United States invited AGs to really focus on the large platforms and tech companies and the manner in which they collect gather and utilize data, I think is significant,\" Racine said.</p><p> Some attorneys general are already pursuing big tech companies on their own.</p><p>Washington State's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is suing Facebook and Google, claiming they are not complying with state transparency laws for political advertising.</p><p>Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who's running for U.S. Senate on the Republican ticket, launched an antitrust investigation into whether Google manipulates search results to boost its own products and scrapes information from its rivals without permission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-bbc82dbf212e854f61bdf871eb8eef49169d1ab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-M891-DXVP-V16R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It also contrasts with U.S. lawmakers'slower approach to the issue, as they start discussing how to keep in check the growing power of the tech industry's titans.</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said she's taking a \"very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer.\"</p><p>In addition to selling its own products, Amazon allows third-party retailers to sell their goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from third-party sellers.</p><p>In doing so, Amazon collects data about activity on its platform that, the EU says, it might be able to use to favor its own products for sale. In particular, the EU will look at how Amazon determines which trader is selected as the default seller of an item that a customer wants to buy.</p><p>The EU opened a preliminary probe into the issue last year, and Vestager said it has shown that \"Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information - about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\"</p><p>The investigation could lead to fines and eventually cause Amazon to change the way it works. Previous EU antitrust cases have resulted in such change, though it is unclear how big their ultimate impact has been in addressing the EU's concerns. For example, Google had to tweak the display of search results, which the EU had said favored Google goods and services.</p><p>Amazon said it \"will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\"</p><p>In a parallel but separate case, Germany's competition regulator said Wednesday that Amazon was changing some of its business conditions for traders on its online marketplace worldwide after the regulator raised concerns about some terms. The case is not like the EU's probe about data on traders, but about contractual terms such as a one-sided exemption from liability to Amazon's benefit as well as the place of jurisdiction for disputes.</p><p>Other EU countries like Austria, Luxembourg and Italy are also independently investigating Amazon but EU spokeswoman Lucia Caudet said the national probes did not overlap with the EU investigation.</p><p>The EU's investigations into major companies like Amazon have led the way in a global push to more tightly regulate tech giants, as many governments wonder if they are becoming too big for the good of the wider economy.</p><p>Among the key questions are not only whether the tech giants abuse their market dominance to choke off competition, potentially stifling choice for consumers and innovation, but also whether they are adequately protecting users'data and paying their fair share of taxes in countries where they operate.</p><p>U.S. authorities have started to follow Europe's lead in taking a closer look at the big tech companies, particularly after the scandal in which Facebook was found to have allowed data on millions of people to be used by other companies, including to try to influence the 2016 election that made Donald Trump president. According to published reports, U.S. regulators are poised to fine Facebook $5 billion for that scandal, but the wider debate of reining in tech companies' powers has only just begun.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee in the U.S. is investigating the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress is this week holding a two-day hearing on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency, Libra, which governments in the U.S. and Europe have been skeptical about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0097877711</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-PRV1-JBM5-R2NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook places restrictions on the use of logos, banners and advertising inserted into videos.</p><p>The inability to effectively monetise content on digital platforms, which benefit greatly from content created by local and international media and entertainment companies, has been one of the key issues raised in the ACCC's 19-month inquiry.</p><p>Free TV strongly backs the government implementing the ACCC's recommendation to set up a code of conduct which would require companies like Facebook and Google to negotiate arrangements regarding revenue and data sharing.</p><p>However, Free TV said it would prefer the ACCC govern the code. The competition watchdog has recommended the Australian Communications and Media Authority overlook a code.</p><p>Free TV said the code should include provisions around remuneration deals, information shares between media businesses and the tech giants, flexibility around the display and monetisation of content and dispute resolution.</p><p>Both Facebook and Google have slammed the proposal. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/facebook-says-we-re-really-not-that-big-20190913-p52qyt\">Facebook argued in its submission there is no imbalance of bargaining power</url> with Australian media companies and claimed it is not an essential gateway for Australians accessing news and information.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/google-claims-it-offers-billions-of-clicks-hits-back-at-accc-20190917-p52s7d\">Google argued the proposal overlooked more than three billion referrals</url> the search giant sends Australian publishers' way every year.</p><p>\"Due to the restrictive nature of the rules stipulated by Facebook and Google, the content owner is given insufficient control over the content that they have created and which they are seeking to monetise,\" the submission said.</p><p>\"In effect, this means that Australian content is being undervalued and sold at a discount on digital platforms.\"</p><p>Free TV represents Nine, Seven West Media, the Ten Network, Prime Media, WIN Corp, Southern Cross Austereo and Imparja Television. Nine owns The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>The lobby said broadcasters find inconsistency and a lack of transparency around when and to whom advertising is served to along with their content.</p><p>\"As the digital platforms rely on the investment by others in content, they tend to be merely interested in achieving volume of ad sales or, in the case of news aggregation sites, extracting greater insight into users to better target ads, regardless of the provenance or public benefit value to the Australian society that the content may provide.\"</p><p>In early August, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/facebook-watch-inks-video-deal-with-local-broadcasters-20190802-p52d69\">Facebook signed 12-month deal</url>s with Nine, Seven, Ten, Sky News, Junkee and Pedestrian.TV to create a series of original news and current affairs shows for its video service Facebook Watch.</p><p>\"However, it must be recognised that the recent limited content deals with Facebook do not address the long-term sustainable monetisation of premium Australian content on their platform,\" Free TV said.</p><p>As a result, these recent announcements should be viewed as a welcome accompaniment (but not a replacement for) the need for a new commercial relationship between media companies and the platforms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520183633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-CW81-JBJ7-N2NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>07:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Before describing the angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin arguments of these lawyers let's sketch the complex setting in which all this is playing out.</p><p>The Current System. All of this involves the interactions between two foreign worker programs with different rules, and based on different governmental decision-making structures.</p><p>The older and larger of the two programs, set up by Congress, is the H-1B program for skilled workers, mostly college grads, and mostly employed in Big Tech.</p><p>There are something like 900,000 of these workers, and they and their employers like the rest of us pay the usual payroll taxes. The visas are granted for an initial three-year period, and are often extended for many more three-year periods. There is a ceiling of 85,000 new visas a year in this program, but an unlimited number of renewals. It is very controversial because of the negative impact on jobs for citizens and green card holders.</p><p>There are substantial fees paid by employers in the H-1B program, which there are not in OPT; further the H-1B fees are much larger for firms, such as the big Indian outsourcing companies, that hire mostly H-1B workers, and lower for those hiring smaller percentages of them. The former are sometimes called 50/50 companies, as they have more than 50 employees and more than 50 percent of them are H-1Bs; the legal term is \"H-1B dependent\".</p><p>The newer and smaller of the programs is Optional Practical Training, which was dreamed up during the Bush II administration, expanded by the Obamas, and preserved by the Trumps. It has no congressional authorization and could be repealed by the stroke of a pen.</p><p>There are about 300,000 workers in it (with the government pretending they are \"students\" when they are really alumni and full-time workers.) The work permits in this program are relatively short term: one year for all new alien college grads from U.S. colleges and universities, and a total of three years for those former foreign students with degrees in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math).</p><p>OPT workers and their employers are both excused from the normal payroll taxes, which support our aging and elderly through the Social Security, Medicare, and Federal-State Unemployment Insurance programs. While the OPT work permits are for limited periods of time, there are no ceilings on the number of them, and they have more than doubled in recent years.</p><p>Links Between the Two Programs. OPT was created to: 1) expand the number of foreign workers in the United States without a congressional mandate; and 2) ease the process by which alien grads of U.S. colleges can move from student to H-1B status. Since there was usually an apparent over-subscription to the H-1B program, foreign students in U.S. colleges often could not move immediately from the status of genuine student to that of an H-1B worker. In many cases they had to return to their homes (usually in Asia) before getting hired as an H-1B.</p><p>Following the establishment of OPT, there was a new, industry-friendly, intermediate step in the process, that of OPT worker. The usual sequence is now: First, the alien's graduation, next on to OPT status, and then on to H-1B status; thus meaning that the recent alien grad did not need to leave the country prior to becoming an H-1B. OPT, in a word, made it easier for employers to use the H-1B program, and thus to deny jobs to U.S. workers.</p><p>The Court Case. The lawyers for Big Tech have focused on one small part of the complex system just described. In a filing in the federal court for the District of Columbia, they have sought to eliminate the $4,000 H-1B fee for H-1B workers who adjust their status (from OPT, for instance) to that of H-1B while remaining in the United States. They want something on the order of $350 million to be refunded to the 50/50 employers, which is what they say was improperly charged to them over the last six years.</p><p>Their angels-on-a-pin argument relates to a distinction they draw between those adjusting to H-1B status while in the United States and the admission of H-1B workers from abroad. They say that Congress meant only the admissions to produce fees at this level, and that adjustments were to have much smaller fees.</p><p>That an admission and an adjustment both add equally to the population of foreign workers, and that hundreds of thousands of jobs are taken from citizens (and green card holders) whichever arrival technique is used, is apparently of no concern. Their pitch pertains not to social policy, but to their own view of the legal definition of adjustment, a view that would cost DHS more than a third of a billion dollars.</p><p>The Kicker. I am not a lawyer and cannot make a prediction of what the judiciary will do on this fine point, but I can suggest a possible unintended consequence of Big Tech's winning this one, if they do.</p><p>DHS, which has done nothing about the OPT program since January 2017, might look at the program in a different light. Suddenly, DHS has an unexpected bill of a third of a billion dollars that it must pay; plus a continuing loss of $60 million a year. (I get the latter figure by dividing $350 million by six and rounding.) The continuing impact of these massive costs, however, could be contained were DHS to curtail OPT.</p><p>You see, if the OPT program were abolished, virtually all the arrivals of H-1B workers would be admissions from abroad, all to be paid at the higher rate. And DHS has total control of OPT; it could reduce it or kill it completely by issuing a new regulation.</p><p>If DHS decided, against its own institutional financial interest, to continue OPT at its current size some 300,000 jobs taken from U.S. college grads every year it would not only mean 300,000 jobs lost to citizens at a cost of $3 billion or so a year to America's elderly and afflicted (through losses to the Medicare, Social Security, and Federal-State Unemployment Insurance trust funds), it would also take away $60 million each year from DHS' own funds that could be used to finance the more careful administration of the immigration law!</p><p>So if Big Tech's lawyers win the case, and if DHS reacts to end or diminish OPT, it might turn out, in soccer terminology, to be an \"own goal\" of monumental dimensions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123455748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3H-C041-DYTH-G0X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1204\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This question must interest all those with an interest in antitrust.</p><p>\"A key challenge posed by such cases in digital markets relates to assessing what may be a small possibility of a large reduction in competition,\" he will add.</p><p>Mr Sims will hand his final report on digital platforms to the government at the end of June.</p><p>The conference will also hear papers from former High Court judge Dyson Heydon, on liability under the competition law and Federal Court Justice Michael Wigney on substantially lessening competition under the abuse of market power provisions in the law.</p><p>Federal Court Justice Lindsay Foster will speak about cartel cases along with Luke Woodward from Gilbert &amp; Tobin.</p><p>Mr Sims will stress it is important not to use the competition laws to try to solve privacy and other issues raised by the platforms.</p><p>\"Widening the objectives of competition law is likely to reduce its effectiveness,\" he will say. \"A broader perspective must be brought to bear by considering the effectiveness of consumer protection laws and privacy laws and regulations.\" On the TPG case, Mr Sims will say \"we should never confuse rational pricing with the consumer interest. Consumers need the benefits of vigorous competition in order to obtain competitive pricing and the innovation that is in their interests\".</p><p>\"We need to also recognise that Australians pay more for mobile communication services than many other countries we like to compare ourselves with.</p><p>\"There are more debates to come as we reflect on the economic harm associated with concentrated markets,\" Mr Sims will say.COMMENTARY P24</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-9bb938547df611e98296824fa12c8c6c70fca3a50c3d33c7d93569b5b03ad890</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W60-JHS1-JD3N-51SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 25, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I am of that sandwiched generation who grew up with pens, typewriters and the indentation of the tip of the index finger that came from phone dialling. Then we adapted to PCs and smartphones and have been inclined towards gratitude for the way our lives were made easier and more inter-esting by the work of the Silicon Valley techies. That gratitude, however, is dying with us; the cursors turning to curses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Noam Cohen's book is a competent, slightly humourless concoction - half polemic, half potted biographies of the big figures of Big Tech. Most significantly it is a not untypical representative of the mood of disenchantment. For him, Bill Gates and Larry Page are the Andrew Carnegies and JP Morgans of the millennial cusp - lawless robber barons who fix the terms of trade to suit themselves, then preen around giving money to charity and proclaiming their own virtues.</p><p>\"These Silicon Valley leaders,\" he writes, \"propose a society in which personal freedoms are near absolute and government regulations wither away, where bold entrepreneurs amass billions of dollars from their innovations and the rest of us struggle in a hypercompetitive market without unions, government regulations, or social welfare programs to protect us.\"</p><p>The good old world is destroyed. \"Local stores, local newspapers, local unions, local political organisations are swept away as tech companies centralise profits.\" The small, intimate collective life (albeit governmentally regulated) of the prelapsarian world is flooded by their infernal devices, which by some semi-hypnotic power force us to buy them, use them and replace other things with them, despite ourselves.</p><p>Cohen has written on tech for, among others, The New York Times and knows something of the field. But if he is aware of the history of disruption (ie the history of human development) he doesn't acknowledge it. For Big Tech read Big Pharma, supermarket chains, the automobile, the railways, bankers, printing, Rupert Murdoch, cable TV, movies, novels and agriculture. Each and all of them has been accused of subverting the more natural and more local (and inevitably more hierarchical) order of things.</p><p>Today the cycle of disenchantment is ever quicker. It took us some time to get cross with Google for making so much money out of advertising to us, less to become angry with Facebook for exploiting our personal information, and almost none at all to go from regarding Uber and Airbnb as modern miracles to seeing them as sinks of exploitation.</p><p>According to Cohen, the Australopithecus of the evolutionary strain that led to Silicon Man and thence to Uber was developed in the postwar labs and offices of Stanford University in California. Situated in what became Silicon Valley, Stanford was a poor relation to the Ivy League schools, and to survive created a new model of entrepreneurial research. Its dean of engineering, the creator of Stanford Industrial Park and finally provost until 1965, was Frederick Terman. He sought out and procured some of the leading talents in emerging technologies and encouraged a model whereby they could develop and profit from the innovations their work created.</p><p>Just a generation ago the practical (and profitable) application of university research to industry was considered something of a grail. And Stanford was a model for it. Cohen invites us to see this joining of academia and enterprise as a grisly mixed marriage that brought forth the mutant that is ruining our world. From outside it is hard not to see it rather as an enlightened strategy that placed the US in the forefront of the technologies that have transformed the past three decades.</p><p>The once-heroes now antiheroes of Silicon Valley each get their shortish chapters.</p><p>Gates of Microsoft is here, as are Marc Andreessen of Netscape, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, Peter Thiel of Paypal, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. They're all men, they're all white, they're all rich and, as far as Cohen is concerned, they're all the same. So the politics of the one Donald Trump supporter, Thiel (who is a conflicted libertarian), is held to represent the logical destination of all of them, even though most opposed Trump.</p><p>The most interesting chapter for me is the one on John McCarthy, the originator of the term \"artificial intelligence\". McCarthy was the son of American communists, both of whom worked for the party paper, the Daily Worker. At 17 he was an activist, but at the height of the Cold War drifted out of politics and dedicated himself to the new science of computing. He was one of the people poached by Terman to go to Stanford, where he helped to set up the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1965.</p><p>Told by Cohen, McCarthy's journey is just another (and regrettable) drift from the left of his youth to the right of his senescence. And despite his many innovations and accurate predictions of the shape of the world to come, McCarthy's main significance for Cohen lies in his reaction to one incident that took place in 1989.</p><p>It was then that McCarthy successfully argued against taking down one of the new internet forums hosted, but not run by Stanford - rec.humor.funny - on the basis that it carried racist and offensive jokes. McCarthy's view was that the internet needed to be a place where free expression was allowed at all times.</p><p>Cohen believes that McCarthy's campaign was the origin of what Cohen sees as a terrible flaw. He writes: \"Either you accepted offensive speech online or you were in favour of burning books. There would be no middle ground permitted, and thus no opportunity to introduce reasonable regulations to ensure civility online, which is our predicament today.\" Following McCarthy's dictum means that Facebook and Twitter have \"encouraged the public to stew in their own hateful juices and profited handsomely in the process\".</p><p>It's ironic that a journalist such as Cohen should regard a commitment to freedom of expression as an essentially right-wing characteristic. McCarthy, of course, coming from a communist background, may have sensed more accurately the dangers involved in restricting what people could say on what would become the great universal platform. McCarthy may have read Orwell.</p><p>The problem is that the \"middle ground\" suggested by Cohen requires someone to decide what it is and to police it. It needs a censor. And why go to the trouble of burning books if you can use an algorithm to expunge certain kinds of expression? I don't mean that Cohen is always wrong. Big money often means big arrogance and needs big oversight. But his alternative nirvana of a lovely big, diverse, chaotic Gormenghast of an internet, all free and yet somehow all regulated, with only good things happening and sin somehow filtered out by the actions of volunteer curators, is chimerical. Like all utopias, in practice we wouldn't like it when we got there.</p><p>Facebook and Twitter 'have encouraged the public to stew in their own hateful juices'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>taken for a ride Protests in Madrid against Uber, a service initially seen as a modern miracle, now fighting exploitation claims</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-133502329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RD5-1N91-JBVM-Y19W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 13, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp;

I am of that sandwiched generation who grew up with pens, typewriters and the indentation of the tip of the index finger that came from phone dialling. Then we adapted to PCs and smartphones and have been inclined towards gratitude for the way our lives were made easier and more inter-esting by the work of the Silicon Valley techies. That gratitude, however, is dying with us; the cursors turning to curses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Noam Cohen's book is a competent, slightly humourless concoction - half polemic, half potted biographies of the big figures of Big Tech. Most significantly it is a not untypical representative of the mood of disenchantment. For him, Bill Gates and Larry Page are the Andrew Carnegies and JP Morgans of the millennial cusp - lawless robber barons who fix the terms of trade to suit themselves, then preen around giving money to charity and proclaiming their own virtues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"These Silicon Valley leaders,\" he writes, \"propose a society in which personal freedoms are near absolute and government regulations wither away, where bold entrepreneurs amass billions of dollars from their innovations and the rest of us struggle in a hypercompetitive market without unions, government regulations, or social welfare programs to protect us.\"</p><p>The good old world is destroyed. \"Local stores, local newspapers, local unions, local political organisations are swept away as tech companies centralise profits.\" The small, intimate collective life (albeit governmentally regulated) of the prelapsarian world is flooded by their infernal devices, which by some semi-hypnotic power force us to buy them, use them and replace other things with them, despite ourselves.</p><p>Cohen has written on tech for, among others, The New York Times and knows something of the field. But if he is aware of the history of disruption (ie the history of human development) he doesn't acknowledge it. For Big Tech read Big Pharma, supermarket chains, the automobile, the railways, bankers, printing, Rupert Murdoch, cable TV, movies, novels and agriculture. Each and all of them has been accused of subverting the more natural and more local (and inevitably more hierarchical) order of things.</p><p>Today the cycle of disenchantment is ever quicker. It took us some time to get cross with Google for making so much money out of advertising to us, less to become angry with Facebook for exploiting our personal information, and almost none at all to go from regarding Uber and Airbnb as modern miracles to seeing them as sinks of exploitation.</p><p>According to Cohen, the Australopithecus of the evolutionary strain that led to Silicon Man and thence to Uber was developed in the postwar labs and offices of Stanford University in California. Situated in what became Silicon Valley, Stanford was a poor relation to the Ivy League schools, and to survive created a new model of entrepreneurial research. Its dean of engineering, the creator of Stanford Industrial Park and finally provost until 1965, was Frederick Terman. He sought out and procured some of the leading talents in emerging technologies and encouraged a model whereby they could develop and profit from the innovations their work created.</p><p>Just a generation ago the practical (and profitable) application of university research to industry was considered something of a grail. And Stanford was a model for it. Cohen invites us to see this joining of academia and enterprise as a grisly mixed marriage that brought forth the mutant that is ruining our world. From outside it is hard not to see it rather as an enlightened strategy that placed the US in the forefront of the technologies that have transformed the past three decades.</p><p>The once-heroes now antiheroes of Silicon Valley each get their shortish chapters. Gates of Microsoft is here, as are Marc Andreessen of Netscape, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, Peter Thiel of Paypal, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. They're all men, they're all white, they're all rich and, as far as Cohen is concerned, they're all the same. So the politics of the one Donald Trump supporter, Thiel (who is a conflicted libertarian), is held to represent the logical destination of all of them, even though most opposed Trump.</p><p>The most interesting chapter for me is the one on John McCarthy, the originator of the term \"artificial intelligence\". McCarthy was the son of American communists, both of whom worked for the party paper, the Daily Worker. At 17 he was an activist, but at the height of the Cold War drifted out of politics and dedicated himself to the new science of computing. He was one of the people poached by Terman to go to Stanford, where he helped to set up the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1965.</p><p>Told by Cohen, McCarthy's journey is just another (and regrettable) drift from the left of his youth to the right of his senescence. And despite his many innovations and accurate predictions of the shape of the world to come, McCarthy's main significance for Cohen lies in his reaction to one incident that took place in 1989.</p><p>It was then that McCarthy successfully argued against taking down one of the new internet forums hosted, but not run by Stanford - rec.humor.funny - on the basis that it carried racist and offensive jokes. McCarthy's view was that the internet needed to be a place where free expression was allowed at all times.</p><p>Cohen believes that McCarthy's campaign was the origin of what Cohen sees as a terrible flaw. He writes: \"Either you accepted offensive speech online or you were in favour of burning books. There would be no middle ground permitted, and thus no opportunity to introduce reasonable regulations to ensure civility online, which is our predicament today.\" Following McCarthy's dictum means that Facebook and Twitter have \"encouraged the public to stew in their own hateful juices and profited handsomely in the process\".</p><p>It's ironic that a journalist such as Cohen should regard a commitment to freedom of expression as an essentially right-wing characteristic. McCarthy, of course, coming from a communist background, may have sensed more accurately the dangers involved in restricting what people could say on what would become the great universal platform. McCarthy may have read Orwell.</p><p>The problem is that the \"middle ground\" suggested by Cohen requires someone to decide what it is and to police it. It needs a censor. And why go to the trouble of burning books if you can use an algorithm to expunge certain kinds of expression? I don't mean that Cohen is always wrong. Big money often means big arrogance and needs big oversight. But his alternative nirvana of a lovely big, diverse, chaotic Gormenghast of an internet, all free and yet somehow all regulated, with only good things happening and sin somehow filtered out by the actions of volunteer curators, is chimerical. Like all utopias, in practice we wouldn't like it when we got there.</p><p>The Know-It-Alls The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball by Noam Cohen</p><p>Oneworld, 272pp;

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">sign up here</url> to receive it weekdays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A growing share of Americans are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">concerned about the environment</url>, and the big U.S. tech companies would seem to be in a position to lead the way on fighting climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They\u2019re rich and staffed with smart people, and they have generally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">pledged to do more to reduce the carbon emissions</url> that warm the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Somini Sengupta</url>, who writes about climate change and used to cover the tech industry, walked me through confusing climate change terms and how tech companies and all of us can help slow global warming.</p><p>Shira: What does it mean when a company pledges to go \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">carbon neutral</url>\u201d or \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">carbon negative</url>?\u201d</p><p>Somini: A company will still produce carbon emissions, but it will offset that by doing things that absorb emissions from the atmosphere \u2014 like planting forests. Trees are great! They absorb carbon dioxide. At least some portion of Amazon\u2019s and Apple\u2019s climate action plans involve reforestation.</p><p>But that\u2019s not enough. Climate scientists say global emissions must be cut by half by 2030 if we stand a chance of averting the worst impacts of warming.</p><p>How do tech companies contribute to climate change, and how are they helping?</p><p>First, the industry uses lots of electricity, including for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">computer data centers</url>. If much of that comes from coal, it creates a boatload of planet-warming emissions. This is a relatively easy problem to solve if companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">use renewable energy</url>, which is expanding fast and getting cheaper.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Amazon</url>, Google and Microsoft have also gotten <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">attention</url> for selling technology to help the oil and gas industry extract fossil fuels, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">promised to stop</url>.</p><p>Other areas to watch: Can Apple, Amazon and Google compel manufacturers of their devices to reduce factory emissions and switch to cleaner energy?

The story is told in alternating sections labeled \u201cBefore\u201d and \u201cAfter.\u201d In the former, anarchist hackers unravel the web that holds us all; in the latter, they deal with the consequences of succeeding beyond their wildest dreams.</p><p>While depicting many all-too-plausible extensions of control and surveillance technology, Maughan suggests that it\u2019s impossible to take a simple stand for or against the machines with which our ways of life are already fused.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">\u201cFeed\u201d</url> by M.T.

However, a break-up of today's dominant online platforms seems unlikely, he suggested.</p><p>Speaking in an interview this week, Mr Smith, who joined Microsoft in 1993, predicted a return to a period when government set broad rules governing how particular industry sectors operate, rather than focusing on individual cases of economic harm caused by monopolists.</p><p>The shift reflects the wide range of concerns stirred up by today's leading consumer tech companies, including privacy and the mass collection of data. Also, the fact that a number of different companies are involved, rather than a single dominant monopolist, makes broader action likely, he suggested. 'It won't surprise me if we see more focus in Brussels, and perhaps even in Washington, on that set of issues and not one thing alone,' Mr Smith said.</p><p>Changes in the way regulators think about competition are also reshaping the response to tech's market power, he added, with 'new schools of antitrust thinking' taking hold. That is leading to broader theories of potential harm, not just those to do with limiting competition or pushing up prices for consumers.</p><p>'You can't help but note that the year 2019 is significant in that Berlin and Washington have both embraced a similar approach to some degree, arguing that it is appropriate to consider more of these so-called non-economic, non-price issues - and that's unusual,' he said.</p><p>The widening interest of the regulators was on display in Washington on Tuesday, when top US competition regulators answered questions before the Senate judiciary committee.

However, a break-up of today\u2019s dominant online platforms seems unlikely, he suggested.</p><p>Speaking in an interview this week, Mr Smith, who joined Microsoft in 1993, predicted a return to a period when government set broad rules governing how particular industry sectors operate, rather than focusing on individual cases of economic harm caused by monopolists.</p><p>The shift reflects the wide range of concerns stirred up by today\u2019s leading consumer tech companies, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7ad35887-16c2-4d9f-8468-3a7afd5933d6\"> privacy and the mass collection of data</url>. Also, the fact that a number of different companies are involved, rather than a single dominant monopolist, makes broader action likely, he suggested. \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise me if we see more focus in Brussels, and perhaps even in Washington, on that set of issues and not one thing alone,\u201d Mr Smith said.</p><p>Changes in the way regulators think about competition are also reshaping the response to tech\u2019s market power, he added, with \u201cnew schools of antitrust thinking\u201d taking hold. That is leading to broader theories of potential harm, not just those to do with limiting competition or pushing up prices for consumers.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help but note that the year 2019 is significant in that Berlin and Washington have both embraced a similar approach to some degree, arguing that it is appropriate to consider more of these so-called non-economic, non-price issues \u2014 and that\u2019s unusual,\u201d he said.</p><p>The widening interest of the regulators was on display in Washington on Tuesday, when top US competition regulators answered questions before the Senate judiciary committee. Makan Delrahim, head of the Department of Justice antitrust division, said allegations of political bias against companies like Google and Facebook were likely to be taken into account in any assessment of the companies\u2019 market power.</p><p>Mr Smith took over as Microsoft\u2019s top lawyer at the height of its battle with the justice department and the European Commission nearly two decades ago and was instrumental in shaping a response that eventually saw it escape close regulatory scrutiny. The software company rebounded to overtake Apple and become the world\u2019s most valuable company again earlier this year, after repositioning its business away from its old PC monopoly.</p><p>In contrast to Microsoft\u2019s dominance during the PC era, Mr Smith pointed to new features of today\u2019s tech landscape that had drawn more pointed questions. These include the rise of online marketplaces run by the dominant tech platforms, and the dependence of some companies on digital advertising.</p><p>The tech landscape is \u201csomewhat different today, in that some of the platforms are both platforms and aggregators,\u201d he said. That includes Apple\u2019s App store and Amazon\u2019s marketplace for other online sellers. \u201cWindows, for all its market share and economic position, never had an app store,\u201d Mr Smith said.</p><p>Acting as both open platform and marketplace had \u201cstrengthened\u201d their position, making other providers of digital content \u2014 and even companies selling physical goods \u2014 dependent on \u201ctwo-sided markets\u201d run by the biggest tech companies, he said.</p><p>Fears about the conflicts of interest caused by this dual role have led politicians like Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren to call for a break-up of the big tech companies.</p><p>However, Mr Smith suggested that the worries were lessened by the fact that there are a number of rival online venues. \u201cThere are more platforms today\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009That means no single platform has the role in technology that perhaps the Windows platform played two decades ago,\u201d he said.</p><p>In a new book addressing the biggest tech policy issues, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tools and Weapons</emphasis>, Mr Smith and co-author Carol Ann Browne also highlighted the impact of online advertising, comparing concerns about today\u2019s advertising-dependent internet giants to the backlash against radio in the 1940s. Back then, a move into advertising was accused of changing the nature of the medium and \u201cdumbing down\u201d programming.</p><p>\u201cThe issues today are less about that and more about whether it\u2019s engendering sort of algorithmically based cyber-tribes,\u201d Mr Smith said. \u201cThese issues do have real precedents \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising people are looking around and asking these questions.\u201d</p><p>Microsoft itself faced a court-ordered break-up during its battle with the Department of Justice nearly two decades ago, before the order was overturned on appeal. Based on the software company\u2019s long run-in with regulators, Mr Smith said, \u201cthey certainly don\u2019t require that the companies be broken up or even that their products be divided up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUltimately, it was less about breaking things apart and more about putting rules in place to ensure that the creator of the platform couldn\u2019t obtain inappropriate benefit in a market or for a product that was considered adjacent,\u201d he added. \u201cIt shows that the process is slow but the tools are plentiful in terms of what competition regulators have.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-1c0fb100da1711e98f9b77216ebe1f17</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X33-9651-JB77-K182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
