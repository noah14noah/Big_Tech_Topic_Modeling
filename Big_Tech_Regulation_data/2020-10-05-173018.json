Anonymous TikTok users told The Jerusalem Post that their Jewish heritage has been attacked on the platform. One Jewish TikToker told The Post she began seeing calls to \u201cbring back the Holocaust\u201d and said death threats have nearly become a daily occurrence.    Another Jewish TikToker, who wished to remain anonymous over fear of retribution told The Post that she \u201cwasn\u2019t posting anything about being Jewish or Israeli.\u201d But because she had an Israeli flag in her bio, she said she received a barrage of increasingly hateful comments. At one point, other users even threatened to reach out to one of her former employers. The Post reported that someone had found the Jewish TikToker\u2019s personal information, \u201cand the thought that users might figure out where she lives still makes her uneasy.\u201d    Still another Jewish TikToker said she suspected that she was harassed for wearing a Star of David necklace in her videos and because she \u201chad a Star of David emoji in her profile,\u201d reported The Post .     TikTok guidelines about hate speech state that any language intending to \u201cattack, threaten, incite violence against, or dehumanize\u201d an individual or group of individuals on the basis of protected attributes, such as religion, ethnicity or national origin, will be removed from the platform.     \u201cHateful ideologies,\u201d including \u201csymbols, flags, slogans\u201d and even \u201cmusic or lyrics\u201d that espouse them, are also not allowed, according to the guidelines. However, BBC reported that TikTok\u2019s algorithm \u201censured\u201d a video with the lyrics \u201cwe're going on a trip to a place called Auschwitz, it's shower time,\u201d garnered more than 6.5 million views before it was caught and taken down. Other videos using the song earned another half a million views.        One anonymous Jewish TikToker began to post videos on Judaism and Israel on the platform in an attempt to combat the anti-Semitic attacks. \u201cOnce she started posting content about Israel, however, other users\u2019 reactions \u2018went from flags to death threats,\u2019\u201d The Post reported.     \u201cHitler did not kill enough [Jews]\u201d and \u201cJews worship Satan'' are some of the other anti-Semitic comments one of the Jewish TikTokers said she has seen on the platform.    The Post said that \u201cTIKTOK HAS failed at protecting Jewish users from antisemitism, and the app\u2019s content filtering system is often used against Jewish content even when it meets community standards, according to the girls.\u201d One of the Jewish users said that \u201cNazi stuff,\u201d or videos of Israeli flag burnings, remain available, however.    TikTok removed more than 380,000 videos and 1,300 accounts in the United States last month for violating its hate speech policy , reported Reuters.    TikTok representatives met with Israel\u2019s Strategic Affairs Ministry on On Sept. 8, during which hate speech on the platform was discussed. TikTok\u2019s public policy director, Elizabeth Kanter, said, according to The Post , that the company will \u201cnot tolerate hate speech on our platform.\u201d    Two of the Jewish TikTokers who spoke to The Post remain on the platform, while the third is reportedly taking a break with plans to return. One of them has since made her account private, fearing for her safety after she said she had received \u201cthreats all the time.\u201d Another said she hopes the platform gets deleted, but will remain because she said it needs \u201clarger and older Jewish creators\u201d to engage with and protect younger Jewish users, The Post summarized.      Tik Tok has censored posts about Donald Trump and Christianity , banned pro-life organization Live Action (later reinstating the group, citing \u201chuman error\u201d) and declined to send a representative to testify in the Senate during a hearing on Big Tech security.     Conservatives are under attack.  Contact TikTok at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:feedback@tiktok.com\">feedback@tiktok.com</email>  and demand that the platform provide clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d: Today, hate speech means anything liberals don\u2019t like. Silencing those you disagree with is dangerous. If companies can\u2019t tell users clearly what it is, then they shouldn\u2019t try to regulate it. If you have been censored, contact us at the Media Research Center contact form, and help us hold Big Tech accountable</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43204566192</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-FV81-F07F-81F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DHV1</classCode><className>ANTISEMITISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DN9X</classCode><className>HATE SPEECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00099LS</classCode><className>JEWS &amp; JUDAISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp; XENOPHOBIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D9R3</classCode><className>ETHNIC CONFLICTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC333</classCode><className>ISRAEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

A Camping World executive is even quoted calling Salesforce's software \"magic.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But behind the scenes in recent weeks, the Silicon Valley tech giant has delivered a different message to gun-selling retailers such as Camping World: Stop selling military-style rifles, or stop using our software.</p><p>The pressure Salesforce is exerting on those retailers -- barring them from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders -- puts them in a difficult position. Camping World, for example, spends more than $1 million a year on Salesforce's e-commerce software, according to one analyst estimate. Switching to another provider could cost the company double that to migrate data, reconfigure systems and retrain employees.</p><p>The change in Salesforce's acceptable-use policy shows how a technology giant that is mostly unknown to the public is trying to influence what retailers in America sell and alter the dynamics of a charged social issue. While Salesforce is hardly a household name, it is a dominant provider of software and services that help businesses manage their customers. With roughly 40,000 employees and a market value of nearly $120 billion, it has become a behemoth in San Francisco. Its branded skyscraper also towers over the city as the tallest building and a major landmark.</p><p>But its decision to force its position on guns on retailers did not sit well with some industry advocates. These types of rules are \"corporate-policy virtue signaling\" and discriminate against gun owners, whose rights are protected by the Second Amendment, said Mark Oliva, public affairs director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group.</p><p>\"It is a very chilling effect when a company as large as Salesforce puts out a policy like this,\" Oliva said.</p><p>Salesforce's new policy bars customers that sell a range of firearms -- including automatic and semi-automatic -- from using its e-commerce technology. The policy also precludes customers from selling some firearm parts, such as \"magazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds\" and \"multi-burst trigger devices.\"</p><p>The change affects \"a small number of existing customers when their current contracts expire,\" as well as all new customers, Salesforce spokeswoman Gina Sheibley said. She declined to name specific customers, but Camping World's Gander Outdoor unit sells a variety of semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines. Camping World executives didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>Gun sales have become a political flashpoint for retailers in the aftermath of shootings such as the one last month in Colorado. This year, Dick's Sporting Goods said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 stores, a move that the company acknowledged in a March securities filing led to \"an accelerated decline\" in its hunting business. Walmart ended the sales of military-style firearms in 2015, and last year it raised the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21.</p><p>Even companies that have no gun-related business are taking a stand. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. pledged more than $1 million in September to support nonprofits and youth activists working to end gun violence. Two months later, Toms Shoes pledged $5 million to similar organizations.</p><p>When tech giants enter the broader debate, the consequences are magnified because of the critical services they provide behind the scenes to customers. Consumers often don't realize they're interacting with other companies when they place an item in their shopping cart or chat with a customer service representative. But Salesforce and other big tech companies wield significant influence because of that reliance on their software.</p><p>This type of activism has also led to criticism of tech companies overstepping their bounds. Facebook, Google and Twitter have all faced increased scrutiny of censorship of what they deem hate speech or dangerous individuals. Web-security provider Cloudflare faced criticism in 2017 that it denied free-speech rights after pulling its protection from a neo-Nazi website involved in organizing the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>Salesforce's new policy could prove controversial in conservative states, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tom Roderick, who provided the estimates of Camping World's spending on the company's e-commerce software. \"Does this become a hot-button issue in states where people like their assault rifles?\" Roderick said.</p><p>It's not Salesforce's first experience with social activism. The company also provides technology that helps power the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency's border activities and agent recruiting, something that drew increasing scrutiny as the agency implemented Trump administration policies that included separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Last summer, roughly 650 Salesforce employees signed a letter to co-chief executive Marc Benioff raising concerns about the agency's use of its products, first reported by Bloomberg News.</p><p>The company hired an executive in December to run its new Office of Ethical and Humane Use to guide development and sales of its products. It's unclear whether the new executive helped develop the firearm policy.</p><p>Benioff has been among the most outspoken CEOs regarding social and political issues, including a tweet last year a day after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, left 17 people dead.</p><p>\"The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America. Ban it,\" he wrote.</p><p>A month later, he pledged $1 million to March for Our Lives, a group pushing for gun-control legislation.</p><p>At the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Benioff suggested social media companies such as Facebook should be regulated like Big Tobacco because of their similarly addictive natures.</p><p>Benioff declined to comment on the company's new policy regarding gun sales. ct19 0003 190604 N S 0000000000 00003533</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff is outspoken regarding social and political issues.

He has brought consensus to Westminster. And he's inspired Britain to be a global leader in technology policy without setting foot on British soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, the cross-party alliance that he has wrought comes at his own expense. Setting aside partisan battling for once, politicians of every stripe seem to agree that the titans of digital media should take responsibility for the harms their products can cause to public health, security, privacy and much more. And it would also be nice if they paid a fair share in tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the relentless turbulence of the Brexit debates, select committees in Parliament (led by the Tories and Liberal Democrats) have conducted serious investigations in the past few months into the social problems caused by the tech industry. Both have proposed major changes to the law. Meanwhile, the Government has promised a report that could lead to legislative action. Not to be outdone, last week Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, gave a major speech outlining his case for holding tech companies to account, praising the work of his Tory colleagues along the way.</p><p>What is remarkable is not merely the rarity of consensus, it is the heft of the ideas that have united politicians. What they are proposing is not a half measure that tackles the smallest part of a big issue. They have uncovered a hive of interrelated problems - the safety of children online, the security and integrity of elections, the privacy of citizens and the social consequences of a digital world ruled by unaccountable <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.monopolies.No\">www.monopolies.No</url> single solution is sufficient. To meet the scope of the challenge, lawmakers have proposed a duty of care for social media (a cause long championed in these pages). It is a simple concept - tried and true in British common law - that carries a lot of power.</p><p>The duty of care would establish a broad responsibility for social media companies to reduce the harms they cause to the public and empower a regulator to set and enforce rules that rebalance the power between their sector and society. Getting the details right is no easy task, but the level of ambition is impressive.</p><p>In this bold approach to putting the public in control of technology, Britain leads the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.world.No\">www.world.No</url> other country has proposed anything quite like it. And if the UK acts, it is likely that others will follow - including the European Union and the United States.</p><p>I believe that Britain has it right here. But I did not reach this conclusion lightly. I have spent most of my career advocating for unfettered markets for speech and commerce online. I believe deeply in the potential of connection technologies to empower democratic social movements, expand access to knowledge and provide opportunity for economic mobility.</p><p>In the first Obama administration, I served as a foreign policy adviser working to leverage America's technology and innovation as instruments of democracy. Though we were conscious of the potential abuses of digital media for social control and political propaganda, we felt that the benefits outweighed the downsides. And they did for the most part.</p><p>But in the past few years things have changed. Firms such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are now among the most valuable companies in history. Their products reach into every corner of modern society. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence have enabled a big leap forward in data collection, analysis, and the targeting of communications to predict and shape individual preferences and actions.</p><p>The profits reaped from manipulating consumer behaviour are extraordinary. But there is a darker side. These business models do not effectively block organised efforts to exploit their products in ways that harm the public. As a result, our children are not steered out of harm's way when they go online.</p><p>Data about every aspect of our lives is vacuumed up and used in ways that most of us never imagined. And our public debates are distorted through artificial amplification techniques on social media available to the highest bidder. These are serious and systemic problems.</p><p>So what now? Multinationals with market power are not going to police themselves. This is why the only solution is for government to set rules, to guide the power of technology markets to realign business and social interests - to make it clear that the best way for companies and investors to do well is to do good.</p><p>Britain is leading the world towards sensible answers to these problems.

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p> The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and App Store.</p><p> The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p> \"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said.</p><p> Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p> EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into complaints of unfair practices against Amazon.</p><p> British Financial Secretary Philip Hammond said the recommendations must be approved by Parliament to take effect.</p><p> Recommendations include setting up a digital markets unit that would give people more control over their data, letting them move or share personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p> The report's authors said \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p> The report also recommends getting big companies to share key data with startups, while safeguarding personal information, to help foster innovation and new business ideas; drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behavior for tech companies in their relationships with users; and rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers that could \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\"</p><p> Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to authorize a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p><p> Kelvin Chan is an Associated Press writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-ec44ac5a30ffea889398dd4ce5296d9fe18c3d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-R0M1-DXVP-V26G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And with the UK set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on December 12, it still is not clear whether, when, and how Brexit will happen.</p><p><br/>But assuming the UK does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the UK should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?<br/>Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to reach a trade and investment agreement with the US after Brexit. After all, America is the UK's largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source (and destination) of foreign direct investment.<br/>In seeking such a deal, however, the UK would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the US (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the US would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for UK exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting US standards \u2013 on drug pricing, the environment, food standards, and animal welfare, for example \u2013 is already creating a public backlash in Britain.<br/>As the UK prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the US and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors.<br/>The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the UK's financial services sector contributed \u00a3132bn ($170bn) to the economy, or 6.9% of total output, provided 1.1mn jobs (3.1% of the total), and paid some \u00a329bn in tax (in the 2017-18 UK tax year). The sector also generated \u00a360bn worth of exports in 2017 (against \u00a315bn in imports).<br/>But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it is not adequately regulated. The 2007-2008 financial crisis reduced UK national output by 7%, wiped out 1mn jobs, caused wages to fall by 5% below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the UK (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact.<br/>After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the US also accepted the need for robust regulation.<br/>Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry.<br/>The US, by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The US government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress testing and \"living wills\" for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of non-banks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws.<br/>Some investors would benefit hugely from US-style financial deregulation in the UK, and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardise the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the UK public from a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance.<br/>To date, the UK has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the UK public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them.<br/>The second challenge for the UK after Brexit will be handling the big US technology companies. Earlier this year, a UK Parliament report found that Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\" Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-US government to regulate or influence them.<br/>Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favour of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the Commission fined Google \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7bn) for blocking rivals in the online advertising market \u2013 the third time it has penalised the company for antitrust violations.<br/>The US government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), while Trump has previously been quick to criticise the Commission for fining Google.<br/>The UK relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to US pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework).<br/>Brexiteers claim that the UK can create its own \"global strategy\" and do things \"Britain's way\" after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, then-prime minister Theresa May said that after Brexit, the UK would rely upon its \"steadfast allies\" to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system.<br/>Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the UK in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it is not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder choices await the government that emerges after December 12. - Project Syndicate<br/><br/>* Ngaire Woods is Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/67/157307405180.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/67/157307405180.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-158825245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFH-0MT1-F11P-X0BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

And with the UK set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on December 12, it still is not clear whether, when, and how Brexit will happen.</p><p><br/>But assuming the UK does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the UK should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?<br/>Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to reach a trade and investment agreement with the US after Brexit. After all, America is the UK's largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source (and destination) of foreign direct investment.<br/>In seeking such a deal, however, the UK would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the US (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the US would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for UK exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting US standards \u2013 on drug pricing, the environment, food standards, and animal welfare, for example \u2013 is already creating a public backlash in Britain.<br/>As the UK prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the US and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors.<br/>The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the UK's financial services sector contributed \u00a3132bn ($170bn) to the economy, or 6.9% of total output, provided 1.1mn jobs (3.1% of the total), and paid some \u00a329bn in tax (in the 2017-18 UK tax year). The sector also generated \u00a360bn worth of exports in 2017 (against \u00a315bn in imports).<br/>But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it is not adequately regulated. The 2007-2008 financial crisis reduced UK national output by 7%, wiped out 1mn jobs, caused wages to fall by 5% below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the UK (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact.<br/>After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the US also accepted the need for robust regulation.<br/>Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry.<br/>The US, by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The US government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress testing and \"living wills\" for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of non-banks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws.<br/>Some investors would benefit hugely from US-style financial deregulation in the UK, and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardise the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the UK public from a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance.<br/>To date, the UK has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the UK public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them.<br/>The second challenge for the UK after Brexit will be handling the big US technology companies. Earlier this year, a UK Parliament report found that Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\" Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-US government to regulate or influence them.<br/>Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Furthermore, the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favour of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the Commission fined Google \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7bn) for blocking rivals in the online advertising market \u2013 the third time it has penalised the company for antitrust violations.<br/>The US government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), while Trump has previously been quick to criticise the Commission for fining Google.<br/>The UK relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to US pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework).<br/>Brexiteers claim that the UK can create its own \"global strategy\" and do things \"Britain's way\" after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, then-prime minister Theresa May said that after Brexit, the UK would rely upon its \"steadfast allies\" to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system.<br/>Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the UK in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it is not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder choices await the government that emerges after December 12. - Project Syndicate<br/><br/>* Ngaire Woods is Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/67/157307405180.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/67/157307405180.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-158825245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4T-CG61-JDJN-61W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Public anxiety about online platforms has been building for some time. Even the commentators who have consistently pointed to their huge benefits and argued against any regulation, such as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, have begun to acknowledge that a change is on the way.</p><p>This is not the moral panic that some argue accompanies the arrival of every new technology. Not a day goes by without the revelation of further harms. The suicide of Molly Russell, the live footage broadcast by the Christchurch terrorist, examples of child grooming, the rise in cyberbullying and revenge porn, and the destruction of lives and livelihoods in online gambling all point to a systemic problem.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/c43b637a-54cc-41ad-9854-f778b8fa2467.html\">Duty of Care campaign | Read more</url></p><p>At its inception the online world was heralded as an egalitarian public space that belonged to the people. Yet it has quite quickly become a Wild West, dominated by powerful vested interests and exploited by extremists. The White Paper is a wake-up call for society to debate what we want from the online world and ensure that it serves the common good and protects the vulnerable.</p><p>For some years I have been campaigning to bring in greater protections for those addicted to gambling. I had hoped that the gambling industry would self-regulate but it is rapidly becoming clear that they are incapable of doing so. Much of the problem is in the virtually unregulated online world where people can gamble day and night, often on their credit card.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/c43b637a-54cc-41ad-9854-f778b8fa2467.html\">The Gambling Commission's research has revealed that 55,000 teenagers in this country are problem gamblers, with a further 70,000 at risk of developing a habit</url> . Yet last week's expose by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) revealed that children as young as six are being targeted with gambling adverts. In a period of just two week it found more than 150 incidents of gambling adverts on eleven children's websites.</p><p>In another piece of research, also published last week, eight out of ten children, some as young as eight, could remember television gambling adverts. According to the ASA they shouldn't see any gambling adverts at all.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/c43b637a-54cc-41ad-9854-f778b8fa2467.html\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>There was a time when the global nature of the online world made it possible for people to shrug their shoulders and claim that regulation was impossible. Big companies blamed algorithms and said they weren't responsible. Now, with the tide turning, is the time to put that notion away forever: what we are seeing are global problems that require global solutions.</p><p>The Government's decision to impose a duty of care on all tech companies cannot be implemented too soon if we are to reclaim the online world and make it a safe place for everyone. However, to tackle the online world, much of it run from offshore jurisdictions, we cannot leave things there.

Another episode that day got less attention. The government accepted the recommendations of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, chief among which was to set up a \"digital markets unit\" (DMU), a regulator to oversee big tech companies and encourage competition online. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, on July 1st, the Competition and Markets Authority, a powerful regulator, released its study of the digital advertising market. It identified problems \"so wide ranging and self-reinforcing that our existing powers are not sufficient to address them\". It set up a taskforce to figure out what a new regulatory framework might look like. </p><p>One purported advantage of Britain leaving the EU is that it can regulate business better. In the case of technology, this might be true. Margrethe Vestager, Europe's competition tsar, is said to be looking at Britain as inspiration for changes to the EU's antitrust regime. Cristina Caffarra, an expert on European competition at Charles River Associates, an economics consultancy, has argued that the country \"is first in Europe to set off on an explicit regulatory experiment and articulate a detailed agenda\". </p><p>The big idea at the heart of the CMA's work is what lawyers call \"ex ante\" regulation. Competition law generally works on the principle of \"ex post\" enforcement. Broad rules are applied across sectors; antitrust authorities investigate and fine companies that breach them. For an industry as big, rich and fast-moving as tech, this can be ineffective. It is hard to prove harm in the traditional sense, and in any case companies pay up and move on. The new regime, which complements the existing one, would make rules specific to online platforms such as Google and Facebook (and potentially Apple and Amazon). These could include forcing companies to share data with competitors, making it easier for consumers to switch platforms and mandating the separation of data from different services owned by the same firm. </p><p>The government is considering an \"Online Harms Bill\", which would impose a duty of care on tech firms. A House of Lords committee recently recommended a code of practice for online political advertising. The government has also accepted recommendations to establish codes of conduct around the treatment of news media by online platforms. There is little co-ordination between these efforts, nor is anyone in government tasked with bringing them together. But many of these measures lead back to the prospective DMU, which will probably be some combination of the CMA, the Information Commissioner's Office and Ofcom, the media and telecoms regulator. The taskforce is due to complete its work by the end of the year. </p><p>After that, politics takes over. The thing to remember, says a senior adviser to the government, is that policy wonks get excited about regulating tech companies, but most people love their products. And Brexit brings challenges, including the difficulty of imposing regulation on American tech firms at the same time as Britain negotiates a trade deal with America. Moreover, regulating online advertising seems at odds with the desire to make Britain more attractive to big internet platforms, points out Ashley Hurst, a competition lawyer with Osborne Clarke, a law firm. </p><p>The government says it is \"committed to making sure that digital markets work for all\". What that vague aspiration means in practice will become clear once the taskforce finishes its work.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-LS8MORE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-8CV1-DY2R-200P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Failure to observe these new rules could result in fines of up to billions of dollars, criminal sanctions, and bans. Here's how companies including Facebook are responding. </p><p>The British government has set out ambitious proposals to regulate the internet[1] and bring to heel some of the biggest tech firms in the world. In a policy paper published on Monday[2], the government said it would create an independent regulator, tasked with policing harmful content on major platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube. Read more: Britain just laid out plans to end the internet's Wild West days and take a world-leading role in regulating big tech[3] Failure to observe these new rules could result in fines of up to billions of dollars, criminal sanctions, and bans for some of the worst offending websites. The UK government will now consult on its plans for three months before drawing up legislation. The industry is already having its say. Scroll on to see how big tech is responding to sweeping new internet regulation in Britain. \"The scope of the recommendations is extremely wide,\" says big tech lobbying group. Stephanie Keith/Getty ImagesThe Internet Association, a lobby group which counts Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, and Twitter among its members, has already raised its concerns. UK executive director Daniel Dyball said in a statement: \"The internet industry is committed to working together with government and civil society to ensure the UK is a safe place to be online. But to do this, we need proposals that are targeted and practical to implement for platforms both big and small. \"We also need to protect freedom of speech and the services consumers love. The scope of the recommendations is extremely wide, and decisions about how we regulate what is and is not allowed online should be made by parliament.\"Facebook: \"These are complex issues to get right.\" AP Photo/Andrew HarnikRebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of UK public policy, said in a statement: \"The internet has transformed how billions of people live, work and connect with each other, but new forms of communication also bring huge challenges. We have responsibilities to keep people safe on our services and we share the government's commitment to tackling harmful content online. \"As Mark Zuckerberg said last month, new regulations are needed so that we have a standardised approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone. \"While we've tripled the team working to identify harmful content and protect people to 30,000 and invested heavily in technology to help prevent abuse of our platform, we know there is much more to do. We are continually reviewing our policies with experts and working to ensure our reporting, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems remain industry-leading. \"New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech. These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the Government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective.\"Twitter: \"We are already deeply committed to prioritising the safety of our users.\" ReutersKaty Minshall, head of public policy for Twitter UK, said: \"To date, Twitter has been an active participant in the discussion between industry and the UK Government on how to keep people safe online. \"We are already deeply committed to prioritising the safety of our users, as evidenced by the introduction of over 70 changes to our policies and processes last year to improve the health and safety of the public conversation online. \"We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet.\" See Also: Britain just laid out plans to end the internet's Wild West days and take a world-leading role in

He said governments around the world are getting their head around the damaging side effects of big tech and regulation will follow. Britain is among those drawing up new tech laws, including around hate speech and inappropriate content, that could change the way firms like Facebook and Twitter do business.

That's the view of Damian Collins, the prominent British lawmaker who has conducted a year-long inquiry into fake news as chair of theDigital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee. When launched in September, his inquiry fixed on how false information spreads on the big online platforms. But after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in March, the probe evolved into a detailed inquisition into how Facebook data was weaponised to influence the democratic process. Collins, a Conservative politician, now thinks that it is inevitable that the British government will tighten the regulatory reins around companies like Facebook, Alphabet's YouTube, and Amazon. Collins spoke to Business Insider at his office in his Westminster. The long arm of his inquiry has extended to Silicon Valley and, over the past 12 months, he has come to believe that there needs to be tougher laws for tech. The 44-year-old politician has immersed himself in coding and combed through evidence in forensic detail. He is in regular contact with his peers in the US. One source told Business Insider he is part of an international WhatsApp group where politicians and witnesses share evidence. A bugbear for Collins is that he hasn't persuaded Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear before the committee in London, though he did secure something of a coup in landing CTO Mike Schroepfer instead. His committee's detailed questioning was a sharp contrast with the easier ride US senators gave Zuckerberg during congressional hearings about Cambridge Analytica. It's why some believe Zuckerberg has actively avoided a London appearance.2018 will be the year people understand the damaging side effects of technologyCollins has not given up hope of Zuckerberg appearing, but for now, he is optimistic that 2018will prove to be a watershed moment in people's understanding of how tech companies have potentially damaging side effects. \"It will be a pivotal year because we understand these things better and we're seeing governments starting to act,\" he told Business Insider. Collins pointed to Germany, which introduced a radical new internet hate speech law earlier this year. Companies like Facebook can be fined \u20ac50 million (45 million/$57 million) if they fail to take down hate speech in a timely fashion[2]. Facebook now has 65 staff dedicated to dealing with complaints made under the new law. \"The consequence of that decision is Facebook has invested so that they can comply. What it shows is that the tech companies, when they're required to act in a responsible way \u2014 and required by law \u2014 will do so,\" Collins explained.The MP thinks Facebook and others are not doing enough currently to make their platforms safe. \"There's an understanding that they need to be more forthcoming, but I still feel that they're always doing as little as they feel they can get away with doing,\" he said. Asked if he thinks tougher laws are coming, Collins said: \"All the people I talk to here [in Westminster say] that it is the direction where we're heading. The question is how far that goes.\" Collins thinks that government will make tackling illegal hate speech, such as terrorism recruitment propaganda, a priority. Theresa May's ministers will publish a white paper this winter, which will set out exactly how tech firms will be brought to heel. \"The test will be, does the [UK] white paper establish the legal framework which ends the platform neutrality of the tech companies, and creates legal liabilities for them,\" he said. \"I would imagine it would do that first on content that is already illegal. The question is, to what extent do you then look at other areas of harmful content as well.\"Britain can set the standard for the worldAnd America will be watching, said Collins. He has collaborated with US lawmakers, including Senators Mark Warner and Richard Burr, on his fake news inquiry, and said they are very interested in what the UK does next. \"In terms of our philosophy and our attitude towards free speech and the net, we're probably philosophically closer to the Americans than the French and Germans. I think the debate in the UK can be leading. The solutions we design here could be models that become standard in the rest of the world,\" Collins explained.The campaign for new laws is vociferous in Britain. Britain's biggest TV groups took the virtually unprecedented step last month of joining forces to write a letter calling for an independent regulator[3] to police content on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. The BBC, in particular, has been vocal about Netflix and Amazon Prime being subject to tightly controlled broadcasting standards and regulations in the UK.[4] Media regulator Ofcom has outlined plans to impose financial penalties on social media firms[5] that fail to remove offensive content in a timely manner. Collins said increasing Ofcom's powers could be sensible, while BuzzFeed reported last month that the government is considering a new independent online regulator.[6] Ministers are considering verification laws for users of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, according to BuzzFeed. There may be new rules for online ads, an area which is currently overseen by the Advertising Standards Authority.It's not anti-tech to want regulationCollins said his fake news inquiry and belief in new regulations does not make him anti-tech. He thinks that lawmakers are suddenly catching up with the tech companies that are reshaping the world \u2014 and any resistance to new laws is pretty normal. Christopher Wylie, the man who blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica weaponising the data of 50 million Facebook accounts, uses the analogy of the auto industry lobbying against seat belts and airbags. \"They said it would be too complicated, it would make it more expensive, it would scare consumers away,\" Wylie told Business Insider. \"Arguably, the automotive industry, like many other industries, have benefited from seriously considering the safety of customers, because ultimately, that reduces the likelihood that catastrophic events are going to happen to your industry. That maintains confidence.\"This resonates with Collins. \"I've never met an organisation that instantly embraces the idea of more regulation. There is sometimes a temptation for people to think this is sort of anti-tech. It's a bit like saying you're anti-car because you'd believe there should be seat belts in the car,\" he said. \"I fully support the amazing contribution and the transformative nature the tech sectors, our society has created so many benefits, but like just like any other industry, there are problems that develop as well,\" Collins added. \"We've been slow in governments and parliaments around the world to keep pace with the change the technology has brought and to make sure that the regulation and rules that do exist are actually still fit for purpose.\"NOW WATCH: Apple took another

The UK government said it wants to legislate for a new independent regulator that will oversee \"harmful content\" on social media, search engines, messaging, and file-sharing platforms. It would be the first time the UK regulates online safety, with the internet conventionally seen as ungovernable. If these platforms fail to keep hate speech and content relating to sexual abuse, violence, terrorism or self-abuse off their services, they will face huge fines under the proposed new rules. </p><p>Industry lobbying bodies representing Facebook, Google, and other big tech firms say the proposed laws are too vague and may harm competition. The internet's days as the Wild West may be numbered. The British government has laid out its blueprint for groundbreaking new laws that will regulate social media, search, messaging, and even file-sharing platforms for content that causes \"online harm.\" That's an umbrella term that includes content relating to sexual abuse, violence, hate speech and terrorism, self-harm, and underage sexting. The proposals, dubbed \"world first online safety laws\" in an emailed statement, coincide with global pressure on US tech firms to prevent self-harm, terrorist, and hate speech content from appearing on their sites. It also comes at a time when Silicon Valley leaders, like Mark Zuckerberg, are calling for regulation. Facebook, YouTube, and the more niche 8chan came in for severe criticism just last month when the suspected Christchurch shooter attacked two mosques and livestreamed the whole event. In February, Instagram banned \"extreme\" images of self-harm[1] after the suicide of British teenager Molly Russell. Read more: Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat execs could be named, shamed, and held personally liable for harmful content under new UK laws[2] The proposals, put forward in a white paper by the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, include a new independent regulator that would police these platforms for harmful content. It will have the power to issue major fines and even hold individual executives responsible for failing to comply with any new laws. Fines could reach billions of dollars for the biggest companies, Culture Minister Margot James told Business Insider in February[3]. Tech firms would also need to obey a \"duty of care,\" which would require them to take steps to keep users safe and to deal with illegal or harmful content. Other proposals include: Forcing social media firms to publish transparency reports about harmful content on their services, and the measures they take to combat it. Compelling companies to respond quickly to user complaints, possibly akin to Germany's controversial \"NetzDG\" law. Codes of practice that might require tech firms to minimise the spread of misinformation during elections. A framework to help tech firms build safety features into their apps from the start. A media literacy strategy to help people recognise misinformation and malicious behaviours. In a statement, British Prime Minister Theresa May: \"The internet can be brilliant at connecting people across the world \u2014 but for too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content. \"That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently. We have listened to campaigners and parents, and are putting a legal duty of care on internet companies to keep people safe. Online companies must start taking responsibility for their platforms, and help restore public trust in this technology.\"Big tech wants more detail about how the new laws will actually workThe proposals are still some way off becoming legislation, and what actually ends up becoming law may look quite different from Monday's policy paper after further industry and public consultation.The Internet Association, a lobby group which counts Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, and Twitter among its members[4], said the proposals needed tightening up. UK executive director Daniel Dyeball said in a statement: \"The internet industry is committed to working together with government and civil society to ensure the UK is a safe place to be online. But to do this, we need proposals that are targeted and practical to implement for platforms both big and small. \"We also need to protect freedom of speech and the services consumers love. The scope of the recommendations is extremely wide, and decisions about how we regulate what is and is not allowed online should be made by parliament.\" Coadec, a group which lobbies on behalf of startups, said overly-strict regulation could punish smaller firms that don't have the money and clout of Facebook and Google. Executive director Dom Hallas said: \"Everyone, including British startups, shares the goal of a safer internet - but these plans will entrench the tech giants, not punish them. \"The vast scope of the proposals means they cover not just social media but virtually the entire internet - from file sharing to newspaper comment sections. Those most impacted will not be the tech giants the government claims they are targeting, but everyone else. It will benefit the largest platforms with the resources and legal might to comply - and restrict the ability of British startups to compete fairly.\"NOW WATCH: Watch Google's Stadia

Far from being disadvantaged by the virus, most have actively benefited as consumers stay at home and rely increasingly on their devices to communicate, work, shop and stay entertained.</p><p>Meanwhile, big tech's business clients too are rapidly shifting operations to the cloud as they seek to adapt to a new world. </p><p>But the growing disparity also raises questions about Europe's failure to generate anything comparable.</p><p>Europe may have some fine universities, brainy entrepreneurs and a few exciting &amp;#x2028;start-ups, but it has so far utterly failed to produce genuine competitors to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Consider the fact that Europe's most valuable listed tech company is SAP, a German software giant, which at (EURO)167bn, or $198bn, is worth less than one tenth of Apple's valuation.</p><p>Next largest is Dutch chipmaker ASML, at (EURO)158bn (\u00a3142bn) while a cursory glance down the list makes clear an obvious fact: Europe's next biggest tech players are a puny bunch compared with Silicon Valley's muscle men.</p><p>London's top tech offerings are even more feeble with Sage, an \u00a38bn accounting software provider, representing Britain's largest listed technology company.</p><p>But what is to blame for this situation? Is it a more conservative business culture? A failure to effectively commercialise academic research? Or the dead hand of European regulation that stifles the kind of red-blooded capitalist endeavour on which Silicon Valley was built? </p><p>Or perhaps a mixture of all of these factors and more. Either way, as Britain looks ahead to Brexit, an opportunity exists to differentiate itself by becoming a better place for technology companies to invest and grow.</p><p>That must mean a more competitive tax regime and the rollback of regulations that have held it back in the past to boost innovation.</p><p>The comparison between the US and European public markets is not entirely fair, of course.</p><p>Some of the top technology companies in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia remain in private ownership, while US investors have always had a better understanding of the tech industry and markets there are more liquid.</p><p>That means many European technology companies end up shifting to the US or listing their shares there. </p><p>For example, Spotify - the Swedish music streaming company - is worth $49bn but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/20/apple-hit-2-trillion-middle-economic-catastrophe/\">decided to list its shares on the NYSE.</url></p><p>That trend, however, is part of the problem. Either way, as the global economy becomes ever more centred on technology, Europeans continue to buy their phones from US and Korean companies, use US and Chinese social networks and shop online via Amazon.</p><p>In the long-run that could ultimately mean they find it tougher to generate jobs and tax revenue to fund government services. Britain needs to find a solution to the problem.</p><p>                     Much to learn on the use of AI                    </p><p>The fiasco over exam marking this month has caused anguish for millions of pupils and exposed the big social risks of relying too heavily on algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>A hasty about-turn by ministers might have helped rescue Gavin Williamson's career -<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/20/apple-hit-2-trillion-middle-economic-catastrophe/\">for now at least.</url></p><p>But the implications don't end there. Algorithmic governance is emerging as a red hot legal area likely to prove to be a honeypot for lawyers for the foreseeable future. </p><p>From criminal justice to healthcare and education and employment, computational and predictive technologies are being rolled out at a rapid rate. </p><p>Like Ofqual's flawed grading algorithm, which used incomplete and biased data, many of these systems are poorly designed and are likely to spit out bad decisions. </p><p>The failure to properly supervise its creation and worse, press ahead with issuing results when it was obvious they were wrong, points to the urgent need for greater oversight. </p><p>Fortunately, a clear legal avenue exists for challenging these decisions.

She had already announced an investigation into the matter. Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica's account on Friday evening, saying that it improperly used personal information obtained from users. </p><p>Cambridge Analytica has come under fire for its role in helping President Donald Trump's campaign target Facebook ads towards prospective voters.Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, told the UK's Channel 4 News that she plans to apply for a warrant to raid the offices of controversial political research company Cambridge Analytica and seize its servers. The news comes after Channel 4 ran an expos on Cambridge Analytica[1], where the firm's CEO was secretly filmed offering toentrap politicians with bribes and sex workers on behalf of a client.[2] That report, in turn,came just days after CA was suspended from Facebook[3] over a data incident in which it collected information on around 50 million US voters without their knowledge or consent. CA was contracted by Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and the Brexit Leave campaign, in 2016. After a whistleblower came forward and as The Guardian and The New York Times were preparing to publish exposs, Facebook said on Friday thatthe data it used for ad targeting was improperly obtained and shut it down. On Saturday, Denham announced the opening of an investigation into CA, as well as other firms that use personal information to target ads on Facebook and other social media platforms.CA operates in the UK, but is headquartered in the United States. Here's the current statement on the situation from Denham, via the Information Commissioner's Office[4]: \"A full understanding of the facts, data flows and data uses is imperative for my ongoing investigation. This includes any new information, statements or evidence that have come to light in recent days. \"Our investigation into the use of personal data for political campaigns, includes the acquisition and use of Facebook data by SCL, Doctor Kogan and Cambridge Analytica. \"This is a complex and far reaching investigation for my office and any criminal or civil enforcement actions arising from it will be pursued vigorously.\" NOW WATCH: YouTube and Facebook have a serious problem with 'promoted' conspiracies about the Parkland shooting[5]See Also: Facebook is starting a $303 million

Ten months ago, a white paper proposed a \u201cduty of care\u201d for online platforms to safeguard users, with a new regulator to police it. Unveiling the next stage of its plans last week, the government said it was \u201cminded\u201d to turn Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, into Britain\u2019s new internet watchdog. But its latest proposals showed how much work remains to be done to create an effective, proportionate regulatory regime.</p><p>The draft legislation would see Ofcom oversee an online harms framework requiring social media platforms and other services to protect users from dangers including child exploitation, terrorist content, revenge pornography and hate crimes. Those found to be in breach of the rules \u2014 for example, for taking too long to remove material \u2014 could face potential penalties including fines or having access to their sites blocked in the UK. A similar law focused more narrowly on hate speech came into force in Germany in 2018.</p><p>Giving Ofcom this role makes sense. The regulator would have the power to require annual transparency reports, establishing both the scale of harmful content on sites and their efforts to fight it. It could also play a role in ensuring that platforms share data and algorithms with independent researchers. Provided sensitive personal information is handled carefully, this could greatly enhance understanding of the effects of online content, especially on vulnerable users.</p><p>Yet the plan is arguably a decade too late. Acting sooner would have given regulators a chance to scale up gradually to deal with ever rising volumes of content. Today, the amount of material on platforms including social media sites, video apps and online games is staggering. Ofcom\u2019s role would be to set the framework and look into complaints of breaches, rather than police all content. But its record in investigating violations of broadcasting rules \u2014 which can take months \u2014 highlights the scale of the challenge in the potential new rule, even with a much expanded team. The speed at which new technology companies can emerge only makes it harder to stay vigilant.</p><p>The definition of online harms is also insufficiently nuanced. Social media companies have proven fairly adept at removing explicitly illegal content such as child abuse, using algorithms and human moderation. Other topics are more ambiguous, such as disinformation: evidence from Germany shows regulators struggle to deal with satire. Expanding the \u201cduty of care\u201d umbrella to cover children having too much screen time \u2014 which the proposals hint could happen in the future \u2014 risks overburdening the regulatory regime.</p><p>Defining online harms too broadly could also undermine one potentially powerful enforcement tool: senior management liability. Having senior managers personally face potential fines or criminal liability has some precedents in the financial sector. But an overzealous approach could prompt companies to avoid setting up operations in the UK for fear of falling foul of the law. Rights groups warn, too, of damage to freedom of expression.</p><p>The government has much to do in fleshing out the code to support the regulator\u2019s work, before making its final decisions in the spring. Passing mentions of requiring \u201cage verification\u201d for certain sites, for example, fail to reflect the considerable technological challenges such systems entail. The UK is keen to show Big Tech that it has teeth, but it needs sound policy first.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-6760fade4f5f11ea95a043d18ec715f5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y77-XXT1-DXP9-9200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

And with the UK set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on 12 December, it's still not clear whether, when and how Brexit will happen. But assuming the UK does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the UK should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. </p><p>Where, then, is Britain headed? Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to reach a trade and investment agreement with the US after Brexit. After all, America is the UK's largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source[1] of (and destination for) foreign direct investment. In seeking such a deal, however, the UK would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the US (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the US would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for UK exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting US standards\u2014on drug pricing, the environment, animal welfare and food, for example\u2014is already creating a public backlash in Britain. As the UK prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the US and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors. The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the UK's financial services sector contributed[2] 132 billion to the economy, or 6.9% of total output; provided 1.1 million jobs (3.1% of the total); and paid some 29 billion in tax (in the 2017-18 UK tax year). The sector also generated 60 billion worth of exports in 2017 (against 15 billion in imports). But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it's not adequately regulated. The 2007-08 financial crisis reduced the UK's national output by 7%, wiped out a million jobs, caused wages to fall by 5% below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the UK (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact. After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform[3] to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the US also accepted the need for robust regulation. Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules[4] and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening[5] the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry. The US, by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing[6] core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The US government's agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress-testing and 'living wills' for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of non-banks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research on and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws. Some investors would benefit hugely from US-style financial deregulation in the UK, and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardise the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the UK public from a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis. It would also damage the City of London's place at the heart of European finance. To date, the UK has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers[7] accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing[8] large banks' retail operations to protect customers' deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the UK public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them. The second challenge for the UK after Brexit will be handling the big US technology companies. Earlier this year, a UK parliamentary report[9] found that Facebook 'intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws'. Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-US government to regulate or influence them. Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens' rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favour of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants' market dominance. In March, the commission fined[10] Google \u20ac1.5 billion for blocking rivals in the online advertising market\u2014the third time it has penalised the company for antitrust violations. The US government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), and Trump has been quick to criticise[11] the commission for fining Google. The UK relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to US pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework). Brexiteers claim that the UK can create its own 'global strategy' and do things 'Britain's way' after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, Prime Minister Theresa May said that after Brexit, the UK would rely upon its 'steadfast allies[12]' to establish an alternative to the EU's Galileo satellite navigation system. Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the UK in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it's not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder challenges await the government that emerges after 12 December.

And with the UK set to hold a crucial parliamentary election on 12 December, it\u2019s still not clear whether, when and how Brexit will happen.</p><p>But assuming the UK does leave the EU, its next government will need to begin the long, difficult process of negotiating new relationships with the rest of the world. That will involve tough choices, one of the thorniest of which is whether the UK should align its regulations in key economic sectors with those of the EU or the United States. Where, then, is Britain headed?</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to reach a trade and investment agreement with the US after Brexit. After all, America is the UK\u2019s largest single-country trade partner and its biggest source of (and destination for) foreign direct investment.</p><p>In seeking such a deal, however, the UK would have to decide how far it is willing to realign its regulatory regimes with those of the US (as American firms and investors want). Closer alignment with the US would create new barriers to trade with the EU, which is a much larger market for UK exports. Moreover, the prospect of adopting US standards\u2014on drug pricing, the environment, animal welfare and food, for example\u2014is already creating a public backlash in Britain.</p><p>As the UK prepares for life after Brexit, regulatory tensions with the US and EU could potentially flare up in two other important sectors.</p><p>The first is banking and finance. In 2018, the UK\u2019s financial services sector contributed \u00a3132 billion to the economy, or 6.9% of total output; provided 1.1 million jobs (3.1% of the total); and paid some \u00a329 billion in tax (in the 2017\u201318 UK tax year). The sector also generated \u00a360 billion worth of exports in 2017 (against \u00a315 billion in imports).</p><p>But the financial services sector poses huge risks if it\u2019s not adequately regulated. The 2007\u201308 financial crisis reduced the UK\u2019s national output by 7%, wiped out a million jobs, caused wages to fall by 5% below 2007 levels, and brought bank lending to a halt. All parts of the UK (and much of the rest of the world) felt the catastrophic impact.</p><p>After the crisis, an independent commission made a clear case for regulatory reform to protect the British public (and the public purse) from reckless bank lending. Policymakers in the EU and the US also accepted the need for robust regulation.</p><p>Today, however, America and Europe are pursuing sharply divergent approaches. EU regulators continue to strengthen prudential rules and capital requirements (especially for very large banks), and are widening the ambit of regulation to cover every asset and profession in the financial services industry.</p><p>The US, by contrast, has reversed course under President Donald Trump, whose administration has set about undoing core elements of the regulations implemented after the financial crisis. The US government\u2019s agenda now includes lowering capital requirements, weakening stress-testing and \u2018living wills\u2019 for banks, and allowing more proprietary trading and unregulated derivatives dealing. It is also intent on rolling back consumer and investor protections, reducing prudential regulation of systemically significant banks, undermining the regulation of non-banks and the shadow banking system, reducing funding for research on and monitoring of the financial industry, and taking a hands-off approach to enforcing securities laws.</p><p>Some investors would benefit hugely from US-style financial deregulation in the UK, and will continue to push for it. But their quest for profits over systemic safety would jeopardise the hard-won regulatory measures that currently protect the UK public from a repeat of the 2007\u201308 crisis. It would also damage the City of London\u2019s place at the heart of European finance.</p><p>To date, the UK has taken a robust approach to financial regulation and implemented measures that go beyond those introduced by EU regulators. These include a new regime aimed at holding senior bankers accountable for their decisions, and ring-fencing large banks\u2019 retail operations to protect customers\u2019 deposits from shocks to the wider financial system. And because the UK public broadly supports these measures, the post-Brexit government will presumably be hesitant to weaken them.</p><p>The second challenge for the UK after Brexit will be handling the big US technology companies. Earlier this year, a UK parliamentary report found that Facebook \u2018intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws\u2019. Yet the size and global reach of the big tech firms make it hard for any non-US government to regulate or influence them.</p><p>Instead, the EU has led the way in enshrining citizens\u2019 rights to data privacy, through its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And the European Commission has adopted a stance strongly in favour of protecting competition and limiting the digital giants\u2019 market dominance. In March, the commission fined Google \u20ac1.5 billion for blocking rivals in the online advertising market\u2014the third time it has penalised the company for antitrust violations.</p><p>The US government, however, strongly supports the free movement of data (which the big American tech companies want), and Trump has been quick to criticise the commission for fining Google.</p><p>The UK relies heavily on the big global tech firms, all of which are American or Chinese, and must therefore try to regulate them. Once it leaves the EU, it will face a choice between giving in to US pressure or finding a way to mirror EU regulation (including the GDPR and the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield Framework).</p><p>Brexiteers claim that the UK can create its own \u2018global strategy\u2019 and do things \u2018Britain\u2019s way\u2019 after it leaves the EU. In 2016, for example, Prime Minister Theresa May said that after Brexit, the UK would rely upon its \u2018steadfast allies\u2019 to establish an alternative to the EU\u2019s Galileo satellite navigation system.</p><p>Three years later, however, with Trump in the White House and the UK in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU, it\u2019s not clear who these steadfast allies are. And even harder challenges await the government that emerges after 12 December.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2577006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF9-T6G1-JDG9-Y1JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">But she said the expanded agency -- dubbed the \"first internet watchdog\" by UK media -- would lack the power to take down offensive posts or block platforms that violate \"their duty of care\".</p><p>Those suggestions were outlined in a set of proposals published last April by the government of former prime minister Theresa May.</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson took over in July and focused first on navigating the Brexit crisis.</p><p>But Britain safely left the European Union last month and his government is now preparing to stamp its own vision on the

-</p><p>Ofcom was established in 2002 and began to formally oversee television and radio the following year.</p><p>But Britain has no official internet or social media regulator and is looking for ways to stop harmful online material from reaching children.</p><p>The issue gained added urgency when a British schoolgirl killed herself in 2017 after following a series of accounts about suicide and depression on Instagram and Pinterest.</p><p>\"Two thirds of adults in the UK are concerned about content online, and close to half say that they have seen hateful content in the past year,\"

teams.</p><p>\"New rules are needed so that we have a more common approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone,\" Facebook said in response to Wednesday's report.</p><p>\"Any new rules need to protect people from harm without undermining freedom of expression,\" it added.</p><p>The big tech companies have said they also want the government to clarify how \"legal content\" is defined.</p><p>The Internet Association lobby, which represents companies such as Amazon and Google, said it had several \"issues of concern\" about Britain's plan.</p><p>These include \"the scope of regulation, treatment of legal but potentially harmful content, and enforcement powers,\" its UK chief Daniel Dyball said.</p><p>- No executive fines -</p><p>The government has been consulting top social media managers about its proposals for over a year.</p><p>Britain's role in drafting a universal solution was boosted by Mark Zuckerberg's

that would issue final rulings on contentious content.</p><p>The UK report said social media executives rebelled at the idea of London fining individual managers who fail to respond to the regulator's

The long-delayed and eagerly anticipated proposals lay the groundwork for legislation that could be passed in the coming months.  They were drawn up after consultations with social media moguls such as Facebook chief <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and have faced little resistance from other platforms that have also been blamed for allowing the spread of hate and abuse.  Some of the proposals have sparked concerns from free speech groups. </p><p> \u201cWhat we\u2019re proposing today is that companies that deal with user- generated content should take greater responsibility for keeping those users safe,\u201d culture and media minister Jeremy Wright told BBC radio.  \u201cThese are world-leading proposals. No one in the world has done this before.\u201d  \u2013 Punitive sanctions \u2013  The proposed regulations would see social media companies accept \u201cduty of care\u201d obligations that require them to identify and remove \u201conline harms\u201d.  Those that fail would be first issued warnings and then hit progressively with more punitive sanctions.  The government paper suggests that these include \u201cthe creation of new liability (civil fines or extended to criminal liability) for individual senior managers\u201d.  The most serious would see internet service providers block non-compliant websites and apps.  \u201cThis would only be considered as an option of last resort and deploying such an option would be a decision for the independent regulator alone,\u201d the plan says.  The regulations would only apply in Britain and should have no immediate impact on users elsewhere in the world.  But they may prompt other governments to take notice and follow suit.  Wright suggested the fines would be substantial.  He noted that those available to European Union authorities implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules on data privacy reached \u201cup to four percent of a company\u2019s turnover\u201d.  \u201cWe think we should be looking at something comparable here,\u201d Wright told BBC television.  \u2013 Minefield of problems \u2013  Wright\u2019s office is navigating a minefield of problems regulating an industry that largely functions outside the bounds of existing legislation \u2014 and whose harms are open to interpretation and remain undefined.  A joint letter sent by media executives to the British government in February stressed that legislation must be \u201ctechnically possible to implement in practise\u2026 (and) \u201cbe targeted at specific harms\u201d.  The government paper lists both \u201charms with a clear legal definition\u201d and \u201charms with a less clear legal definition\u201d.  The first include terrorist activity and a range of cyber-stalking and hate crimes.  The second lists disinformation and \u201cviolent content\u201d as a whole.  What types of harm fall where would be established by a new regulator whose enforcement powers would be funded by the social media companies themselves.  \u2013 Proportionate response \u2013  The social media boom was born in the spirit of a libertarian Silicon Valley ethos of innovation and non-interference from government.  But the industry is now facing a litany of dangers that range from the spread of state propaganda to promotion of teen suicide and \u2014 most graphically last month \u2014 the live broadcast of the slaying of 50 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand.  The techUK industry lobby group admitted Monday that platforms\u2019 attempts at self-regulation have fallen short.  But it also urged the government to avoid \u201ccreating discrepancies in law between the online and offline worlds\u201d.  \u201cGovernment have said that this will apply to all user-generated content (and) not only to big tech firms,\u201d techUK policy chief Vinous Ali said.  \u201cIf we are going to throw the net out so widely we need to make sure the proposed regulator takes a risk-based and proportionate response.\u201d  Britain\u2019s Article 19 free speech group also warned that the proposed legislation \u201ccould violate individuals\u2019 rights to freedom of expression and privacy\u201d. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGGOVN-RLPMN948841420190409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGGOVN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVK-9X41-DXCW-D06F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bangladesh Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"504\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The new standards unveiled Tuesday by a British data watchdog would require companies ranging from social networks to gaming apps to provide children a \"built-in baseline of data protection.\" Platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram will have to ensure children have the highest privacy settings by default, and targeted advertising and location tracking for children must be turned off by default. These proposed rules, known as the Age-Appropriate Design Code, also require companies to consider the \"best interests\" of children when designing new services, making sure they collecting data in a manner that protects children from exploitation and supports their psychological development. </p><p>\"There are laws to protect children in the real world \u2014 film ratings, car seats, age restrictions on drinking and smoking,\" Elizabeth Denham, the United Kingdom's information commissioner, said in a news release. \"We need our laws to protect children in the digital world too.\" She added: \"In a generation from now, we will look back and find it astonishing that online services weren't always designed with children in mind.\" The rules, which are now awaiting approval from Parliament, are just the latest sign that Europe is a step ahead of the United States on regulating privacy. And some American advocates are hopeful the privacy push across the pond could put pressure on Congress and U.S. regulators to take action. They argue the U.S. children's privacy law is overdue for an update: It was written more than 20 years ago, before the advent of smartphones and many of the services that the U.K. regulations address. James Steyer, the chief executive and founder of the families advocacy nonprofit group Common Sense, told The Technology 202 that he's \"thrilled\" to see Britain taking steps to protect children online. \"Young people should be able to learn, grow and benefit from technology without being subject to harms and this code establishes standards for companies to follow and prioritize children's best interests,\" he told me in an email. \"Parents, teachers and families everywhere deserve such safeguards, and we hope the U.S. soon follows suit.\" There are signs that the appetite to address children's privacy is growing on this side of the Atlantic. The Federal Trade Commission has been stepping up its efforts to address children's privacy in recent months, hittingYouTube with a record $170 million fine for allegedly violating the children's privacy law. YouTube had to make changes to how it addresses children's content on its service per its settlement with the agency. The agency has also launched a review of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) that could result in updates. But Congress has been slow to act. Children's digital privacy appeared to be one of the rare issues of bipartisan consensus in Washington last year, but lawmakers have yet to gain serious traction for proposals that would update COPPA, which was written in 1998 and only applies to children under 13. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced legislation in March that would update the law to include privacy provisions to protect teens under 16. It would also introduce a \"Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors\" that would limit the collection of children's personal information, and create a new division at the FTC dedicated to children's privacy. Some lawmakers have said elements of it could be included in a broad federal privacy bill. Reps. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Bobby Rush, D-Ill., introduced similar legislation in the House earlier this month, The Hill reports. However, it's unlikely that any children's privacy policies in the U.S. would be as aggressive as the U.K. code. The new rules are rooted in Europe's broad data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation. Like GDPR, companies that fail to comply would face steep fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue. By contrast, the U.S. currently does not have a general federal online privacy law. British industry groups and companies have also challenged the rules, warning that it could place a burden on start-ups and give an advantage to large tech companies that have more resources for compliance. \"The UK has been pioneering in relation to its protection of children on the Internet, particularly its move toward protecting children's data online, which is very fresh,\" Victoria Nash, deputy director of the Oxford Internet Institute and an expert on children's use of digital services, told The Financial Times. \"However, my two concerns are that this wide-ranging regulation tends to increase monopoly power of big tech firms, rather than decrease it. The second is a slight residual concern that it focuses on specific features or tools [like geolocation], which aren't in themselves always problematic.\" If the code is approved by Parliament, companies would have a 12-month period to update their practices, and it would come into full effect by autumn 2021, the British data regulator predicts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images The so-called Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act covers games explicitly targeted to players under age 18 as well as those for broader audiences where developers are aware that kids are making in-game purchases.

This month alone, Singapore announced a bill to clamp down on fake news, Taiwan said it would ban Chinese-owned video-streaming services and Australia rushed through its parliament a Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material bill, which among other things seeks to hold tech-company executives personally liable for failing swiftly to take down offensive content. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On April 8th the British government published a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms\". It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\". That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else. The harms covered are similarly extensive, from terrorist material and child abuse to more subjective things such as trolling and disinformation. Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet. </p><p>To be sure, there is a lot to iron out. The government appears keen to avoid stifling speech, imposing cumbersome regulation on small companies, snooping on private conversations or setting up large-scale monitoring of online traffic. But the paper is vague on how it will achieve its aims of proportionate regulation and monitoring without infringing on liberties. </p><p>Moderating content on the internet has so far been a losing game of whack-a-mole. This was brought home by the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand in March, when a video of the shooting and a manifesto written by the alleged culprit spread rapidly on some of the world's best-resourced social-media platforms despite efforts to prevent their dissemination. In the case of both copyright and terrorist- or abuse-related material, tech platforms are legally responsible for quickly removing content they find or are made aware of. Yet merely taking down objectionable content ignores the question of how it got there. </p><p>Britain's approach\u2014which it hopes will be adopted elsewhere\u2014is to require companies to design their services in ways that make it harder for bad content to spread in the first place. The big idea is to impose a statutory \"duty of care\". Companies must \"take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services\". The government will set up a new regulator or hand new responsibilities to an existing one, such as Ofcom, which oversees broadcast media and telecoms, or the Information Commissioner's Office, the data-protection watchdog. The regulator's mandate will be broad: publishing guidelines for companies, overseeing complaints, encouraging co-operation between firms and issuing fines, as well as other, harsher penalties, including blocking websites in Britain or holding senior managers personally responsible.</p><p>The eventual legislation will have to walk a tightrope between several conflicting imperatives. Maintaining national security and protecting the vulnerable must be balanced against individual liberties. Imposing substantial requirements on big tech companies must not stifle innovation or prevent smaller firms from thriving. And the new law must not conflict with existing British and European rules that protect online platforms from liability for content they simply host. On the last, the government's plans seem to suggest that, so long as companies live up to their duty of care by designing products in a way that discourages the dissemination of proscribed material, they will be protected. </p><p>Tech firms said they would work with ministers to fine-tune the regulations. They are already resigned to being kept on a tighter leash. Last month Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, called for more internet regulation in an article in the Washington Post. Draft legislation will appear at the earliest in the autumn, and is unlikely to become\u00a0law for a couple of years. A change of prime minister, a general election or continued parliamentary gridlock around Brexit could see it slip down the agenda. As the policy paper puts it, the government will \"bring forward legislation when parliamentary time allows\". In the meanwhile, the harms continue to multiply.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-SS7TDMK</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVV-4VS1-DY2R-22J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

And welcome to the BAT Capital Markets Day. (Operator Instructions) Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded. Today, I'm pleased to present Jack Bowles. Please go ahead with your meeting.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES, CEO, MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD &amp; DIRECTOR, BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.: Welcome, everyone, and thank you for meeting us today. There is a lot we want to cover today, about our business and about our strategic path. You will, of course, be wondering about the impact of coronavirus on BAT and on our industry. As you know, we are a major global business. And of course, the welfare of our people and stakeholders is a key priority. As you might expect, we are monitoring the situation extremely closely. And we're actively managing our business globally.</p><p>I would like to emphasize 2 things: One, our business is one of the most resilient sector of the global economy; and second, to date, we have seen no material disruption to our business. You will hear more on this area from Tadeu later in the webcast.</p><p>That all said, it is also important for you to see today some key things about us. Our strategic path and our long-term future. First, we have consistently delivered against our financial guidelines. We have delivered again in 2019. And at present, we are confident we can deliver 2020.</p><p>Second, we have a clear strategy for growth, founded on our unique cross-category consumer understanding. And we would like to tell you how this strategy is evolving.</p><p>Third, we are building capabilities. We have the resources to continue to fund investment for the future, delivering the balance sheet and deliver against our financial objectives.</p><p>And finally, we have a focused, high-quality team of people, some of whom you will see speaking today, to lead this business in the future. During the presentation, we'll go more into details on each of these points. We will demonstrate a number of things that we are delivering our financial results; that we are committed to our 2020 priorities; that we have a clear strategy to build a better tomorrow; and that we already started building the capabilities for the future. And we are already creating a bolder, faster and more empowered organization. I'm sure that you will find these short presentations useful, and we look forward to answering the questions at a later stage.</p><p>In March last year, I set out 3 clear priorities. In 2019, we have delivered against these priorities. We are creating a stronger, simpler and faster business, and our commitment to delivery remains unchanged.</p><p>In 2019, we delivered on all our financial commitments to the market, both in combustible and in New Categories, whilst also making significant additional investment for the future. And importantly, we delivered on our high single-digit earnings growth commitment. Furthermore, we remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targets. We expect revenue growth of 3% to 5% and high single-digit EPS growth, alongside strong cash generation, allowing us to continue to deleverage the business and deliver on our commitments.</p><p>Finally, although the environment remains volatile, we will continue to drive value from our combustible business, whilst driving a step change in New Categories and remain committed on our ambition to achieve GBP 5 billion of revenue in New Categories in 2023/2024.</p><p>Facing the opportunities ahead, it is clear to us that we need to evolve our strategy and purpose. We aim to build a better tomorrow and the heart of this is our new corporate purpose. Our purpose is to build a better tomorrow by reducing the health impact of our business through offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products to our consumers.</p><p>The pillars of the strategies are: first, our mission, which is all about meeting consumer needs through world-class brands; second, combustible value growth and step change in New Categories, which are fundamental to how to win; third, we are committed to deliver a better tomorrow and creating value for all our shareholders and stakeholders; last, we have a new ethos, energizing the company to create an organization fit for the future.</p><p>The presentations we have prepared for today will take you through more of the details of the strategy. But I would like to explain more, now the most important aspects now. Our mission is about stimulating the sense of a new adult generation. And to do so, we have to win in high-growth segments and priority markets.</p><p>As you will see later today, we are clear on where and how to focus our investment in order to win. We are the only player to have a global business across 4 categories. This gives us unique and superior consumer insights and foresights.</p><p>We leverage these to further develop and deploy remarkable innovations, partner with powerful brands. We are investing in a digitally enabled and connected organization, and we will energize our people and partners -- and partnerships to bring this to life.</p><p>Finally, our business in the U.S. gives us a truly global scale and a competitive advantage versus our peers. Our strategy recognizes the importance of winning in the U.S.</p><p>Fundamentally, our strategy is about meeting consumer needs and recapturing lost consumer moments, but it is also about addressing societal expectations. Over the years, consumer moments that used to be satisfied by cigarettes have been replaced by other products. With our unique cross-category consumer understanding, we are clear, there is a huge opportunity to recapture these moments with a broader portfolio of products that are less risky than cigarettes. These are new products that may, in time, go beyond our nicotine products. Meanwhile, we are going to continue to focus on generating value from our combustible business and adding a step change in our new existing New Category business.</p><p>For the long term, we will also investigate the opportunity to build a portfolio beyond nicotine, as this represents a clear future growth opportunity. We will do this in a way that is consistent with our new purpose. It is imperative that we follow clear boundaries to guide our portfolio expansion. We are clear that our portfolio expansion has to leverage our strength and our existing delivery platforms in vapor and modern oral; should reduce health impact compared to cigarettes; make a positive environmental contribution; and, of course, be strategically and financially sound.</p><p>In doing so, we will build a better tomorrow for our consumers by offering them a wider choice of products that is less risky than cigarettes and stimulate their senses. We are clear that our business should create value to all stakeholders, for consumers, for our shareholders, for our employees, and most importantly, for society at large.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of this, we're evolving from a business where sustainability and ESG has always been important to a business where it is front and center of all in what we do. We have, therefore, established a sustainable agenda for sustainability with key 4 pillars. The first and most important pillar is to reduce the health impact of our products and our business. Yet, we are all focused on 3 underpinning priorities; excellence in environmental management; delivering a positive societal impact in our supply chain; and ensuring robust corporate governance across the group.</p><p>In line with this commitment, we have stretched ambitious targets for the future. By 2030, we aim to have 50 million consumers in our noncombustible business. And we have a clear ambition for our operation in Scope 1 and 2 to be carbon-neutral by 2030. And these are stretching goals, which demonstrate our commitment to sustainability.</p><p>Our core strength has always been our people, and this will never change. To build a better tomorrow, we need an organization that is fit for the future. We have already started to transform the organization. In 2019, we announced project Quantum, the first step in building a simpler, faster, more agile organization. The project was largely completed in January of this year. It has already de-layered and streamlined the organization and reduced 2,300 roles. It will also deliver GBP 300 million of savings in 2020, to create the space to invest and to deliver against our financial commitments. Program Quantum is not just about organization design, it has also simplified our ways of working across the organization, allowing us to become a more energized, more efficient and a more resilient organization.</p><p>In addition, we are building the capabilities around the organization. We need these capabilities for the future and have hired more than 300 new specialists, managers in digital, innovation and direct-to-consumer, and we have simplified our ways of working across the organization, to become a more agile and efficient organization.</p><p>But no organization transformation can be delivered without its people, empowered and committed to the change. We, therefore, developed a new ethos with our people that defines the culture and behaviors required to drive the transformation and build a better tomorrow. We are bold, fast, empowered, diverse and responsible. All of these pillars, put together, are the foundation of our strategy for growth, and you will see this through all the presentations today.</p><p>BAT is changing. Today, BAT is a powerful combination of British American Tobacco and Reynolds American. Also today, BAT is a combination of a business with a strong multi-category business with a clear purpose of creating a better tomorrow. And we have recognized this through a new execution of our corporate look and feel. This represents the BAT of the future.</p><p>So in summary, we have an ambitious strategy for growth. We are committed to deliver on our financial targets. We are stretching new ESG ambitions. We are creating space to invest for the future and deliver on the financials. Therefore, project Quantum will continue, and we have the ambition to deliver GBP 1 billion of savings over the next 3 years. Tadeu will talk more about this in his presentation, where he will explain what a better tomorrow means for our shareholders. Thank you very much.</p><p>TADEU LUIZ MARROCO, FINANCE DIRECTOR, MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.: Thank you, Jack. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Tadeu Marroco, Group Finance Director. Our purpose for delivering a better tomorrow was set out by Jack in his opening remarks. I will now provide details on how this will drive sustainable shareholder returns.</p><p>Throughout my presentation, I would like to reinforce the following key messages. Over the last 3 years, BAT has managed to deliver strong financial results, whilst increasing investments for the future. We have taken a diligent approach to create space to continue investing and keeping delivering our financial targets.</p><p>BAT is a very strong cash-generative company with a relevant exposure for hard currency and a well-balanced debt profile. And we are fully committed to continue delivering -- deleveraging our balance sheet. BAT has the right strategy to promote a sustainable return for our shareholders.</p><p>Before I start my presentation, I would like to address coronavirus upfront. Jack has already alluded to the humanitarian impact of which we are all concerned and mobilized to mitigate as much as possible, securing the health and safety of our employees and partners. From the business perspective, we are fortunate to have a business that will be more resilient than others in the COVID-19 environment. We are not exposed to China on the demand side given that our sales in that geography is immaterial. We saw disruption in our New Category supply chain in February. Operations resumed from early March, and we expect to ramp up production over the next few weeks. We are also closely monitoring Tier 2 and 3 suppliers and alternative logistics routes from China, all of them working relatively well at this stage. But we are not completely isolated from the coronavirus impact. Our New Category site, we saw some out of stocks in certain SKUs and in certain geographies, which is now recovering. We postponed few launches, and we are seeing some certain disruption in activation activities in few geographies. The impact of duty-free New Categories is immaterial. On the combustible side, the supply chain is geographically diverse and is operating well so far.</p><p>On the demand side, apart of some softness in demand in some geographies badly hit by the virus, the biggest impact so far is in duty free, which accounts to less than 1% for group revenue.</p><p>I'd like to update you on the plans we have put in place to respond to this crisis. Of course, the health of our people is of paramount importance. BCP and crisis management teams and actions are underway and we are adapting our ways of working, utilizing technology. We are building stocks and supporting distribution across our network. We have demonstrated our continued ability to generate cash. Resource allocation is reviewed on an ongoing basis, and we are deploying tighter cash control measures.</p><p>Last week, we renewed our GBP 6 billion revolving credit facility backstop. This, together with other funding lines, which we were continuing to develop, give us good access to liquidity. As we stand today, there is no change to our 2020 guidance on group revenue and earnings growth. We also expect to continue to delever our balance sheet.</p><p>New Category revenue, as mentioned at year-end results, will be impacted in 2020 by the disruption caused by the coronavirus as well as the vaping market is still recovering from the U.S. slowdown in the second half of last year and the uncertain regulatory environment. We have a very resilient business as we saw in past crisis, and we will continue to monitor developments globally. And to the extent we see any further impact on revenue, we will seek to balance this with cost efficiencies, which will be accelerated as required.</p><p>As BAT, we are committed to deliver and have always delivered on our high single-figure earnings guidance. Over the last 3 years, we have improved our results alongside investing to establish our New Category business. We are coming from a strong past record. Group revenue was boosted by consistent market and value share growth of our combustible business. Meanwhile, we also managed to grow across each of the 3 New Category of THP, vapor and modern oral. Global powerful brands in combustible have allowed a strong top line performance. We have also worked hard on our cost base over the last few years. And today, we are in a very healthy operating margin position. We are confident we can continue to grow operating margin in future.</p><p>If we deep dive into the operating margin, you will notice that we are investing in the capabilities we need to create a competitive multi-category business, whilst delivering today. The underlying business progress shown in this slide, in green, is a consequence of the strength of our combustible business and operating efficiencies management. Alongside this margin growth, we have been able to invest in the new capabilities, as highlighted in the right side of the chart as well as built the global brands in the New Category space, which you can see in the investments in blue.</p><p>On -- our cash generation has easily above our long-term guidance of 9% cash conversion. We were able to set up free cash flow generation, helping to pay down the corporate debt. As a consequence of the cash generation as well as our earnings growth, we have consistently been able to delever the balance sheet at a rate of 0.4x on a constant FX. Due to the difference on year-end spot rate and average FX, we didn't see a linear trajectory of deleveraging over the last couple of years. We are now at 3.5 multiple and have an ambition to reach less than 3x by the end of 2021. We have now grown dividends on a continuous basis by more than 20 years. Over the last 15 years, our dividend growth on an adjusted constant basis has averaged 11%, even higher than our earnings growth of 10% annual growth in the same period. We are absolutely committed to maintain our 65% dividend payout ratio with growth in Sterling terms.</p><p>Looking forward, we have set 3 clear financial focus areas to create the space to continue delivering. The first one is release funds to support future growth. The second one is maximize the effectiveness of our marketing investment, mainly in New Categories. And the third one is to focus on deleverage our balance sheet. Let me show you each of them.</p><p>Our first priority is to release funds. We have an ambition to deliver a minimum of GBP 1 billion in efficiencies on an annualized basis over the next 3 years, starting in 2020. This will support investments and continued delivery in the medium-term as we build a strong business in New Categories. To that aim, we worked hard last year in the first phase of project Quantum.</p><p>As we announced before, this first phase was about a full review of the organization design of the group. This resulted in the creation of a much more agile, empowered and fast organization, by reducing layers and putting clear accountabilities in place. And although the main driver behind this first phase was to increase the business competitiveness in the way we operate, we also achieved savings. We will be delivering GBP 300 million from Quantum phase 1 in 2020.</p><p>Looking forward, we will focus our -- on further work streams in phase 2, including operational efficiencies with a focus on route-to-market reviews. We will continue to press ahead with our supply chain productivity agenda, operating as one virtual global factory with a one global planning hub and global procurement, managing 90% of our direct materials and [8%] of our indirect spend.</p><p>We have considerably scaled up our investments behind New Categories in the past 3 years, and we want to ensure we have the best return from these investments. We will be diligent using our methodology called MAPS, backed by consumer insights in order to prioritize the geographies and markets where we will be investing.</p><p>We will leverage data analytics and algorithm more and more to ensure we have the right information to make resource allocation decisions. We will be focused not just on growing New Categories, but also profitability. A key point to make it is that we will be first focused on winning the current categories that we are in and have a disciplined approach to further portfolio development. We will adopt a very disciplined approach to explore future opportunities in the beyond-nicotine space when the right time comes.</p><p>Cash generation is a key priority moving forward. The focus will be on working capital management as well as our CapEx. We don't anticipate any large debt-financed M&amp;A. We expect to leverage on our newly created corporate inventory to develop the partnerships that are needed to further enhance our competitiveness.</p><p>Our target is to delever the balance sheet to a ratio below 3x by the end of 2021. 2 years target helps to navigate through the FX volatility. We see a massive opportunity in the noncombustible space. There are already 68 million consumers using nicotine noncombustible products. And just around 15% of them are currently consuming our own products. There is a huge contestable space already existing today, and our focus will be to grow in this space now and in the future.</p><p>The winners will need capabilities, including brand building, strong distribution reach, IPs and science as well as knowledge to be able to navigate in a regulated environment. We already have all these capabilities in our business. And this will be a differentiator factor moving forward. We will be focused to ensure we have a future business in New Categories with the profitability as robust as we have today in our combustible business. We have already a very good position in terms of gross margin in 2 out of the 3 categories.</p><p>On THP, although consumables current margins are even higher than combustible, we expect some headwinds in future, mainly from excise and tobacco regulation. Some of that will be offset by continuous cost saving reduction. Over the last 3 years, THP device costs reduced by 30% and consumables by 60%. Consumables today is just 20% higher in terms of cost than our combustible products with a clear trend to reduce further as we increase scale.</p><p>On modern oral, with the benefits of no need for device, we already see high margins on our premium products. And if anything, we expect margins to continue improving as we benefit from scale. We also have a robust plan to enhance the vapor profitability moving forward. This is expected to be achieved as we see consolidation of the business towards closed systems and direct-to-consumers. The scale we will achieve as we consolidate our global brands will also be a key factor to improve profitability.</p><p>These are our targets moving forward. They will give us the flexibility necessary to create a competitive and sustainable business in future.</p><p>KINGSLEY WHEATON, CMO &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.: Thank you, Tadeu. Good morning, everybody. My name is Kingsley Wheaton. I am the Chief Marketing Officer of BAT. I've been with the group for 24 years. And I have done a variety of senior management roles over the last decade.</p><p>Today, I'd like to focus on 3 areas, in particular, of the evolved strategy. I would like to talk more about our mission, stimulating the senses of new adult generations, and how we make that a reality. I would like to talk about where we must win, which is all about winning in high-growth segments of the future and key priority markets. And I will talk in some more detail about the capabilities we are building in terms of how to win. And finally, I'd like to build on the purpose that Jack has talked about and think about key stakeholder outcomes going forward, particularly with a lens on our impact on society.</p><p>So we are absolutely committed to delivering a better tomorrow. We have long said that we have a multi-category strategy, a strategy that puts the consumer first and right at the center of all that we do. And we have unique insights across 4 global categories that can bring that to life. Also, we have many strengths, which are deep set within the BAT business, and we are investing in and accelerating new capabilities. I will talk about the what we're going to win with in terms of our portfolio, where we're going to win in terms of priority market focus and how we're going to win in terms of activation and execution.</p><p>And finally, this is a strategy which I absolutely believe is about a sustainable future for BAT. And I will talk about that very sustainability at the end of my presentation.</p><p>When we started to develop and think about the strategy, we had a long think about the core beliefs that underpin our business. And indeed, we have been showcasing and training those beliefs in a corporate advertising campaign, which has been running in the Financial Times since January. And you can see some of those executions in front of me. You've articulated -- we've articulated here our purpose, how we are committed to progress through delivering consumer choice, powerful brands, which is underpinned by science and brought to life by the wonderful diversity, which has always been a BAT strength. Just to give some market context, there are about 68 million consumers of noncombustible products worldwide, of which BAT has currently about a 16% share with 11 million consumers, giving us ample contestable space to drive growth into the future. Roughly, that marketplace in terms of consumer splits, 2/3 from our international markets and 1/3 from the U.S.A.</p><p>Translating those numbers into revenue, you can see that those 68 million consumers turn into about GBP 16 billion of net sales revenue, which we've currently GBP 1.3 billion or thereabouts. BAT currently has 14% share of that revenue pool, again, indicating there is substantial contestable space to go for in the future. The characteristics of our international markets are slightly different from the U.S.A., where the category split 3 ways in our international markets, between vapor, tobacco heating and oral products. Whereas in the U.S.A., we see almost exactly a 50/50 split between oral products and vapor products.</p><p>Of course, beyond the consumer numbers and how that's translating into revenue, there is a lot of change going on around us. And the context for our consumer-first multi-category strategy for growth is the societal change that's going on around us. And let's face it with 115 years of history, BAT has seen a lot of societal change and delivered and succeeded through all of that. That societal change is giving rise to consumer change, who are probably changing faster than we've ever seen before. And the consumer dynamics over the last 5 years or so are probably the most progressive we've seen in the industry's history. That is amplified and accelerated by social media and the speed of today's communication.</p><p>So if we have a strategy to win, that strategy must be about winning in the high-growth segments of the future because it is upon those high-growth segments of the future that we will be able to deliver long-term sustainable growth, which is absolutely critical.</p><p>If we take a step back and think about how that consumer has changed over the last 20 or 30 years, we can quite easily see that 20 or 30 years ago, smoking was able to satisfy a variety of consumer moments. And over time, as there has been societal shift and regulatory change, some of those moments have been reduced. And so therefore, we think that with a new portfolio, with a broader portfolio of tobacco and nicotine and over time and beyond, we will be able to recapture those consumer moments to fuel our sustainable growth over the long term.</p><p>And Jack talked about this earlier, our portfolio evolution, which goes from combustibles through new categories and beyond nicotine. And how social acceptance improves as we move from the left to the right. If we unpack that a bit further, as we build a combustibles business for value generation, which is the engine room of value creation, if you like, of our business, we are able to regain moments with New Categories products, and we're committed to delivering a step change in that. And we are able to find more moments and indeed more consumers when, over time, we think about moving into a broader portfolio that takes us beyond nicotine.</p><p>Of course, the limits to that portfolio expansion are not boundless, and Jack touched upon the clear boundaries that we have set for that portfolio expansion. We must leverage the hard-won competency and capability that we have in our current delivery platforms, particularly vapor and modern oral. We have very long-standing capability in the areas of science and regulation, which will underpin our portfolio expansion going forward. And that would all be nothing without using BAT's global marketing reach and expertise. And I think it would go without saying that our portfolio expansion would always be subject to stringent financial and strategic attractiveness tests.</p><p>And we are clear about the regulatory pathway that we seek going forward, and we are actively trying to shape the desired regulatory frameworks for our portfolio. We believe in category-specific regulation, that is to say regulations for the 3 categories of vapor, modern oral and tobacco heating. We think that regulation must be and should be scientifically evidenced and supported. We argue for product standards, clear packaging and labeling, responsible marketing standards, which is something we've been doing since 2001 when we launched our first international marketing principles, and of course, our products and our portfolio should be for sale to people of legal age and above only.</p><p>I've touched on the science and evidence base that underpins that regulatory view and how we're trying to shape regulation going forward in a smart way. I just want to update on behalf of Dr. David O'Reilly, where we are with our science program. We are nearing completion of our glo scientific assessment. We are in a very strong position, I think, with Vuse given the PMTA submission we made on Vuse Solo in December. And more of the Vuse portfolio is to come before the May deadline. We have the science now to support Velo as a reduced-risk product. And with this science package, we're able to build increasing confidence with our consumers in our products, which supports our purpose going forward. And we are in the early stages of doing the right scientific work, as you would expect, on our portfolio that will go beyond nicotine.</p><p>Another really important leg of R&amp;D and our portfolio expansion is intellectual property, and we have been very, very active in that area. We've had a step change in patent filings since 2017 with twice as many patents filed in 2019 as just 2 years ago. We are stepping up the talent and the capabilities we have in that area with external recruitment, enabling us to bolster our capabilities. And we're not only building IP organically through our R&amp;D hubs in Southampton and in the U.S., we're also buttressing the IP portfolio through the M&amp;A that we've been doing. And of course, I think you would go absolutely without saying we are absolutely committed to robustly defending, protected and pursuing our IP rights on a going-forward basis.</p><p>So our mission is all about stimulating the senses of new adult generation. I think this is a really, really exciting for BAT. This is a consumer-first strategy, and I believe we stand at a pivotal moment. I think we will transition from a business which defines itself by the products it sells to the consumer needs that it meets, through a broader, expanded portfolio of tobacco, nicotine and beyond.</p><p>In order to understand our consumer better, we have our proprietary intelligence segmentation methodology or PRISM. And we talked about that last year at the Capital Markets Day. That is a unique multi-category view of the consumer. It allows us to see over the horizon, over the arc of the horizon and be predictive about where the consumer is heading and what they demand of us next. And that PRISM system allows us to guide our portfolio development and portfolio structure and frames what we have in terms of our portfolio today and tomorrow.</p><p>Using our market prioritization system or MAPS, we're able to take that portfolio and ensure that we are focusing on the right markets and the right priority opportunity spaces for the maximum commercial success. This is about deploying the right products in the right places to the right consumers, driving maximum consumer resonance and investment efficiency. We put it through all of our products through a 4-step process where we look at the consumer and the commercial opportunity. We evaluate those products in any given marketplace against the product satisfaction index or PSI, which Paul will talk about later. We overlay the regulatory and tax environment, both today and as we anticipated into the future. And we assess the distribution and channel landscape that's available, and that allows us to figure out how to build the right portfolio in the right place and deliver the right returns to BAT.</p><p>And finally, capabilities. As I said earlier, we've been a business -- a public listed business for 115 years. We have many deep set capabilities, and we will continue to leverage our global marketing reach and scale. But also, we have new capabilities, and we are using those to accelerate our transformation. We are investing in those for the future, and we are committed to speeding up the development of things like foresights beyond nicotine, 21st century brand building, direct-to-consumer through our e-commerce model. And Paul will talk about those in more detail later.</p><p>In essence, we're going to take our long-standing deep set capabilities that this group has and partner with them with new to world capabilities to accelerate our transformation story.</p><p>So if I put that all together and think about our consumer-first multi-category strategy in action. We have a mission, which is about stimulating the senses of a new adult generation. We have our proprietary insight system, PRISM, which guides our portfolio development. We use our MAPS system to understand priority markets' focus and investment returns. And then we link that to our in-market activation and execution to build our products and brands as fast as is possible to deliver returns to BAT. This is an exciting framework, which will power long-term growth in high-growth segments of the future.</p><p>I just want to come back to our sustainable future, which was the third leg of my presentation. We have split our stakeholders into 4 in our strategy: consumers; society; employees; and shareholders, and we aim to deliver a better tomorrow to all 4 of those stakeholder groups. But I would like to focus here on how we deliver a better tomorrow to a society, in particular.</p><p>And Jack has outlined our ESG mission earlier. And that is a business where sustainability, which has always been important, is put front and center in all that we do. And I personally am very, very excited about that mission and accelerating that journey going forward. Although we don't do it for this, it is nice to be rewarded and recognized, and we have been acted -- active in the world of sustainability for 2 decades and more. We were industry pioneering when we entered the DJSI, and we have been a member of the World Index for 18 years consecutively.</p><p>Most recently, we received a SEAL Award, which places us in 1 of the 50 most sustainable companies in the world. If you have a look at the all-important sustainability indices on the MCSI, we are currently BBB, and on Sustainalytics, we post a score of 65 out of 100. There's lot more work to be done, but we have a great starting point, and we are committed to accelerating our ESG approach.</p><p>I'd like to now play a short video, which encapsulates our ESG journey so far and a hint of where we're going into the future.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KINGSLEY WHEATON: Jack has talked earlier about our really big ambitions for the future. And I am really delighted to be able to reemphasize our commitment to these 2 ambitions for the future. So we aim to have, by 2030, 50 million consumers worldwide of noncombustible consumers, that's up from the 11 million we have today, a journey of an additional 39 million consumers over the next decade.</p><p>And also, I'm very pleased to say that we have an ambition to be carbon neutral in our operations over the same time period, also delivering that in 2030. Those are our ambitions. The organization is excited, motivated and energized about accelerating this ESG journey.</p><p>And to bring that to life, we have framed a new sustainability agenda. The headline act, of course, is reducing the health impact of our business, but there are 3 really, really critical supporting pillars. That's about excellence in environmental management, making sure that we deliver a positive societal impact through our value chain, and as you would expect, the highest standards of corporate governance. But I think more than the agenda itself, it's about accelerating those ambitions. It's about measuring those ambitions against clearly laid out metrics and objectives and making sure we publish our progress so that people, our stakeholders, can monitor our journey over the next years to come, culminating in those 2030 ambitions.</p><p>So we have a clear consumer-first multi-category strategy for long-term sustainable growth. This strategy is about winning in high-growth segments of the future to deliver sustainable value. There is a large pool of noncombustible consumers today, some 68 million of them and growing, and we aim to have 50 million consumers by 2030. We're going to do this through a broader portfolio of tobacco products, nicotine products and beyond, and we have a system for activation and execution, which takes us for mission through our insights, guides our portfolio through our MAPS system in terms of where to win, which we link to our capabilities to ensure powerful activation and execution. And all of that is supported by 2 big sustainability goals: The number of consumers we have in the future; and our commitment to carbon neutrality in 2030.</p><p>So I've been with BAT for 24 years. I feel more excited today than when I joined 24 years ago about the future of this business. I'm very excited to see this evolve strategy in action. And as I said, I think we are at a crucial moment as we turn from a company that defines itself by the product it sells to the consumer needs that we can increasingly meet. Thank you very much, indeed. I think we will now have a short coffee break.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>PAUL LAGEWEG, DIRECTOR OF NEW CATEGORIES &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.: Good afternoon, and welcome back. I am Paul Lageweg. My role is Director for the New Categories. And in the last year, my key focus has all been about step-changing the performance in the New Categories. And this is obviously a key pillar of our newly articulated strategy, and you have heard Jack and Kingsley explain this, and we are making good progress.</p><p>Firstly, and this is very important for you, I would like to reinforce that the growth of the New Categories is a very positive development for the industry that provides higher and more sustainable levels of industry revenue, of course, for 2 simple reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the gross margin of these products are generally higher than what we are enjoying for cigarettes. And secondly, we're regaining consumption moments that we have lost for cigarettes, and BAT is increasingly doing well. There is an enormous amount of work happening in building the right capabilities, and that is to ensure our competitiveness over the mid to long term through a major transformation of BAT itself. We are not yet where we want to be in tobacco heating products, but we are making good progress in closing down the gap in product performance, especially in terms of sensorial satisfaction. We are already the clear winner in all key vapor markets by consistently growing share. And we have become the global leader in modern oral, a category with a massive future growth potential. And as part of our newly articulated strategy, we also see a midterm opportunity to explore beyond nicotine.</p><p>You should recognize that the emergence of New Categories is still in its infancy. Not only far more smokers will switch to reduced-risk products, but also the categories themselves will transform. And we want to lead this industry evolution as this offers a massive growth opportunity to BAT. And this growth is value accretive, not only is the margins per unit are generally higher for reduced-risk products due to the lower excise rates, but also as we're regaining consumer moments. And even consumers that haven't yet fully converted and are still using a combination of combustibles and New Category products are also more profitable as they tend to use a lot of New Category products at times that they cannot smoke. We are already seeing how this is sustaining higher levels of industry revenue growth. And we grew our revenues last year by 5.6%, supported by the growth of our New Category products. Now very few large global consumer packaged goods companies manage to deliver that level of revenue growth. As you know, we as BAT, have always believed in a multi-category portfolio. This is core to our strategy. And the level of satisfaction that each category delivers in each market is an important driver of its commercial success.</p><p>So this is a simplified version of our satisfaction index. In the low-flavor markets, like, for instance, Japan and Korea, THP provides a high level of satisfaction. While in the mid-flavor markets, like, for instance, in Eastern Europe, the picture is more balanced. While most of the -- rest of the world, in the high-flavor markets, vapor is clearly preferred. Now the very important thing for me is that modern oral has a universally high appeal and therefore, has a truly very large global potential. This product satisfaction index is only one of the inputs in how we determine which categories to launch in which markets.</p><p>We also take into account other factors, like, for instance, the regulation and excise environment and our capability on the ground, our ability to win. And this really allows us to launch the wide categories in the wide markets with optimal resource allocation. The multi-category portfolio approach is clearly right, but we must prioritize ruthlessly.</p><p>Kingsley already shared that cigarettes have lost some of their historic needs and moments. And that now in especially the developed markets, they predominantly are occupying this classic space. But through our multi-category portfolio, we can reclaim most of these moments and needs. So we are growing the cake itself. And we are targeting each of these consumer spaces with one dedicated brand. Now FLOW is this new space beyond nicotine, and I will explain that a little bit later in more detail. But we have a very solid foundation. We are the global market leader in modern oral. We're also the leader in vaping in Europe, and we're increasingly becoming a strong #2 in vaping in North America, and we're also the #2 in tobacco heating products.</p><p>So in total, we have now 11 million consumers that are using our noncombustible brands on a weekly basis. But we want more, and for that, we have to establish new capabilities. So we are working hard on an entire transformation of BAT itself. We are building several new and powerful capabilities that will become a key source of competitive advantage over the mid to long term. So let me just give you a few examples.</p><p>It obviously all starts with the consumer. We believe that having superior multi-category consumer insights and foresights will be a true competitive advantage. We're the only company that has this multi-category understanding of consumers. And in those fast-chasing categories, we need foresights and more fundamental understanding of the underlying consumer drivers. We also need to collect these foresights much faster, for instance, instead of doing large traditional consumer surveys with traditional field work and then tabulation of results that can easily last up to 2 months, we now have online expert panels for each of our categories that provide insights within a few days. And a lot of our consumer research was always done locally, but it didn't always ladder up to relevant global insights. So we have now replaced this with a global program where all data goes into a large database. And we combine this data for any question that we have about our business. And of course, we are also extensively leveraging this powerful database of 7 million consumers. I think that the design of our New Category devices, including, of course, the user interface and user experience, are very important choice drivers for consumers.</p><p>Now we lacked capability in this area, and our devices are simply not looking good enough, but we have hired a world-class Head of Design, who is now building hubs in Asia and the U.K. where we work with leading external partners to ensure that the design of our devices drives very strong consumer appeal.</p><p>We're also building a more agile and externally focused innovation model. And this has already cut our development time in half and build a much stronger pipeline of truly breakthrough technologies. For instance, we established open innovation hubs in China, Shenzhen and in the U.K. last year, and we will do the same this year in San Francisco and Israel. And in those hubs, we systematically scan the market for new ideas and new solutions but also we develop most of our new platforms with strategic external partners.</p><p>So let me just give you one more example. We are also entirely changing how we interact with consumers. We have now 7 million consumers in our database. And we know a lot about each of those consumers. And that allows us to interact with them in a highly personalized basis. This is very effective, and it is reducing conversion cost by up to 85%. Now we are also driving a lot more of our consumer base into e-commerce, so, for instance, subscription models. So our e-commerce is now becoming a multi-category platform, and that allows us to introduce new categories, but also new offers at a very low cost. So this is truly a major transformation of BAT itself. And we are bringing a lot of new top talent into the company to lead this transformation.</p><p>Last year, we recruited more than 300 managers externally. And of course, that has all been funded by project Quantum and the resource allocation that we're doing within the business.</p><p>So let us now quickly walk through each of those categories. Starting with tobacco heating products. We are not yet where we want to be. We are working hard to improve our product competitiveness. As the first step, we launched glo Pro and Nano at the end of last year. We're also building on the learnings of glo Sens, and we make further improvements this year through the launch of glo Hyper in April.</p><p>So step-by-step, we will be closing the gaps. But an acceleration is clearly required. Last year, we grew only 23% in terms of revenue. And our share was flattish for most of the year. So today, we have only 15% of the global THP category, and that is predominantly concentrated in North Asia where the category is already saturating. We have always done very well amongst considerates. This is a relatively older cohort that is looking for milder taste. They don't care as much about the design, but they want products that are easy to use and clean and value is also important to them. But clearly, the much bigger opportunity is among the innovation enthusiasts, even more so in Europe. These are relatively younger consumers that came from smoking higher flavor cigarettes. So taste intensity is very important to them. They also like to explore novel flavors. And for them, the size and design of the device are very important. So for us, to grow our business in tobacco heating products, we need to do much better amongst this group.</p><p>As the first step, we launched therefore, glo Pro and Nano at the end of last year. And glo Pro is really the first device that has tobacco -- sorry, that has induction heating. It also has a boost button and it delivers, therefore, much higher levels of taste intensity. While Nano is more stylish, and the first step, therefore, towards addressing our device appeal. We were flattish for most of last year, but since the launch of Pro and Nano, we are back to growth again in Japan. And the same counts elsewhere like Russia, where we are still focusing only on the top 5 cities, but we're growing strongly from a low base. We have now 2.2% share in Moscow of total nicotine and we will therefore now be expanding to another 10 cities in Russia. Not only our growth has improved but also the conversion rates have improved after the launch of glo Pro and Nano. So this is a good step in the first direction.</p><p>Now not all our launches have been as successful as this. The performance of glo Sens has been below our expectations, but we fully understand why performance is not better. We have captured the learnings as we still see a sizable opportunity in offering the best of both worlds between tobacco heating products and vaping. This was still a legacy project. We clearly have to design this a bit differently, and that is what we're doing now. But it is evident that step-by-step, we are closing the gap.</p><p>The next significant step is being launched right now, glo Hyper. This product delivers the best taste intensity in the market. It has a regular premium king stick format with 30% more tobacco. It also uses our patented induction heating technology with the boost button for extra satisfaction.</p><p>So for most of last year, we still had an inferior platform. But going forward, we are now very competitive, especially on sensorial satisfaction on taste and on flavors. And then we have this regular premium king format that we know consumers know and love. So this is a big step forward, but there's always more to be done. For instance, we have more work to be done on device appeal. But it is clear that consumers like this new Hyper experience. Here, we offer a much higher level of taste satisfaction that can also be controlled through the boost button. We have a familiar premium king stick format with 30% more tobacco in addition to our slimmer format. And unlike the market leader, we offer a wide variety of capsules with different flavors. And 2/3 of our franchise is already today in menthol and other flavors. So this is also a key area of strength that will benefit us during the menthol ban in Europe in May.</p><p>So in summary, we are making step-by-step progress to reduce our gap in competitiveness. Still lot more to be done. But I am confident that we will credibly emerge from a distant #2 to a very strong #2 in tobacco heating products.</p><p>Now let's now move on to vaping. This is already a category where we are ahead or where we are in THP. And as a result, we are now consistently gaining share in truly all the key vapor markets around the world. We are the clear market leader in Europe, and we are determined to become the global leader. And these results are driven by a superior portfolio, combined with powerful consumer engagement, building a strong global brand, and we are making progress to enhance our profitability. And as I mentioned, we're clearly winning now in all key vapor markets.</p><p>Now this is the superior portfolio. So we have both the stylish ePod, what is called Alto in the U.S., which is superior on all key attributes versus the competition. And then we also have the power horse, ePen 3, which delivers almost 3x the vaping cloud of our competition. And this is especially relevant in the European [TBD] markets with nicotine ceilings. So both these platforms are superior. And therefore, it's not surprising that consumers in the U.K. have awarded us now for the second year in a row with the product of the year award against all our key competitors.</p><p>Now not only our platforms are superior, we have also done a lot of work recently on our flavors. And we're now rolling out a portfolio of flavors, of which most are the absolute best in the entire industry. And then we're doing a lot of work to premiumize our brand offering through limited editions, color ranges and accessories. And for all our brands, we're doing a lot of work to reduce the environmental footprint, the impact on the environment. For instance, in the case of Vuse, we eliminated the silicon hygiene caps from our cartridges. Our new packaging that we will soon be introducing will not have any outer plastic wrap anymore, and we're also increasingly starting to recycle the cartridges itself in most of our markets.</p><p>But really key driver of our success is our highly effective marketing campaigns. We have won several prestigious awards for our marketing campaigns, including an Effie and an IPA. This is truly unprecedented for our industry and a great reflection of the strength of our marketing efforts.</p><p>As part of that, we're also transforming our retail stores. You may remember that we acquired a number of vaping retail chains in recent years in the U.K., Germany, Poland and South Africa, with a total of about 750 stores. Now all these stores are totally different today with names like Twisp, High End Smoke and VIP. But we also have a very different portfolio in all these stores. So we have piloted bringing these stores together under the same Vuse inspiration store banner with the same portfolio, the same layout and the same consistent retail practices. This has been hugely successful, so we are now planning to convert all of our stores during 2020. In addition, we plan to open some new stores as well. For instance, just today, we opened a store here in London on Oxford Street. Now when we attract consumers into our superior closed systems, we try to guide them very quickly to our e-commerce platform. So this is growing rapidly. We had 5 million visitors last year, and we are doing much better now to convert them to loyal consumers, for instance, leveraging subscription models, amongst others. And this is on average, providing 40% higher profit per user.</p><p>Now vaping is by far the largest reduced-risk product category in terms of the number of consumers. But we also have to improve its profitability. And the good news is that the industry profitability continues to develop very positively. You will remember that the category just a few years ago was dominated by open systems. So you had thousands of brands, open liquids, that were predominantly being sold in vape stores and dedicated online retail, and they actually made most of the margin out of the category. This is now quickly transforming to branded closed systems, so predominantly in our traditional retail, where our strength is and where retail margins tend to be significantly lower. So the industry is quickly consolidating around a few big global brands that are all controlled by the tobacco major. And regulation, like the FDA in the U.S., will only further accelerate this trend and for the U.S., generate a contestable space of GBP 1.5 billion this May.</p><p>In addition to this positive industry trend, we are also doing a lot of things to improve the vaping margins. And there are 2 areas that specifically stand out. One is the retail margins. On average, vaping retail margins are around 40% as compared to roughly 11% for cigarettes. This is because the category was created by many small players. Now obviously, our increased skill with powerful global brands will help us to manage the retail margins. But we're also working for various reasons to convert more of our user base on to a D2C platform, so onto our e-commerce, including through subscriptions. And this will also help us to personalize and customize our consumer communication, and we can sell a much wider range of liquids through e-commerce. And you may know, this has been a key driver of the success historically of open systems.</p><p>Another key opportunity is really in the cartridge cost. A quite shocking fact is that the liquids in our cartridges account for only 7% of the total cost. So we are now fully automated -- automating our cartridge manufacturing. So ePen 3, we fully automated last quarter, and next quarter, we're doing the same for ePod. This will drive very significant savings.</p><p>And next quarter, we're doing the same for ePod. This will drive very significant savings. And further margin improvement will also come from consolidating our portfolio. Behind 1 leading global brand, Vuse, are 2 winning superior platforms, but we're also, for instance, harmonizing our global liquid portfolio. Behind the best liquids that we had in the portfolio, and they will all be produced in 1 factory in Poland. So how is all of this now translating into our performance? Well, we are truly winning everywhere. And this is the U.S., the most important market, where we are consistently getting more consumers into our brands. If you look at the last period, 65% of all new device kits that were sold were from Vuse. And as a result, we have been consistently growing share in the last 6 months, tripling our Alto share and doubling our Vuse share over that 6-month period. Now in the state of Georgia, we tested a new marketing model that yielded even better success and no surprise that we will be replicating key elements of this model now nationwide. Our PMTA submissions are on track, and frankly, our portfolio is very well positioned for success in this environment. Unlike our competition, as you can see from this data, we clearly have no issue with under-age users, and we're also successfully building a portfolio of lower nicotine strength products. Canada is a very similar story, where we have had the highest device share in the last 6 months. And as a result, we are consistently, every single month, growing share at the expense of the market leader.</p><p>Then on to Europe, where we are the clear market leader. Like in France, where a year ago, we were still neck-to-neck with myblu, but now, we are more than twice their size. In October, we launched ePod, and you can see how this further accelerated our share momentum. The same counts for the U.K., where our total share is actually close to 40%, but this is just showing the Vype share at 12%. And it's important to note that in the U.K., only from May, we will be rolling out ePod at scale. And you have seen how this has helped us to accelerate our share momentum in France. Also in Germany, we have clearly now overtaken myblu to achieve market leadership, and we're almost 3x the size of (inaudible). So we are the clear leader, truly actually in all European markets, all the way from Poland to the Netherlands. So in summary, we are building the world's best vapor business with a superior portfolio of award-winning products and a powerful brand supported by award-winning marketing campaigns. We're leading in Europe, and we're becoming the very strong #2 in North America. So we are well poised to become the vapor leader globally, and we are improving our profitability at the same time. Now on to Modern Oral. We are already the global leader in Modern Oral, but we aspire to skill this category to its true global potential, that we believe will be very large. So we are the global leader, both in volume but also in value, given our strength in Europe. And we believe that this category has the potential to be very large. There is a massive advantage of not needing a device, that takes, for instance, away the cash outlay or trial, and therefore, makes the category more accessible for developing in emerging markets. And this is the only category that offers through discretion. You can't see when you're using it and you can truly use it anywhere and any time. So increasingly, we start selling a lot of these products in airlines as well. As satisfaction levels are universally high for this category, and we have therefore, very high conversion rates, especially amongst millennials and adult Gen-Z. But the commercial model is also very attractive. With margins per unit on average, 2.8x what we make out of cigarettes. And this is without a large upfront device cost. So we see a large global potential. We expanded last year to 17 countries. And our costs is strong, but from a low base. So we are working hard to grow this category in its existing markets, and obviously, we will be expanding to new markets as well. Now we do have a portfolio gap in the United States, as we only have 2 and 4 milligram nicotine variants and also a more limited flavor range. But we are doing well in the segment where we are focused on, and this is the fastest-growing segment in the market, and we have an opportunity to address our portfolio gap through future submissions to the FDA. But since our launch, we have been the fastest-growing brand in the United States, since we launched last July. So we don't have really a product performance issue. Based on our research, our product is actually superior to the competition at the same nicotine strength, and we are therefore enjoying very good conversion levels. But we're clearly doing very well elsewhere as well and probably, the thing that excites us most is the pilots that we did last year in Pakistan and Kenya because they demonstrate the true potential in the developing emerging markets, where more than 60% of our business is based today, and of course, where most of the world population is living as well. And we are very, very pleased with the results that we got out of Pakistan and Kenya. So as you know, we will be migrating, where legally possible, all our Modern Oral brands to Velo, and we are very confident in the future of Velo. We also have a great track record in migration. We successfully migrated over 100 brands in the last decade. And we have some outstanding products. Today, outside of the U.S., we have a unique and patented nicotine delivery system, which is clearly a major competitive advantage, but we're working on more. We will soon be introducing another unique and patented upgrade with longer-lasting flavors, and this is a clear unmet need into the categories. And we are working on a lot of exciting packaging innovation, for instance, to make the product more portable. So our focus will be on scaling our leadership in Modern Oral to build this category to its true global potential, leveraging our superior patented technologies and of course, a single global brand in Velo. So we have a strong foundation. We will be scaling, as I mentioned, our leadership in Modern Oral to build this category to its full potential. We are building the world's best vaping business, and we aim to emerge as a strong #2 in tobacco heating products through addressing our competitiveness. But as I mentioned in the beginning, we also see a mid to long-term opportunity that we want to explore beyond nicotine. And this is all around this consumer space that we call FLOW. So this segment is particularly largest amongst adult Gen Z and millennials. These consumers are still looking for ways to manage their flow, their energy levels during the day. But they want to use more natural ingredients that are better for you, and we think we are very well positioned to come up with some breakthrough offers for these consumers, but we will do that in a very disciplined way, focused on leveraging our core capabilities. For instance, we are covering more retail outlets globally in the markets where we operate than any other consumer product company. But we will also leverage our superior delivery platforms. So let me just explain why we believe that, that is such an important competitive advantage. Because there is a reason why cigarettes historically have always been so successful. Any active ingredient that is delivered through the buccal or the aerosol system is simply far more effective. You straight away get the impact, or you enjoy the impact immediately. You can use less of the active as well, and you can control a lot better how much you want to consume. So for any active, for instance, CBD to caffeine, this is a more effective way to satisfy consumers. So our initial focus is really on 2 areas. One is them -- one of them is our consumer foresights. So we see 3 very attractive consumer spaces, where we're doing more work on: Focus, boost and calm or relaxation. Secondly, we're doing some early work on the science, and here, we really follow 3 important principles: We will not mix any of these potentially new actives with nicotine; we will utilize the wide signs in terms of product safety, and of course, the efficacy of the products, but all of this is still very much in an exploratory space. So in summary, the growth of the new category helps to sustain higher levels of industry revenue growth. And we as BAT, we're building the wide capabilities to emerge as a clear winner in this industry transformation. We are step-by-step closing our gap in Tobacco Heating Products to emerge as a strong #2. We are already winning in all vapor markets and building the world's best vapor business. And we are leveraging our leadership in Modern Oral to scale this category to its full potential. And we're also now starting to explore these midterm opportunities beyond nicotine. So we are confident, I am confident, that we can deliver the GBP 5 billion revenue by 2023 and 2004 (sic) [2024] despite some of our severe headwinds this year. Thank you very much. I'd now like to hand over to Chris Sijtsma, who will take you through our core business, our combustible business.</p><p>CHRIS SIJTSMA;GROUP HEAD, COMBUSTIBLES: Thanks very much, Paul. My name is Chris Sijtsma, and I'm the Group Head of Combustibles. Today, I will present the role of combustibles within the context of our new strategy, and how combustible underpins sustainable value growth. And here are my key messages. The objective for the combustible category is to drive for sustainable revenue growth with continued volume share and value share growth. We will continue to develop and invest in our brands for equity and future value by offering winning brand and product propositions enabled by purposeful innovation. And this is underpinned by a hard drive to accelerate the delivery of efficiencies. We will further consolidate our portfolio of strategic brands and deliver efficiencies through a much leaner portfolio with far fewer SKUs designed to a margin. Revenue growth management is a critical enabler to lock -- unlock future value and our resource allocation will be focused and prioritized to deliver better results with fewer initiatives. Over the past 3 years, combustible duty paid industry volumes have declined at a CAGR of 3.6%. However, industry revenues, they've grown at 1.1%. BAT has grown its revenues from combustibles at the rate 2.5x the industry average and at a CAGR of 2.8%. With further momentum in 2019, when we grew revenues from combustibles with 4.6%. In 2019, we've grown our group volume share and our group value share with 20 basis points, with 70 basis point share growth for our strategic brand portfolio.</p><p>This chart shows the price mix for BAT for 2018 and 2019. The reason for the revenue acceleration in 2019 is an improved geographic mix. Out-performance has been delivered in the market with total consumption down, moderately down, at a CAGR of 2.3%. And here, total consumption means the consumption of duty-paid cigarettes plus the consumption of illegal cigarettes. Over the past few years, we've seen an acceleration in the growth of illegal cigarettes, putting some further pressure on duty-paid industry volumes. Due to the growth of illicit cigarettes, combustible duty-paid industry volumes have declined at a CAGR of 3.6%. The year started well in the United States. For the full year, we assume the U.S. cigarette market to be down by 5%. Globally, there may be some limited impact from the coronavirus. On balance and with our knowledge of today, we maintain our current outlook and our forecasting duty-paid industry volumes to decline with circa 4%. This is slightly worse than the historical rate of decline, due to significant excise increases in 2 low-value markets, Indonesia and Turkey. Aggregated performance, however, only tells a partial story. And to give you a flavor of the depth and breadth of our performance, I will now take you through our high value markets, the United States, Australia, Japan, Germany and Romania; 3 developing and emerging markets, Russia, Pakistan and Nigeria; and 3 markets, Malaysia, South Africa and Brazil, where the size of the illegal cigarette segment is very significant. And I will conclude with a few markets, we internally refer to as, our hidden gems. Together, these 50 markets represent 63% of our revenues and 42% of our volumes. They're all facing their own unique challenges and opportunities. But they have 1 important thing in common. In a majority of these markets, we grow revenues on the back of strong equity brand portfolio. 2019 was a good year for our U.S. business. Against a flattish volume share, we've grown our value share with 30 basis points. And this is important, we're growing in the right consumer and product segments. We've grown our share of premium with 50 basis points, our share of menthol with 70 basis points, and our share amongst 21 to 30-year-old smokers with 30 basis points. This performance has delivered revenue growth at a CAGR of 2.3%, with further momentum in 2019, where we grew revenues from combustibles with 3.8%. Our strong performance is a direct function of the strength of our brand portfolio. The chart shows the price elasticities for our strategic brands. The industry average price elasticity is minus 0.38, but with better, much better elasticities for Camel Crush, Newport menthol and Natural American Spirit. In terms of revenues, 67% of our revenues have a better-than-average industry price elasticity. 76 have an equal or better than industry ever price elasticity. Better elasticities translate into better volume performance. In 2019, the U.S. cigarette market was down with 5.3%. Natural American Spirit outperformed the market with 580 basis points, Newport with 310, and Camel Crush with 420 basis points.</p><p>Our strong performance among smokers between 21 and 30 years old is a further contributing factor to the price resilience of our brand portfolio. To conclude the U.S., despite the market volume decline, and because of the strength of our brand portfolio, the price resilience of our brands and the strong performance amongst 21 to 30 years old smokers, we're confident that we will continue to grow value for combustibles in the U.S.</p><p>Australia is one of the most regulated tobacco markets in the world. A retail display ban in plain packaging have been in place now for many years. And with prices for a pack of 25s averaging at GBP 17, cigarette prices in Australia are amongst the highest in the world. In 2017, we've seen a sharp market volume contraction due to excise tax increases. And over the past 3 years, combustible duty-paid industry volumes have declined at a CAGR of 5%. But we are performing well. We have a strong portfolio with high-equity brands. B&amp;H is the leader in the premium segment, Winfield is the #1 brand in the aspirational premium segment, and Pall Mall is a leading brand in low. By effective price laddering and by offering superior and differentiated smoking experiences, we've grown our share since January 2017 with 360 basis points. This performance has delivered revenue growth at a CAGR of 6% over the past 3 years. And Australia shows and demonstrates that also in highly regulated markets, we can deliver sustainable revenue growth. With 77% of consumption in combustibles and 23% in tobacco heated products, Japan is a true multi-category market. Nicotine industry volumes, over the past 3 years have declined at a CAGR of 3%, with combustibles declining at 9%. We're performing well. We've grown our THP share with 64 basis points, our cigarette share with 102 basis points, driven by strong performances of Lucky Strike and Kool. Across the 2 categories, we've grown share with 170 basis points. And this compares with share declines for our 2 key competitors with 50 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively. We've had strong revenue growth over the past 3 years at a CAGR of 23%. In 2019, the cigarette market declined with 8%. In contrast to that, we've grown volumes with 7% and revenues with 14%. Germany is a stable market with combustible duty-paid industry volumes moderately declining at a CAGR of 2%. With Lucky Strike in premium and Pall Mall in value segment, we have a strong and consolidated portfolio of brands. And over the past 3 years, BAT Germany has grown revenue from combustibles at a CAGR of 9%. One of the very few growing markets in Europe is Romania. Over the past 3 years, combustible duty-paid industry volumes have grown at a CAGR of 3%. And on the back of a very strong brand portfolio, with Dunhill in premium, Kent at mainstream pricing, and Pall Mall in the value segment, we're holding close to 60% share of the market. Over the past 3 years, we've grown revenues from combustibles with 13%. Let me now continue with the developing and emerging markets. Over the past 7 years, combustible industry volumes in Russia have been consistently declining as the government progressively increased excise tax on cigarette. Today, the tax incidence on cigarettes is 65%, and this has resulted in market contraction, in the growth of the consumption of illegal cigarettes and market down trading. As a consequence of this, our revenues from combustibles in 2019 were down by 10%. With excise on cigarettes normalized, we expect the outlook for the Russian market to improve. We're well positioned for that. We've had strong share growth, driven by our strategic brands, in particular, by Rothmans. Due to excise tax changes, industry volumes in Pakistan have been fluctuating. Net-net, and over the past 3 years, combustible duty-paid industry volumes have grown at a CAGR of 7%. We've had strong share growth driven by outstanding performance of Pall Mall. And today, we are holding a category share of close to 75%. Over the past 3 years, Pakistan has grown revenues from combustibles at a CAGR of 8%. Nigeria is one of the most important markets in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past 3 years, combustible duty-paid volumes have been gradually growing at a CAGR of 1.5%. With category-leading brands like B&amp;H, Rothmans and Pall Mall, we're holding a strong and growing consumer share. Over the past 3 years, we've grown our revenues at a CAGR of 10%. I will now continue with 3 other markets: Malaysia, South Africa and Brazil. In these 3 markets, the size of the Illegal cigarette segment is very significant. And as we're holding shares between 55 and in excess of 75% in South Africa, reverting illegal cigarettes back into the duty-paid market represents a real and significant value opportunity. Malaysia, however, is not a great story. Total consumption is 20 billion sticks with 64% of that in illegal cigarettes. As we are the market leader, this development mostly impacted BAT. And in 2019, our revenues were down with 90%. But things can turn around very quickly, which takes me to South Africa. So Africa needs an introduction. There's always been a certain level of illegal cigarettes in the South African market, but things really spiraled out of control, when these traders started building factories in South Africa mainland, manufacturing billions of cigarettes without paying a penny of excise tax. Total consumption of the South African market is 37 billion sticks, half of that is in illegal cigarettes. A few years back, we started a very aggressive campaign to attack illegal cigarettes, take back the tax. And we started getting traction for the issue, so much so that in mid-2019, the illegal manufacturers were forced to raise their prices. At the same time, we modernized our brands, we (inaudible) our brands. And after years of decline, in 2019, we're growing volumes again with combustible revenue growth of 4%. Another market that's significantly impacted by illegal cigarettes is Brazil. Total consumption is 116 billion, with more than half, 55% to be precise, is in illegal cigarettes. Amid this turmoil, we embarked on a very ambitious journey to migrate a brand of local brands to our strategic brands. This journey started in 2009, where we migrated Carlton to Dunhill. That was followed by the migration of Free to Kent in 2017, and in 2019, we migrated another significant local brand, Derby to Kent as well. And at the same time, we consolidated our local low price brands into Rothmans. Today, our strategic brands have a volume contribution of 72%. We have a much better portfolio, with much better equity, ready to recapture volume from the illegal cigarette segment. In 2019, we slowed down the growth of the illegal cigarette market. We slowed down our volume decline. And BAT Brazil has grown revenues from combustibles with 6%. Hidden gems are markets that may not necessarily be top of mind. They're smaller in terms of their volume contribution, but they are very profitable. On the chart, you see 4 examples, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Norway. Year, on year, on year, these markets deliver revenue growth contributing to the group's results. So far, my market update, I showed you 50 markets, they're all facing their own unique challenges and opportunities. But as I said, they have 1 important thing in common, and a majority of them consistently grow revenues backed by a very strong portfolio of high-equity brands. We will continue to develop and invest our brands for equity and future value. By offering winning brand and product experiences enabled by purposeful innovation. Today, I will briefly touch on the performance of our strategic brand portfolio. Together, our 8 brands represent GBP 53 billion in terms of consumer spend, in terms of consumer price turnover. A brand like Pall Mall, in terms of consumer spend, is comparable to the global spend on a brand like Pepsi. The consumer spend on Kent is comparable to the global spend on Diet Coke. And the spent on Newport is comparable to Cadbury. Our brands are significant, they're sizable and they're performing well. We now have 8 years of consistent group volume share growth behind us. And over the past 3 years, since January 2017, we've grown our group volume share with 70 basis points. This is driven by stellar performance of our strategic brands, which have grown 310 basis points over that same period. In 2019, we've grown 6 of our 8 strategic brands. And we're growing in the right segments. The mega trend in combustibles is consideration. Non-full flavor, products that offer more considerate smoking experience. Slimmer, products with a circumference thinner than regular King Size. And fraction stimulation, products that offer an exciting flavor experience are all different expressions of consideration. On the chart, you see the share growth of each of these 3 product segments. And our share of that growth. We're punching above our weight by taking more than our fair share of the segment growth. I will conclude with our efficiency agenda, portfolio consolidation, portfolio rationalization, revenue growth management and resource allocation. BAT has always been a multi-brand company, but it doesn't mean that scale is not important. Back in 2004, and with a volume of 128 billion sticks, our Strategic Brands, accounted for 90% of our total volume. Today, the Strategic Brands volume contribution is 64%, and our ambition for the next few years is to take it significantly beyond that. And we will do this as follows: we will continue to organically grow our Strategic Brands. And where opportune, migrate local brands to one of our Strategic Brands; secondly, for some of our local brands, we adopted a shadowing concept, meaning that we take the brand mix of a Strategic Brand and apply that very same mix to a local brand to make the management of these brands simpler and more effective. We will go a lot further in this than what we've done so far; and finally, there will always be a tail of local brands that cannot be migrated for whatever reason. For these brands, we will develop a common chassis, a range of standardized brand and product expressions again, to make the management of these brands simpler and more efficient. Over the past few years, we significantly reduced complexity of our business by reducing our SKU count by 10%. In 2019, we agreed to make a real step-change and complexity reduction, with a further SKU count reduction of 25% from the basis of quarter 2019. Now this will have many benefits across our primary and secondary supply chains, but most importantly, and at retail, it will create a space for expanding our new category assortments. And we design our SKUs to a margin. The principle is simple, we developed a framework of flexible brand standards, allowing high-margin markets to adopt a high-end product spec, giving low-margin markets a flexibility to go for a lower-end product spec. This is all within clearly defined quality standards and parameters. In a mature category like combustibles, revenue growth management is absolutely key. It's about building a digitally-enabled, analytics and insights capability to execute pricing as effective as possible to optimize assortments and trade investments. Over the next 18 months, we will progressively build this capability in our high-value markets. I talked about the importance of the 3 product segments: non full flavor; slimmer; and freshness and stimulation. In 2019, 88% of our new brand launches were against these 3 product segments. By better focusing, by better targeting, we reduced the number of new brand launches since 2016 with 60%, but we are achieving better results. We call a new brand launch successful if it achieves half its share within 12 months time. Historically, our success rate was 26%, but in 2019, and with a success rate of 56%, we're setting a new industry standard. Altogether, the new brand launches contributed 1.4 percentage points to our group volume share, representing GBP 700 million in terms of revenues, which is 70% of our revenue growth. The objective of our efficiency agenda is to improve the revenue to gross margin conversion. On the chart, you see the progression of revenues and gross margins for our strategic brands since 2017, with 2017 indexed at 100. We've grown revenues at a CAGR of 5.2%. But more importantly, gross margins ahead of that at a CAGR of 8.7%. By further consolidating our portfolio, by rationalizing the tail of our portfolio, for our framework of flexible brand standards, the revenue growth management capability we are building and through focus and prioritize resource allocation, we are confident that we will continue to grow gross margins ahead of revenues. That takes me to the end of my presentation, and let me summarize. Over the past 3 years, industry volumes have declined at a CAGR of 3.6%. Revenues, however, have grown at 1.1%. We have grown revenues at a CAGR of 2.8%, but with further momentum in 2019, where we grew revenues with 4.6%. For the next few years, we have a few, very simple priorities. Our objective is to drive for sustainable revenue growth with continued volume share and value share growth. We will continue to develop and invest in our brands for equity and future value. And this is underpinned by a hard drive for efficiencies. Thanks very much. Thanks for listening, and let me hand over to Marina. Thank you.</p><p>MARINA BELLINI, DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL &amp; INFORMATION AND MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C.: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, good afternoon. I am Marina Bellini, Information and Digital Director, Chief Information and Digital Officer in the group since 2018. With over 20 years experience working across the globe, AB InBev, PepsiCo and PwC. Leading the digital agenda for BAT over the past 2 years has been very rewarding because strong results are being delivered and the opportunities ahead of us are also big, while leveraging technology in our business to deliver exponential value. In our strategy, Digital plays a key role in strengthening many capabilities across the organization, such as insights, consumer brands, innovation, and connecting ourselves internally and externally in an agile way. Our approach to Digital is to apply new technologies to existing and new business process to accelerate our results. Key principles we're following in this path are Digital being applied across the enterprise, big focus on consumer marketing and also way beyond it, in the entire value chain of BAT. Technology is the key enabler, and its exponential value comes to fruition when the organization has the skills, the ways of working and the culture of how to exploit it. Data and analytics is centered on how we manage technology in the group. Continuously challenging ourselves to bring automation, insights and foresights to drive sharper and differentiated decision-making inputs to our managers. The story that I'm excited to share with you is the following: digital has delivered in 2019. We are, for sure, not an old dinosaur as sometimes people see the tobacco industry. Here, technology has been applied in a meaningful and modern way and brought results to BAT. We know how to drive change, this has started and is accelerating at pace. The group's priorities of combustible value growth, step change in new categories and simplification of the company are powered by new technologies. We have an ambitious plan, and we are on track to achieve it. And this is, and will always be then guaranteeing and stable, efficient and secure technology stack, building on our strong foundations, addressing GDPR, Cyber and overall compliance requirements such as Chip, TPD, SOx and many others. In 2019, strong results were delivered in BAT leveraging Digital. Over 25 million consumers, of which 7 million are new categories that we have in our database, and we are communicating with on their journey of migrating to, and engaging with, reduced-risk products. Our 88,000 farmers and almost 700 tobacco-leaf technicians are supported by a mobile solution that allow us to have crop-yield estimation, track sustainability metrics, transact contracts all real time, bringing efficiency and accuracy to the process. 0.5 billion of packaging materials inventory is constantly optimizing, enabled by advanced analytic tools. It has allowed for 5% reduction of this working capital item. Through robotics, analytics, several new technologies and external partnerships, we've delivered over GBP 40 million in efficiency, in shared service and IT. While launching a digital expertise program that has already covered over 1,000 senior managers in the group.</p><p>Strong resources and plans were put in place behind strengthening the technology and the digital team. And we have skilled resources in our markets. And in our 4 tech hubs in Poland, Malaysia, Mexico and the U.S., and we are setting up our innovation labs in San Francisco, London and Tel Aviv, to further develop external partnerships that can accelerate our journey, building a better tomorrow. With the new employer branding, BAT's purpose and vision and the digital transformation plans, we were able to hire over 100 people from top companies of many different industries, such as Pharma, Big Tech, Fintech, FMCG. While we're improving on the diversity of our teams, over 30% women, more than 60 nationalities, and people with very diverse professional experiences in BAT and from outside. Key skills are being [raised] in the group, such as design thinking, disruptive technologies and data sciences. Training and on-the-job learning, and it's not only about skilling up our people, but also about building strong partnerships that bring experience and value to the group at speed with partners such as McLaren and Salesforce. To deliver digital transformation at scale in the group, our strategy is: First, to drive process to be data-centric. One example, using multiple data sources and AI for better informed pricing approach in Australia, with micro segmentation with discounting and portfolio defined at store level. Another example, using more and more real-time insights with social media, e-commerce, traditional and new methods of consumer research and many other data sources brought together to improve consumer engagement in the U.K., Italy and in Japan. In Japan, the engagement rate is up by 21%. Then we've trained the organization to use agile methodology and leveraged technology solutions globally and allowed for local differentiation that brings competitive advantage at speeds. One example is that we have over 10,000 trade reps worldwide in a single global technology platform that all average on a daily basis and gets activated by each market with the components that matters by differentiating the solutions that helps them win in each marketplace. And also another case, we have 6 million new category consumers, records in our global consumer relationship management platform. Deployed at speed in 19 markets, with solutions in different channels, in line with each market opportunity, regulation and experience in countries such as Japan, U.S. And the U.K. and using these records, we have sent over 90 million personalized messages last year.</p><p>Third, our strategy pulls value from a structured innovation process, connecting many new external partners, Big Tech, entrepreneurs, VCs. To deliver a solution, for example, like we are piloting Chile, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil, to have an Uber-like network to deliver to our trade partners, reducing logistics costs potentially by 5% to 30% and achieving greater than 99% delivery on time. Great case is also driving consumer research, not on 8 months time frame, but 8 weeks, as we just did in the U.S. and Japan for new actives. An innovative solutions on age gating, they are being piloting and looking very promising for retail and e-commerce. Last, we are embedding digital in BAT's DNA. Specific training for marketers, technologists, HR, legal, finance people in digital marketing. Digital immersion programs for our senior leadership and Squads, mission based teams, in Canada, Mexico and Japan, successful delivering on New Categories growth. Supporting our combustible value growth priority, we have improved our B2B revenue 5x in 2019, freeing up costs and time from our sales team to support higher performance of our trade partners. We've created analytics models as part of the plan to fight illicit trade in Brazil and we're able to bring back to the duty paid part of the market, 1.8 billion sticks. We are now investing to grow our B2B channel and better serve our trade partners, leveraging our global trade platform that enables for multichannel and multi-category route to market, and continue expanding analytics and execution solution to support micro segmentation to price and portfolio manage our offers.</p><p>Digital has been critical to the acceleration of New Categories. In 2019, we grew by 3.5x the number of followers in social media. We achieved 7 million consumers of new categories in our database that we engage regular with. And moving forward, we will continue to deliver on the growth via direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales, improving margin, experience and services. We are going to grow the consumer database and the personalization of messages with each one of them to continue to expand their understanding and engagement within noncombustible products. And as it's just happening today, in Oxford Street here in London, our BAT Vapor retail stores will offer a unique shopping experience, connecting all consumer touch points. Delivering on the priority of simplifying BAT was achieved through change in organization and process, as mentioned before by my colleagues, but also by the exploitation of technology at scale. Automating back office process and achieving in billing, pricing and some other activities, up to 90% reduction in processing time. And reducing by circa 30% the energy consumption of our data centers. With higher complexity in our supply chain, given the increased portfolio in new categories, concurrent planning is coming live in Australia, Brazil, Japan and the U.K. this year that allows for a more responsible and flexible operation. Leveraging IoT in our tobacco leaf operations will bring speed and a more precise quality differentiation, and increasing the number of bots in our organization, you further deliver efficiency to the group. We are on track to deliver on our ambitions plans to be amongst the most technology-enabled FMCGs. We aim to have 25 million new category consumers in our database that we engage with in an individual way. We will have personalized products as we grow in understanding of individual preferences and can customize accordingly, weighing to have almost zero touch factors running at maximum efficiency and flexibility. And a workforce that focuses on value-added activities and a bot workforce that delivers on the transactional and repetitive tasks, we will be top quartile on Cyber security, we will be top quartile on digital quotient. We are going to be not only amongst the best companies to work for overall, as we already are today, but also the best companies to work for millennials and Gen Zs. We will be amongst the most tech-enabled FMCGs globally. This is an exciting story of digital having delivered in 2019, an organization that knows how to drive change and leverage technology at scale, supporting our priorities and delivering against our very ambitious plans. Now I will hand over to Jack for closing remarks. Thank you.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Thank you, Marina. So we have covered a lot of grounds today. I'm sure you will agree with me that our foundations are strong. As I said in my opening presentation, we are very fortunate that ours is a business that is one of the most resilient in these difficult times. The welfare of our employees and our stakeholders remains our priority. However, despite the challenges that we are facing due to the corona Pandemic, to date, we have seen no material impact in our business. Today, we have shown you that we are resilient and have consistently delivered against our financial guidance, and we delivered again in 2019. And while we do not know what the future may hold, at present, we are maintaining our guidance for 2020 with 3% to 5% revenue growth, high single figure EPS growth and continue to deleverage the balance sheet. We have an ambition to build a better tomorrow by reducing the health impact of our business through offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products to our consumers. Our strategy is clear, and we know we have to win and how to win, and we are building capabilities across the organization that we need to support our growth. As an organization that is bold, fast, empowered, diverse and responsible, we have the right culture to accelerate our delivery. The strategy I've outlined to date underpins our confidence to continue delivering revenue growth of 3% to 5%, with GBP 1 billion of savings in efficiencies over the next 3 years. This allows us to deliver on our financial commitment and make substantial further investment in the growth of the New Category business and continue to deliver the deleveraging of the balance sheet. While also delivering on our stretching new ESG ambitions. In summary, we're a resilient business and remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to high-single figure EPS growth in the future. Thank you. And I will now open to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: [Operator Instruction] And our first question comes from the line of Nico Von Stackelberg from Liberum.</p><p>NICO VON STACKELBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, LIBERUM CAPITAL LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just wanted to ask about pricing in some of your key markets. So I know last year was a very strong year with pricing -- price mix of 9%. Can you tell me a little bit more about where the pricing will come from this year? And how you see the geographic mix playing into this?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, thank you very much for your question. I think what's very important to realize is that the springboard that we have coming out of 2019 is a very strong one. That gives us the ability to deliver on our numbers for the year. Yet, of course, there is the coronavirus, which is going to be an unknown as we go along. But yet to date, we didn't see any major impact on our business moving forward. So I think that this is going to be the biggest impact, the biggest risk, but we are a very resilient industry, and we are a very successful company in that industry.</p><p>NICO VON STACKELBERG: Okay. And my next question is on next-generation products. I'm just wondering, can you tell me what percent is repeat purchase versus how much is merely pipeline still? Or how do you break that down internally? And can you put some numbers around it, please?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, what's important -- thank you very much. What's important is that most of our volume is not related to pipeline filling because we had very little launches at the end of the year. So most of our volume is effectively genuine volumes coming through. Because as you saw in the presentation of Paul Lageweg, we have an acceleration in terms of share, both in the 3 categories, and that will continue in the months to come. What we see very clearly is a very strong springboard in Q4, and that will continue to help us for delivering our numbers for 2020.</p><p>NICO VON STACKELBERG: Excellent. Final question, please. On the next -- on the beyond nicotine category, so I assume it's something around cannabis, CBD, [eutrophics] and so forth. But could you just tell me a little bit more about which segments you find economically attractive. So I've seen a number of heavyweights in the industry really suffering recently. I really question the economics of some of these categories. Could you give us a bit more confidence that some of these categories will prove profitable and attractive for shareholders in the long run?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. First of all, what you have to remember is that we have 3 categories today, and these 3 categories are going very well. We grew by 32% last year. Now we have still a lot of ground to cover and a lot of space for growth and a lot of potential in these 3 categories as they exist today. But nonetheless, we're going to go further and beyond that on the midterm, long term. So we have time for that. First, what is very important is to have the right scientific understanding, coupled with consumer insights that we have across the 3 categories. And then as we said during the presentation, it is going to be, first, focusing on the different platforms of delivery that we have. And that makes absolute sense for us. We don't want to spread ourselves thin. What we want to is to build from a strong foundations with a very clear framed approach in terms of science in order to make sure that we are successful. So that's for the long term.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett from Jefferies.</p><p>OWEN MICHAEL BENNETT, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions, please. Firstly, on the vape performance, there was no mention of iSwitch. I was hoping maybe you could comment on what's happening with this product and the future plans. And then secondly, you've spoken about the improvement driven in Japan by pro and nano, I was just wondering when can we expect these to be rolled out beyond Japan?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. So the first question, as Paul said in his presentation, what we're doing is we're refocusing our portfolio in terms of number of SKUs, but also in terms of number of devices. What we have for the time being is 2 very successful ones. That are ePen 3 and Alto. We are successful -- extremely successful with these 2 platforms and certainly very successful in the U.S. So we'll continue to push on these platforms. What is important is that we have the focus related to the different platforms. And the second question was, sorry?</p><p>OWEN MICHAEL BENNETT: Just on the ePen in Japan by pro and nano. I was just wondering when they may be rolled out beyond Japan?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, it's a very good question. What we do always is we, I would say, concept proof the launches that we have, and we've done that in Japan. These 2 platforms are working very well for the reasons explained by Paul during the presentation. And gradually, looking at resource allocation and looking at MAPS and looking at the consumers, we will expand these launches through the year. What is very important to us is the new launch that we're going to have in the next few weeks. And that is going to be extremely important for us because it has 30% more tobacco and it has also boost button, and it has also larger heating surface that allows us to put more tobacco and to have more flavor coming out of it, thus increasing the satisfaction to the consumer. We had some gaps, and we're going to continue to push on that, and we're closing the gaps.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Sanath Sudarsan from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>SANATH SUDARSAN, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can I ask 2 quick questions, please? One, can you please help us understand better the level of migration of current smokers into NGP? You have set a target about 50 million consumers in a decade. How big a share of the NGP market do you expect this to be? And where is the category sourcing consumers from in your view? That's question number one. And question number two, can you give us much more insight on the level of pricing power you still have in many of these markets? Given from the data you showed on combustibles, pricing has remained very strong across even mature market. So longer term, over the next 5, 10 years, how do you see the pricing evolve?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, I mean, first of all, I don't have a crystal ball. But what we see is that there is a strong pricing that has happened in 2019. What we see at the beginning of the year, with 65% of our pricing that was planned that went through, it means that there is pricing opportunities moving forward. The second element is what Chris Sijtsma spoke about, which is the fact that our pricing elasticity numbers are very good, especially in the U.S. and it gives us a lot of space to grow. At the end of the day what is important is the adequation of the pricing and the speed at which the pricing is taken, and at the same time, the affordability to the consumer. So I think that we're in a good position looking forward, but it's very difficult to plan further and beyond the 2 years to come. The first question was? Sorry.</p><p>SANATH SUDARSAN: Sorry. Just in case -- in terms of your NGP number you set out for a decade, you want to be near 50 million consumers. So how big a share of the consumers of NGP do you expect that to be? And where do you expect to source these consumers into the market? Are they coming from smoking? Are these new consumers? How do you think that evolves?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. First of all, mostly, they will come from smokers. What we said is we want to have a health footprint that is reduced and that will give us a more sustainable and a more, I would say, dynamic company. So that's the first point. The second point is the migration will happen gradually. We thought 2 years ago that there will be 1 category. That's what the industry thought. Now we know that there are 3 categories. We thought that the consumer was a bit monolithic. You saw through Paul's presentation that it's a very dynamic environment with a lot of consumers. Our insights are telling us much more, but we know that these categories will continue to evolve. Why? Consumer acceptance; two, satisfaction, but also regulation and price and excise. So these 3 categories will develop differently as we go along. What is important is because we have a portfolio of 3 categories, we're more immune in a way to the development that are coming. And we will be making sure because we have an agile organization and agile ways of planning our business and a very strong new organization with new capabilities, we will be able to navigate better all these developments of these different categories. We want to have the 50 million consumers because this is important to us.</p><p>SANATH SUDARSAN: Jack, just to follow-up on that, so those 2 questions together. So how much do you think price could be a variable pushing consumers out of smoking into NGP or accelerating that shift?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, I think you have to come back to Chris Sijtsma's presentation on that one, which is you saw, for instance, in Australia, where the prices are very high, average price is around GBP 17. The consumers are reducing in number, but the value of the market is increasing. What I'm interested in, and that's what I said in the 3 priorities I outlined 1 year ago, is that on combustibles, I'm going after value. I don't want to lose my shot, of course, in terms of share, and we grew share last year. But the most important is the value. And I think that there's still a lot of space in terms of pricing for the future.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Leinster from Societe Generale.</p><p>JONATHAN STEPHEN LEINSTER, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: A couple of questions, if I may. First one, with regards to the Modern Oral segment, you're sort of industry leader on that, particularly in Europe. When you talk to regulators about this market, what are their concerns regarding Modern Oral? And what are you looking for in terms of the sort of regulatory outlook for that segment?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: I think it's a very good question and a very fundamental question. What we want to have, as we said last year, is a clear regulatory framework in each of these different categories. That Modern Oral category is developing very fast, yet we're trying to follow systematically with the regulatory framework that is discussed and engaged with the different governments in the different countries in order to make sure that we're on the right side of the regulatory framework to ensure -- as we do a lot in terms of science, to ensure the quality of our products and that the overall competitive environment is not only a level playing field, but also, I would say, a secure environment for our consumers. So we go step-by-step, yet, at the same time, Modern Oral, as was said, is a very good way of recapturing consumer moments about the -- for the consumers in the different countries. That gives us the possibility to expand quite fast. And by the way, we have no limitations at the moment in terms of capacity of production. We have patents, we have good products, and we'll continue to deliver these good products. As Paul said, we are starting to sell in airlines and that's a very good sign in terms of the potential expansion of the different categories.</p><p>JONATHAN STEPHEN LEINSTER: Okay. And secondly, on the heated, just to be clear on the heated tobacco segment, you seem to indicate that the focus this year outside of Japan was going to be very much on Eastern Europe rather than Western Europe. Is that broadly correct? Is Western Europe relegated to a relatively minor role because it's a high tar market?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: I would answer that question first by saying that it's quite a sensitive competitive information that you're asking me. So I'm not going to answer directly your question. But the second thing is, I think that we have some launches that are going to happen this year in H1. We have some launches that have happened in quarter 4 last year. We're taking the learnings because we have insights on the 4 categories, and we'll continue to expand our footprint in the right way moving forward.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Alicia Forry from Investec.</p><p>ALICIA ANN FORRY, CONSUMER ANALYST, INVESTEC BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jack, 2 questions from me. One on the vapor product consolidation. I'm curious why you've chosen to consolidate behind the Vuse brand. You put up a lot of charts showing how Vype has outperformed a bit more strongly in Europe than Vuse has in North America. Perhaps if you could discuss that? And also, it seems like consumers of these products are quite fragmented and everyone want something different from it. So can you explain how one brand umbrella can really satisfy all of those various needs of the consumer, please? And then secondly on menthol...</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Can I start with this one?</p><p>ALICIA ANN FORRY: Yes, of course.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Okay. So first, thank you very much. First of all, vapor very important. It was an extremely fragmented market. Now it is consolidating. So we have more focus on one major brand, and we took the decision of that brand against that one because we knew that the different capabilities that we have related to that brand, the consumer resonance and the way we can market in the different markets allowed us to take that brand, which is Vuse, and to put it everywhere. At the same time, what we're going to do is to reduce the number of SKUs, to reduce the number of flavors that we have and to have a more consequent approach in terms of the financials and a more radical approach in terms of concentration.</p><p>ALICIA ANN FORRY: Okay. And on menthol, we haven't touched too much on it here today, but it does seem to be under a lot of attack from various legislative bodies at varying levels of the government in the U.S. If we assume that this pressure on the segment continues and possibly could even worsen, what is BAT's strategy for the possibility of transitioning to a menthol-free U.S. market in the future? What can you say about your preparations for that possibility?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. Thank you very much. Very good question. It is true that menthol has been a bit of the agenda recently. It has been very high on the agenda in the last 2 years. Nonetheless, nothing has changed. Why? Because there is no scientific evidence that makes any difference at the moment. There is no piece of information that says that it is going to go further in terms of scientific evidence. We do strongly believe that menthol should be in the market. And we see in the U.S. that even for vapor products, you are still allowed to use menthol products. First, you have to remember that even for combustible business, first of all, consumers are smokers. Secondly, they are using a brand, and they are very proud, and they're very happy to use this brand. And thirdly, we have the strongest cohort in terms of the beyond 21 years old in terms of menthol. So I think that we have an extremely good resilience. There are markets, as you ask the questions, there are markets where menthol ban has already happened. Like, for instance, Canada. What has happened in Canada in 2017? Menthol was banned. What happened? Retention was 98%, and the consumers continue to use their own brands that they like and they enjoy. So I think that there is a lot of experience in BAT how to tackle these new environments. But also, I don't think that the risk is extremely high at the moment in terms of the U.S. In terms of Europe, you will have a menthol ban during the summer, and we are very well prepared in order to go through and to come out stronger out of that menthol ban.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain from Barclays.</p><p>GAURAV JAIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I have 3 questions. So question one is that some of the consumer stable categories, such as food products and hygiene products, are seeing a huge amount of pantry loading right now. Now this has led to a question whether consumers are taking money out of some other categories, such as tobacco, and whether consumers are down-trading. So can you please talk about what's happening in U.S. as well as also in Italy and Spain? That's my question one.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Okay. Let's start with that one issue, if I may. First of all, what's important is that we don't see any change in terms of patterns of consumers recent -- patterns of consumption recently. Why? Because cigarettes, to the opposite of a lot of other categories, is a daily purchase. So consumers continue to go to the shops. And even in Italy and in France, you still have the -- tobacco is open and consumers can continue to supply. So we don't see important stockage or building stocks from the consumers. It is much more the daily consumption that is happening, and that is continuing to happen. We didn't see any changes in the last 2 months in terms of that pattern.</p><p>GAURAV JAIN: Sure. That's very, very helpful. Question number two is, yesterday, the FDA passed the rule on graphic health warnings on cigarette packs in the U.S., and this has to be implemented next year. How do you think this will impact your business over the next 3 to 5 years?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: That's one. That's the -- I didn't hear your question. It's about the health warning in the U.S.?</p><p>GAURAV JAIN: Yes, the graphic health warning on cigarette packs in the U.S.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. I mean...</p><p>GAURAV JAIN: How will that impact your business?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Our position has always been the same. We are supporting of regulation. Yet that regulation has to be balanced regulation. So first of all, we have to see the content, and we are in close contact with the regulators in order to make sure that we have our voice at the table in order to make sure that, that regulatory framework is balanced. So we'll take the opportunities as we go along, as you said, that's going to be for the mid of 2021.</p><p>GAURAV JAIN: Sure. And last question, and this is for Tadeu. One of the initiatives earlier this year was that you will drive working capital savings through better inventory management, and I think you mentioned during your discussion on coronavirus that you are building up stocks. So do you think that inventory management initiative will get pushed out?</p><p>TADEU LUIZ MARROCO: I -- yes, I quoted that as one of many that we are doing in order to manage working capital, and it's not just about working capital, but CapEx as well. Remember that we made this commitment to reduce the CapEx to the level of depreciation. We see this on -- as a temporary measure. It's difficult to predict now exactly how long this will take. At the end, we are not expect to have a major impact in terms of working capital in our numbers. We proved the last 2 years that we have a very cash-generative company in terms of free cash flow. And our levels of conversion is very high in the 90s plus. So we don't expect to have any difference this year compared with the previous one, although in the next coming months, probably we'll have some drag coming from the working capital, which overall shouldn't be a big weight for the position of the group.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER, MD &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from me, please. The first on glo hybrid. How are you guys thinking about pricing, both on the device and the consumables? Will they be priced at a premium or purity to the legacy products?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: You're speaking about hybrid?</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER: Yes, please.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. So I mean, these are things -- it is exactly the model that I spoke about. We launched something in the market because we see an opportunity. We do believe that hybrid in specific markets, because of regulatory frameworks, is an interesting concept for the consumer. We have done a lot of research on it post, prior and during the launch. And we know, as Paul said in his presentation, that there's lot of things that we can improve. So that's an unknown category that we're discovering as we speak. We are the ones that are pioneering in that category, and we'll continue to do so, and we'll take the learnings and continue to expand.</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER: But sorry, just -- and I apologize if I'm misunderstanding something. It sounds like this is a new device. It's certainly a bigger, different consumable with 30% more tobacco. And so I'm just trying to understand, will this product be priced at a premium to the legacy glo products that are in the market or be priced on par?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Are you not confusing? I'm not sure. I'm trying to understand the question. Are you speaking about the hybrid with -- hyper or hybrid?</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER: Sorry. No, I apologize if I'm mischaracterizing it. Let me be just more clear. You've got slim consumables and now you have these new consumables that have 30% more tobacco. Will they be priced the same? Or will the larger consumables with 30% more tobacco be priced at a premium?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: So you're referring to hyper. Okay. Thank you very much.</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER: Oh, I'm sorry.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: No, no. No problem. No problem. So this is the consumable and the device that we're going to launch in a few weeks from now. I think this one is a very important one in our portfolio in terms of THP. Why? Because we know that the satisfaction index, and you can refer to the chart that was in Paul's presentation, the satisfaction index is extremely important. And we know that with the current products that are in the market at the moment, there is a gap in terms of satisfaction in all the markets that are not low tar. So what we've developed is a product where the consumable is bigger and thicker, closer to the format of a normal cigarette. First point. The second point is, it has 30% tobacco more, which allows you to give more flavor to the consumers with the risk-reduced product. And thirdly, there is more heating surface around the stick that allows you to heat better the tobacco and to get the satisfaction to the consumer. And lastly, there's a boost button on that device. So that should increase your level of satisfaction and the delivery to the consumer. So this is a breakthrough that we're going to launch in the next few weeks. In terms of pricing, it will depend on the different market situations in Asia and in the rest of the world in order to make sure that we have the best adequation and the best trial levels for the consumers.</p><p>VIVIEN NICOLE AZER: Okay. That's fine. As you think about the U.S. marketplace, clearly, your market share performance in 2019 was really quite healthy. And I appreciate your comments on price elasticity. But as you kind of think about the outlook for the U.S., there have certainly been some alarming predictions around what unemployment could become given COVID and the lockdowns that are happening in key cities. So how have you guys thought about the evolution of price elasticity to the extent that the macro landscape in the U.S. deteriorates pretty meaningfully?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. First of all, I think the important first point is that we see our situation or our position in the U.S. as extremely strong. We have the strongest brands. We have the strongest development in terms of the different categories that we operate in. And we have a better price elasticity coefficient than others. Our portfolio is extremely strong. As you said, our share is good and our value share is increasing quite significantly. So it will continue to go in the same direction. What we see now, looking at moving forward, is the first 2 months of the year the market has been 1% better than the same period last year, which is a good indication for the beginning of the year of the health of the industry in the U.S.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.</p><p>JEFFREY LARSEN KRATKY, RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER SANDLER &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Jeff Kratky, on for Michael. So beyond nicotine, would we infer correctly that cannabis and hemp are under consideration? And for any nonnicotine push, do you expect to use M&amp;A or launch products organically?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Okay. So there are 2 things. One is in terms of products for that next generation of products, we're looking at a variety of different stimulants. The list is long, and we are reviewing them all at the moment. And we're doing all the assessments that we need to do in the frame that we spoke about earlier in the presentation. What we have to make sure is that we understand the different factors related to the launches. And we have to make sure that this is health beneficial to our consumers moving forward. So we'll review in time and that's for midterm to long term, further and beyond what we have at the moment in the market.</p><p>TADEU LUIZ MARROCO: On the -- can I just compliment on the M&amp;A side, we are not expect to do any type of major acquisition in that space. We rather prefer to use our newly created corporate venture entity exactly to explore partnerships and joint ventures that would be interesting for us to develop the capabilities that we need to in that new space.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: I mean, I think it's a very important point that you're raising. In the future, you will see more and more partnerships with other companies in terms of either IP or technology or processes. And what we want to do is to own as much as possible the end-to-end in terms of the development and the launches of these products supported by third-parties. I think it is very important to us to own our future and to be able to leverage in the future.</p><p>JEFFREY LARSEN KRATKY: Got it. That's really helpful color. And just a quick follow-up on M&amp;A. You mentioned it as part of -- as a strength and part of your strategy. What level of leverage would you need to consider another large deal? Would that only be after going below 3x in 2021?</p><p>TADEU LUIZ MARROCO: Yes. We are fully committed, like I said several times in the past, that's to deleverage the company at this point in time. We don't envisage any substantial M&amp;A coming forward in the next short term or even midterm. We want to now focus on our corporate venture capital. Because to be honest, if you see what's happening in terms of M&amp;A in that space, they haven't been very successful independent of our current position. We think that we'll be better off leveraging the capabilities that we are building through the corporate venture, and like Jack said, trying to explore potential joint ventures and partnerships in the future, I think, that will be much more effective and efficient for us.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Pooja Gupta from Barclays.</p><p>POOJA GUPTA;BARCLAYS;PORTFOLIO LEAD: Pooja Gupta at Barclays. I was hoping that you could further build on some of your comments around actions you highlighted that are specific to the short-term to your COVID-19 response. For example, could you tell us a little bit about the tighter cash control measures that you're implementing? And then given some of the seasonal cash flow needs that you typically experience in the first half of the year, particularly around like MSA payments, do you anticipate having to need any -- do you anticipate having to need accessing any of the credit lines you have available to improve your liquidity position even if it's out of an abundance of caution at this point?</p><p>TADEU LUIZ MARROCO: Yes, thank you for the question. Some comments on that. In 2019, we refunded in order to reduce our exposure of 2020. So the other point that is important is that we have already proved that over the last 2 years that we were able to generate almost GBP 2 billion in terms of free cash flow after dividends and most of it had been used to pay down debt. So our debt and our bonds and bank maturities is adding up to GBP 4.3 billion now in 2020. We expect to some of the -- of that being paid down like we did in the previous 2 years with the free cash flow that we generate. And we have been active in terms of CP markets in euro and the U.S. dollar. And we have just renewed a new RCF, GBP 6 billion tranche, which is a liquidity backstop with a syndicate of 21 banks. They are very solid and diverse banks. There is no financial covenant around those. We are pretty sure that we can have access to them at any time. We -- there is no reason for us to do a preemptive movement at this point in time.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our last question comes from the line of Nico Von Stackelberg from Liberum.</p><p>NICO VON STACKELBERG: I have a follow-up. I hear some rumors that there might be EUTPD 3. Do you know what's in scope? Or have you had any conversations around EUTPD 3? Is there anything worth noting there in terms of closed systems? And I have one more question.</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes, there is -- there are always rumors. At the end of the day, facts matter more than rumors, and we don't see anything at this stage. There might be some adaptations in terms of regulations. I think that we've always said regulatory framework is extremely important. And if that regulatory framework makes sense for the consumer moving forward, then we will be interested in this. First, let's start with TPD that is going to happen soon. And we're well prepared for that, and we'll make sure that we take the benefit of that change in the regulation because we want to be a successful company, and we are a successful company.</p><p>NICO VON STACKELBERG: Okay. Great. And then I want to ask on menthol cigarettes, and I'm going to sort of use your question to understand what might happen in the U.S. if cigarettes -- if menthol cigarettes are banned at a federal level. Can you tell me about what you're doing currently in Europe on menthol ban here or from the learnings that you had from your Canadian experience? So what are you doing differently versus Canada over here in Europe? And does any of it really apply to the U.S.? Or is it just such a different market?</p><p>JACK MARIE HENRY DAVID BOWLES: Yes. Thank you very much. It's a very good question, and it's going to happen in a few months. So I understand the concern and the interest. Let me tell you, we are very well prepared for it. We know how to navigate these kind of changes of regulatory framework, and we know how to adapt our portfolio as we go along in order to make sure that we continue to grow value share and that we continue to grow market share. What's important to us is serving the consumers in the right way, having strong brands and continuing to deliver our business moving forward.</p><p>So I think it was the last question. So thank you very much. I know it has been a long day. It's an unusual format for this day. We've tried to make it as cleaner for you in terms of where do we want to be and how do we want to evolve the company. But let me recap a little bit.</p><p>First of all, we started the year very well. The second thing is we're a very resilient company in a very resilient industry. We have a very clear strategy in terms of growth moving forward. We even gave ourselves some ambition for 2030 because you need to have visibility and navigation. 50 million of noncombustible product consumers, carbon neutrality, and also, as Tadeu has demonstrated during his presentation, we want to deliver on the financial side of our business further and beyond growing share and growing value share. We are confident in high single figure EPS growth for 2020. We are building a better tomorrow, which is a company with purpose, a company with direction and a company that has delivered not only in 2019, but that will deliver in 2020 and will continue to do so. So we are extremely confident in our long-term growth opportunity for BAT moving forward. I think it is a very robust company that has very strong foundations and that will continue to deliver in the future.</p><p>Thank you very much for taking the time. And looking forward to see you soon.

And the markets enjoyed a bit of  a tipper (ph) as well, the S&amp;P and the Dow was up, the NASDAQ and the other  market was flat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Come along sir?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One, two, three, yes, there we are, that's how you close the market, that's  how you bring trading to a close on Friday, it's March the 16th.</p><p>As President Putin prepares for the polls, London's icy relationship with  Moscow has now gone into deep-freeze.</p><p>The E.U.'s list of hundreds of American products it would target if the  Trump tariff plan goes ahead.  We have the list and we will analyze the  contents.</p><p>A costly mistake, Snapchat's paying dearly for mocking the singer Rihanna.</p><p>I am Richard Quest, live in London where of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight, icy exchanges continue between Britain and Russia.   Vladimir Putin is now standing accused of ordering a killing on U.K.'s  soil, only days before he goes to the polls.  The accusation came from the  British Foreign Secretary, who says, \"It is overwhelmingly likely that Mr.  Putin approved the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy.\"  The  Kremlin calls those comments, \"Shocking and unpardonable,\" as it is  deciding how to retaliate.</p><p>Now at the same time, the British police say the death of a Russian  businessman in the U.K. capital, they are just saying it was murder.</p><p>Melissa Bell is covering that story from Salisbury, we'll talk about that  with Melissa, we will be with you in just a second.</p><p>Let's go to Fred Pleitgen who is in Moscow.  So, you know, the rhetoric is  ugly, we thought it couldn't get worse and it just.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  .has.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Yes.  I think you're absolutely right.  That's something that we  saw.  When that statement was first made by the Foreign Secretary, Boris  Johnson, where he said that he believed that it was overwhelmingly likely  that Vladimir Putin himself had ordered the hit on Sergei Skripal and Yulia  Skripal as well.</p><p>And you know, immediately after that was said we got in touch with the  Kremlin and they really they responded very, very quickly, Dmitry Peskov a  spokesman for Vladimir Putin, he came back and he sent us a message, I just  want to read a little bit of it, it's very short, but he says, \"We have  said on different levels on occasions that Russia has nothing to do with  this story, and here we come, any reference or mentioning of our president  is nothing else but shocking and unpardonable, diplomatic, misconduct,\" so  that's how the Russian see it.</p><p>As far as the Russian retaliation Richard, they say that they finalize what  they want to do in retaliation against the Brits but they have not exactly  said what that is yet Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Melissa, so we've got this extraordinary business of another  Russian dead in London, where the police say from compression of the neck,  attempted murder or -- well a murder in this case.  Is there a connection?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  There is.  No links say the  police. They repeated it once again in the statement that was issued in the  wake of that pathologist report that indicate that Nikolai Glushkov was  indeed murdered; there is no finger-pointing at the moment, there is no  blame being apportioned, this is very different to the case in Salisbury,  the Skripals where as you said Boris Johnson has firmly, squarely,  (INAUDIBLE) it's not just since the defeat of the Russians but of Vladimir  Putin himself.</p><p>And yet Richard, the timing of Nikolai Glushkov's death, the fact that he  was found Monday night, that is eight days after the Skripals were found  here in Salisbury slumped on a bench will raise questions, we're talking  about two Kremlin critics, with very different profiles, very different --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>Bear:  -- backgrounds who were attacked since one was found dead and the  other one remains in a critical but life-threatening condition, within  eight days of each other.</p><p>QUEST: Fred, help me understand, why would Vladimir Putin order the  assassination or the murder on a British Street in an English town of the - - of the spy.  I mean what's in it for Putin?</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well on the face of it, it doesn't seem to be anything in it for  Vladimir Putin and that certainly what the Russians are saying as well.   They're saying look, we have an election coming up here in Russia,  literally just two days away but it was two weeks away when the -- when the  poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter happened, they said there is  no reasons why the Russians would want any additional international  turmoil, with the international community, with the Brits, and with the  Americans as well so close to their election.</p><p>They also -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>[17:05:00] PLEITGEN:  -- say that quite frankly for them Sergei Skripal was  not of any sort of value, there was no reason for them to do this.</p><p>As far as Putin's popularity is concerned I mean it -- it's -- he's  certainly - it certainly hasn't impacted it negatively, he's certainly seen  as --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  -- someone who is very strong right now, this conflict shows him  as someone who is standing up to the West but I mean for him to allegedly  have ordered it because of that it really -- there really is nothing that  indicates that's actually the case.</p><p>Very interesting to see what the Brits actually have to underscore or any  evidence that they would have to make such a -- such a strong statement  like Boris Johnson actually made.</p><p>QUEST:  Friday night in Salisbury, I'm sure it will be a hotbed of activity  Melissa Bell.  In a sentence or two what's the mood there tonight?</p><p>BELL:  Well many questions here of course.  This is a city that is not used  to this sort of activity.  It certainly not used to be in the center this  sort of diplomatic storm and even now all of these areas that the Skripals  visited are cordoned off, we were confronted once again with --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>BELL:  -- police -- policemen wearing protective gear, collecting samples  again today.  This has become something the people have gotten use to over  the course of the last couple weeks in Salisbury.</p><p>They want answers.  How did the Skripals become poisoned? How were they  poisoned?  Where was it administered?  Why did this happen?  How could it  happen on British soil?  The people of Salisbury really want to get to the  bottom of that.</p><p>QUEST:  Melissa, Fred, thank you both.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Now Europe has started the process of retaliating against U.S.  tariffs even before they have been issued.  Europe has published a list,  it's 10 pages long, it is extremely detailed on products that could be hit.</p><p>And the E.U. is asking businesses that may be affected to provide comment.   Look it's rather dry when you see it like this so bring her in.  How about  this?</p><p>Now, you've got a much better idea of what we are talking about.  We've  shipped some of them in.  How about the bottle of Jack Daniels?  There are  about 16 different forms of rice, long grain, short grain, numerous orange  juices including those with added sugars, with added-this or with added- the-other and even the dreaded cigarettes; oh, and a pack of playing cards  because playing cards are also on the agenda into this.</p><p>So, what we have in this?  They're each now dealing their hand deciding who  is going to retaliate against what.  We couldn't fit some of these things  onto the desk, motorcycles, sailboats, and kitchen sinks for example.</p><p>Now the stakes could not be higher, in this particular game, the E.U. and  the U.S. trade around $1.3 trillion in goods and services, each --  everything from all of this to, well and maybe even how about a bit of a  paddle as well - thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me from Brussels, Jakob Hanke.  Jakob Hanke is the Reporter of  Politico, covering Trade.  I look at this very sizable list, basically they  have gone to the WTO list and they've just taken an entire range of U.S.  goods which could be there but Jakob how serious are the Europeans about  this?</p><p>JAKOB HANKE, TRADE REPORTER, POLITICO:  Right.  They've -- they've chosen  goods that are very known for being American goods and also goods that if  you target them, won't hit European producers because no big European  business need American whiskey or needs Harley-Davidsons to make its  machines.  Those -- they've chosen this rather smartly.  </p><p>They've also chosen products that will hit Republicans, in Republican  states.  How serious are they?  This is -- this is an escalation from the  E.U. side but the -- this was not the spin the E.U. was giving today.   There were saying we have to do this, just as a precaution.</p><p>It's definitely a --</p><p>QUEST:  But --</p><p>HANKE:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUEST:  -- but they are also having to go along with the U.S. story and the  U.S. game if you like by attempting to or applying for an exemption from  these sanctions.</p><p>So, they first of all got to -- I mean that's the first thing they've got  to decide, whether to apply for an exemption, under what terms, and whether  they will be granted it and there's only a week to go.</p><p>HANKE:  You're -- you're right Richard, they are trying to get an exemption  but this shows how little the trust is in the U.S.</p><p>I was speaking to a commission official today and he was saying, look even  if -- even if we get an exemption who is going to promise us that in a  month's time Trump is not going to get -- go back to his tariffs and hit us  after all so we need to be prepared this is why we've drafted this list.</p><p>And they've actually added more products.  It used to be EUR 2.8 billion,  no it's EUR 6.4, the total of products that the E.U. could hit back so  they're definitely warning Trump but I think there even more they're  warning Congress because they are hoping that Congress will put some  pressure on Trump to backtrack, this is the E.U.'s biggest tool (ph).</p><p>[17:10:00] QUEST:  Good to see you sir.  Thank you.</p><p>Jakob Hanke joining us here --</p><p>HANKE:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  --from Brussels tonight.  Thank you.</p><p>Now this whole tariff battle started over steel.  How you get from steel to  whiskey and orange juice, beggars belief.</p><p>But now Europe steelmakers are bracing for the tariffs to take a weak  effect one week from now.  The President says the measures were necessary  to counteract WTO rules which allow for unfair competition from markets  like the E.U. and China.</p><p>Axel Eggert joined me on the line, the Director General of the European  Steel Association and he basically said, the President's wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>AXEL EGGERT, DIRECTOR GENERAL, THE EUROPEAN STEEL ASSOCIATION, EUROFER:   The problem is not the WTO, the problem is that some countries are not  following the WTO and I would agree with the U.S. president that countries  such as China are not -- or not following the WTO rules but then we have to  strengthen the WTO and not undermine it.</p><p>The tariffs are undermining the WTO because not -- they are not according  to those rules, so my proposal would be that the U.S. is sitting together  with the European Union and working on further improving WTO rules which I  believe they are doing but in the meantime the U.S. tariffs attack E.U.  steel companies -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>EGGERT:  -- unfairly.  That's unfair trade and that's protectionism which  we do not want.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, so what do you want the European leaders, the community, the  commission, to do?  How strong do you want a retaliation to be?</p><p>EGGERT:  So first of all, of course we fully support the European  Commission, the European Union in deploying all the policy actions  possible, legitimately possible to counter the threat from U.S. Section  232.</p><p>Now there are several possibilities and of course rebalancing is one  option, it's a political option.  What the European Steel Industry in  particular needs now is safeguard measures because we expect deflection of  millions of tons of steel originally foreseen for the U.S. which will now  seek new markets and the European Union is the major open market in the  world.</p><p>So, logically those volumes would end up in our markets and destroy our  industry.  We really see ourselves back --</p><p>QUEST:  (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>EGGERT:  -- into a -- </p><p>QUEST:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>EGGERT:  -- crisis situation where we have been two years ago.</p><p>QUEST:  Right so do what President Trump has done, impose your own tariffs  on everybody else's steel.</p><p>Look, it may lead to a trade war but that's going to be the answer to the  Chinese or Indonesian or Indian steel that then gets dumped into the  European Union.</p><p>EGGERT:  I feel that is not the answer because if you're starting a trade  war now, we are risking according to studies with the U.S. tariffs, 20,000  steel worker's jobs in the European Union and 140,000 jobs in direct and  induced jobs in the European Union.</p><p>But also, in the U.S. according to studies, you are risking 150,000 jobs in  the steel-using sectors in the United States and that will not, let's say,  replay for or makeup the few jobs which could be added to today's U.S.  steel industry so we are all losing with the trade war.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you fear that a trade war is imminent?</p><p>EGGERT:  Yes.  We fear that a trade war may be the result but of course we  want to avoid any escalation so we still have some days' time until the  23rd of March when the U.S. tariffs will come into force and we appeal on  the U.S., and on the European Union to sit together.</p><p>And first of all, we need of course, exemption for the E.U. countries  because the E.U. is a close NATO partner, we are one of the most important  political and economic partners to the United States so there's absolutely  no reason to come with measures based on national security.</p><p>(END AUDIO)</p><p>QUEST:  Now just reading the list, a little bit detailed, extraordinarily,  sun beds, sun lamps, and similar, sun-tanning equipment and electric fence  energizers, just what you'd always wanted to have on a list of tariffs;  we're going to tariff your electric fence energizers.</p><p>(STUDIO BELL RINGING)</p><p>As we come up, it's Friday, so what's missing?</p><p>Well, a sacking at the White House, they're waiting for the revolving door  to turn once again </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>QUEST:  The door -- the revolving door at the White House is spinning  ominously, even as the White House says there are no immediate personnel  changes coming.</p><p>Now the administration is denying any rift between Mr. Trump and his  National Security Advisor, H. R. McMaster.  Speculation continues over his  long-term future in the administration and the White House insist it is  business as usual.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE:  The Chief of Staff  actually spoke to a number staff this morning reassuring them that there  were personnel changes -- no immediate personnel changes at this time and  that people shouldn't be concerned.  We should do exactly what we do every  day, that's come in to work and do the very best job that we can.</p><p>And that's exactly what we're doing, that's exactly what we are focused on  and many of us have relayed that to other staffers that weren't part of  that meeting and we're going to continue to focus on having record success  in the second year as we had in or first year and we fully expect to do  that and we expect that -- to do that as a staff and as a team.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  The tension, comes in part, from what has almost become a tradition  in this administration, losing a top official on a Friday, usually after  the markets close.</p><p>Now Mr. Trump got rid of a press secretary and a chief of staff on  consecutive Fridays, last July.  The same happened the next month with the  departure of his chief strategist and his deputy assistant, and his Health  secretary, also quit on a Friday night, in that case it was over a jet  scandal, flying on private jet.</p><p>Ryan Nobles is at the White House, what is it Ryan with Fridays?</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I don't know Richard.  I  know that we are all kind of like just waiting with nervous anticipation  for something to happen here today but I have to tell you that the White  House has made quite the effort to try and convince all of us here that  this isn't going to be one of those Fridays, that we shouldn't expect any  major staff changes.</p><p>Sarah Sanders, the Press Secretary, briefed earlier this afternoon and said  repeatedly, that there are no plans for anyone to lose their jobs or for  anyone to replace anyone today.  And we also know that Chief of Staff John  Kelly, specifically brought together staffers in the West Wing today to  tell them that nothing was imminent and at this point the President doesn't  have any plans to make any big moves.</p><p>But obviously the complicating factor to all of this Richard is that, while  there's no doubt that John Kelly and Sarah Saunders are close with Donald  Trump, the only person for sure who knows when the President is going to be  ready to make a staff move is the President himself and if he has --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NOBLES:  -- his phone at the ready and he decides he wants to makes a  staffing move, he could do that at any moment even tonight.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so it's going to be very difficult for -- oh, well not actually  anybody cares at the White House anymore but to do a -- to continue with a  straight face, having told everybody McMaster's is you know, rock-solid and  --</p><p>NOBLES:  Yes.</p><p>[17:20:00] QUEST:  -- there were no problems, even a weeks' time, he then - - he's then gone, what is it about McMaster?  This is one of the great  strategic thinkers, military thinkers in the U.S. Forces, what he's got  against him?</p><p>NOBLES:  Yes.  I mean it seems to be that there are just some certain  foreign policy issues and a style perhaps that General McMaster has that  doesn't necessarily seem to mesh with Donald Trump.</p><p>We know in particular that McMaster has long been a proponent of keeping  the Iran deal in place, this is something that Donald Trump just criticized  heavily during the campaign and has also suggested that --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NOBLES:  -- it may be time to tear the Iran deal up, that's just one  example.</p><p>We know that they also had different opinions as it comes to North Korea  but a lot of contrary, this comes down to personalities and there are  people that Donald Trump gets along with and people that he doesn't  necessarily get along with.</p><p>Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo are the two best examples of that, for some  reason Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump didn't get along --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NOBLES:  -- he's no longer the secretary of state. </p><p>He really likes Mike Pompeo and that's why he's going to take that job in  the very near future.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you Ryan.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.</p><p>NOBLES:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  It's Friday, just -- we've only got a few hours to go, Friday  would've passed without a firing.</p><p>Stephen Moore was an economic advisor to the Trump campaign, joins me now.   Wait, it's bizarre, come on Stephen, even with your friendship with the  President or having --</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Right.</p><p>QUEST:  -- worked for him and --</p><p>MOORE:  Right.</p><p>QUEST:  -- advised him, it's bizarre, his firings on a Friday.</p><p>MOORE:  Well you know, I guess -- and this is the President who it was --  two favorite words are, \"You're Fired,\" as we learned from his TV shows.</p><p>And you know, look, people say -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>MOORE:  -- there's a lot of chaos and crisis in the White House, I mean  this is the way he manages and you know, I work for him in business and so  I'm not that disturbed by it.</p><p>I'm -- as you know, Richard I'm very pleased by the fact that my buddy  Larry Kudlow is now going to be the head economist at the White House, he's  a superb economist, he was in your line of business by the way, he was a --  he had his own TV show for you know, 10 years, explaining finance and  economics.</p><p>And so, I think he's got a very good team in place right now.</p><p>QUEST:  OK so let's stick with economics.  I want to -- I want to go back  to what you and I were talking about earlier, along Quest --</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  -- Express because --</p><p>MOORE:  Right.</p><p>QUEST:  -- we were talking about Bear Stearns which of course collapsed 10  years ago today.  Now look, you were saying that the way around all of this  --</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  -- is to go back to sound lending, 10, you know, 10 --</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  -- percent, 20 percent deposits --</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  -- before you can buy a home.  Come on you've touched -- you've  lost touch with reality when you -- bearing in mind Stephen --</p><p>MOORE:  How so?  No that's --</p><p>QUEST:  -- the cost of an -- the cost of an apartment in New York or London  or Paris.</p><p>MOORE:  -- so let me -- let me take that up.</p><p>First of all, I did look at the data going back you know, in 2007 --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>MOORE:  -- '8, '9 and it is very true I mean it's -- it's just -- it's  clear as a bell that the low down-payment loans were the ones that were  foreclosed on.  It's very few loans with the down payment of 10 percent or  more were defaulted on and the reason for that is, people had skin in the  game.</p><p>Now think about this, if you --</p><p>QUEST:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  -- Richard, if you've got a let's say five percent down payment on  your house and let's say falls by 10 percent in value you don't have any  equity in the house, right?  In fact, your mortgages more expensive than  the home is worth and so people were walking away.</p><p>And -- what I'm saying is, I don't think we do any favor to people to  induce them to purchase a home that they can't afford and that's what  happened in 2007 and '8 and '9.</p><p>And then I want to make one other point because I was thinking about our  conversation earlier today, you asked me a tough question, you said, \"Are  we looking at 2007 and '8 again, another financial crisis,\" and I -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes.</p><p>MOORE:  -- was scratching my head and thinking about it.  And I'll -- I'll  tell you one thing that does worry me.</p><p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are back doing the 100 percent guarantees on  those three percent mortgages and that makes me nervous because those are - -</p><p>QUEST:  All right --</p><p>MOORE:  -- if you have a downturn in housing, people walk away.</p><p>QUEST:  -- but surely the bigger danger and I don't know how you'd solve  this, I don't have an answer but the bigger danger is the ability of Wall  Street, the city of London, or the financial industry to literally shoot  themselves in their foot, through greed, by coming up with the most complex  derivatives and instruments that requires a PhD to realize that it is not  going to blow you out the water.</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.  Look, that makes me uncomfortable too but as a point I made  to you earlier today is those derivatives -- not -- you know, a lot of  those weren't the instruments that caused the crisis, it really was what  was regarded as the safest investments and traditionally had been, which is  mortgages.</p><p>You know, Richard when you think about it, we had a big crash remembering  the stock market in 1999 and 2000 with -- remember the Dotcom bubble  bursting and of course we had it again in 2007 and '8 with the housing --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>MOORE:  -- bubble bursting, you just never know and I made this point you  before, we always -- when we regulate the financial markets we always put  out the last fire and we're not looking ahead at what's coming, where is  the overinvestment, where is the next bubble and if you know, that you'll - - you'll probably be a multimillionaire.</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>QUEST:  Look, if I knew that I would not be sitting here talking --</p><p>MOORE:  Exactly. And I wouldn't either.  Maybe you'd do it (ph)?</p><p>QUEST:  That's it.</p><p>Good to see you.  Thank you for today.  Good to have you, my pleasure -- </p><p>MOORE:  You too.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>QUEST:  -- as always.  And to you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, it's always nice on a Friday.  Never mind  (INAUDIBLE) Friday, it's nice on a Friday to be able to talk a little bit  more detail on these stories that we deal with every day.</p><p>As we continue, South Africa's ousted president Jacob Zuma has officially  now been hit with corruption charges.  We'll have more from Cape Town in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  @0:46</p><p>QUEST:  Well I'm Richard Quest.

Now we had links to  other Russians who have died under mysterious circumstances in Britain.</p><p>Russia is calling Friday's comments by the British Foreign Secretary,  \"Shocking, unpardonable, diplomatic misconduct.\"  Boris Johnson said, \"The  Russian president himself likely ordered the poisoning of a former Russian  spy in rural England.\"  Sergei Skripal and his daughter are in hospital and  remain in critical condition.</p><p>The White House continues to damp down speculation that more staff will  lose their jobs.  The Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says there is no  immediate personnel changes at this time, however sources tell CNN, the  National Security Advisor, H. R.

That's why I say that, if we had a  electricity, no more electricity at that time, he could be alive.  It pains  me, he could be alive.</p><p>SANTIAGO:  She blames Hurricane Maria for wiping out the island's power.   At least, a 120,000 customers still don't have power nearly six months  later.  The night her husband died, months after the storm, Mariam says  their generator run out of gas, living their home without power for the  machine her husband needed to breathe. </p><p>Natalio's(ph) grave is one of many this year, Cnn has identified at least  five deaths from 2018, identified by families, doctors or funeral homes as  related to Hurricane Maria.</p><p>Among them, Valio Salina Santiago(ph), his family tells us he died of a  heart attack in the parking lot of Monawo's(ph) Clinic, waiting for the  clinic to open.

It follows months after he  resigned as president.  Eleni Giokos is in Cape Town for us tonight.</p><p>These are historical allegations concerning arms deals back in the 1990s -- </p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN AFRICA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Was he in that (INAUDIBLE) then? </p><p>GIOKOS:  I mean, this is what is so fascinating about it.  We know that  Jacob Zuma has been protected during his presidency, you know, over the  last eight years or so. </p><p>And these original charges were dropped in 2009, Richard, just before he  became president.  Handing over the presidency for such a long time and  assigning the national prosecuting authority, coming in and saying, there's  enough evidence, there's enough of a case to prosecute Jacob Zuma.</p><p>Remember, this is a guy that we called the teflon president, surviving  numerous new corruption scandals swirling around him again for such a long  time.</p><p>And this isn't the only thing that he's going to face down the line.  You  know, an investigation into the so-called state capture and the capture of  Jacob Zuma is also currently underway, and it seems that this could be the  nail in the coffin for him, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, if convicted, one assumes, there will be a serious -- I mean,  honestly, it's a big hit.  There will be a serious time of imprisonment.</p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes, exactly, I mean, this is what everyone has been saying that,  you know, Jacob Zuma getting his day in court and getting his time in jail.   But we're also talking about a man that has been so good at delay tactics  and getting his defense team, you know, ready to fight as much as possible  and delaying as much as possible so that it just carries on for, you know,  two to -- </p><p>QUEST:  All right -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Three to four to five years.  But he's going to have money to do  that.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, now, let's look.  The reaction in South Africa to this, and  there was -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  And there was jubilation when he finally resigned and Cyril  Ramaphosa took over.  And -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  But you know, I guess is there an element of sharp fraudster that  is now going to be prosecuted, or will there be an ANC hardcore that says  no. </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes, I mean, look, the ANC also doesn't want to look weak.  And  it's stuck between a hard -- a rock and a hard place.  Because at the end  of the day, the ANC does have this black market against it because it  allows Jacob Zuma to get away with so much for such a long time. </p><p>At the other end, it's got to bring credibility back to the judiciary, and  that's going to be just as important.  With Jacob Zuma, has to pay for what  he did and a lot of money has been lost in the process, Richard.</p><p>I mean, just his defense, just defending Zuma within the presidency has  cost South Africa around $2 million, and many say it could be, you know,  just double that -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  So lots of positive reaction and people on the ground are hoping  to see the man behind bars.</p><p>QUEST:  Pravin Gordhan was on the program earlier in the week, and we were  talking -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  About a minister, and he was saying how difficult it's going to be  dealing with the state -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Capture.  But is there a feeling that even though Ramaphosa was the  number two, and Zuma, that -- this government is determined to clean up a  mess that maybe they -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Should have not let happen in the first place.  But at least,  they're getting on doing something about it -- </p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes, but you got a new different time, you've got Cyril Ramaphosa,  you know, speaking -- you know, talking this whole -- saying that he's  going to clean up, but it's something we've heard before. </p><p>[17:40:00] But remember, Richard, the people at the top within the  important ministerial positions of people we've known before, we've seen  them before.  We're hoping that this is going to be a new dawn like the  president says, a new ANC fighting corruption and it's got to be -- you  know, we've got to see the proof.</p><p>State capture, they've got to be results and consequences.  You know, you  spoke to Pravin Gordhan after -- you know, during that interview, I spoke  to him afterwards and he said, Eleni, it's going to be really tough because  we've got to get rid of people as well as finding where the money has gone  and bringing it back to the country.</p><p>So it's going to be a tough task, Richard, and everyone is watching, and  it's not going to be easy and it's not going to happen quickly.</p><p>QUEST:  Got it, Eleni, have a good weekend, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>GIOKOS:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  European markets, now take a look at the European markets with a  strange start to the day in Frankfurt.  Well, there were technical problems  and the trading was delayed. </p><p>The big mover of the day was next group, once known as ICAP, its shares  were up 30 percent after it got a takeover offer from CME Group.  Markets  have closed the week on something of a high.</p><p>Take a look and you'll see exactly how this market is closed.  Strong  impression, except that it don't quite show up until blip was right about  9:30 this morning.  But we won't waste no time too long enough.</p><p>Just look at that, it's a bit like the ounce, the way it did trade, now the  day still manages to put on 72 points.  It did go through 25,000 out once,  it was around 130 odd points, a third of a point, we'll take that.</p><p>Over the week as a whole, down 1.5 percent.  Caterpillar was one of the  biggest gainers, it's cutting 900 jobs in the United States and in Central  America.  Caterpillar was of course, also concerned there by the steel  tariffs coming into the United States.</p><p>The Nasdaq demand was sky high, and the first big tech IPO of the year.   It's a cyber security company, it's called the Zscaler, and it rose 106  percent on its market debut.</p><p>Now, I asked the company's chief executive, whether the enormous jump  basically when a share price rises that much, you misprice the stock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY CHAUDHRY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ZSCALER:  The thing with all that  wise and data we had, we made the call and I think it was a good call, and  I think the results really matter in the long run.</p><p>And I believe that if we keep on delivering value, keep on solving  (INAUDIBLE) problems, everything will work in the long run.  So it's a one  day focus, it's not really what you're looking at.            </p><p>QUEST:  All right, let's talk about the business you are in.  Everybody  agrees cyber security is the number one issue that really should be on the  minds of not just the CIO and the CTO, but also the CEO.  How -- </p><p>CHAUDHRY:  Yes -- </p><p>QUEST:  Woefully unprepared are we from major cyber attacks? </p><p>CHAUDHRY:  I think for you fairly unprepared, I knew you'll say that  because lots of these companies are getting hacked quite often.  And what  has happened is a cloud and mobility are driving business to move  applications to the cloud and use it as I work at home every day.</p><p>Because they're mobile, they're more productive, but security is stuck in  the data center, and the lots of security companies, but they all sell old  school technology that sits in the data center, trying to protect the data  center which is no longer the center of the universe.</p><p>That's why I started Zscaler to solve the security problem whereby security  must move the cloud, and it should be purpose built and that's what we did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, two executives, top executives of Nike  leave within 24 hours, and it's to do with improper conduct, but what has  gone on? We need to discover after the break. </p><p>[17:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Two Nike top executives left the company amid complaints about  inappropriate behavior.  And Vice President Jayme Martin was forced out on  Friday 24 hours after Nike's president left for the same reasons.</p><p>Ahiza Garcia joins me from New York.  I mean, one has to start with the  basics here.  What did they -- what did they do? What's the allegation  here?</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, SPORTS BUSINESS REPORTER, CNNMONEY:  It's very unclear at the  moment.  All Nike is saying is that there were work place issues and work  place conduct was not to the standard of Nike's code of conduct.</p><p>They have come out and denied that any allegations were brought against  Trevor Edwards.  For Jayme Martin, they're saying they cannot comment.  So  it's -- at this moment, it's very unclear.  But it does seem that Nike is  really trying to clean house on this.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, so, well, it sounds to me like one may have gone for  behavior and the other has gone for the way it was handled or something  like that.  I mean, which way -- you help me understand what's going on  there. </p><p>GARCIA:  Right, so Richard, so Trevor Edwards was the president, and -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>GARCIA:  And Jayme Martin worked below him.  So what -- that scenario that  you're laying out could make a lot of sense.  And if you look at the fact  that Trevor Edwards has not -- he immediately resigned from his position as  president of Nike brands. </p><p>But he's still staying on with the company until August, he will work under  -- as an adviser to Nike CEO Mark Parker.  So as we've seen with a lot of  these -- you know, these new cases within the Me Too Movement, when  allegations are brought, it seems to follow that the person -- the violator  whoever has -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>GARCIA:  Done this, who has committed this is immediately released.  And so  that kind of follows with what we're seeing with Jayme Edwards. </p><p>QUEST:  And where does it leave Nike in terms of succession or at least  upper management, direct to management, when you have the president who is  basically going in August.</p><p>GARCIA:  Right, and he was supposed to be -- he was kind of been groomed as  the new CEO or the next CEO after Parker.  Parker said in that same  announcement, where they said that Trevor Edwards was going to be stepping  down or stepping away.</p><p>And they said that Mark Parker will stay on through 2020.  So it seems to  me that as far as Nike is concerned, in terms of the succession of  management, they have a plan, right?</p><p>Mark Parker is just going to stay in place.  And it seems like they're just  going to clean house, and anyone below who, you know, wasn't kind of being  up to Nike's total conduct is going to be out.</p><p>QUEST:  How far has the sports world been hit by Me Too? In the sense, we  know what's happened in the media world, we know what's happened in the  entertainment world, and to a certain extent we've seen it within the  political world.</p><p>GARCIA:  Right, so the sports world has been a little more insulated, and I  hate to say that, but it just kind of is.  If you will look at some of the  bigger names that have had accusations, they haven't been recent. </p><p>So if you look at some of the -- you know, Steelers quarterback Ben  Roethlisberger thinks like players like him who had these allegations in  the past, and then seem to kind of right their wrongs, and it seems that  they've been insulated, right? </p><p>The Me Too Movement seems to be something that's like not hit the sports  world with the same retroactive punishment that it has the rest of the  political Hollywood -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>GARCIA:  Media world.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, have a good weekend, thank you very much.  Now -- </p><p>GARCIA:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  Some $800 million has been wiped from Snapchat's mark while get  capitalization.  And it's all because an offensive ad appeared on the  platform.  Now the ad was for an app for a game, would you rather, and it's  really simple. Would you rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown? </p><p>[17:50:00] It's distasteful even in its rawer sense, but want you to  remember that in 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to beating Rihanna, you start  it, you start to really understand how deeply grotesque this actually is.</p><p>Snap apologized and said it is investigating.  However, Rihanna is not  accepting that apology and saying, \"I'd love to call it ignorance, but I  know you ain't that dumb.  You spend money to animate something that would  intentionally bring shame to domestic violence victims and made a joke of  it.\"</p><p>Not the first celebrity to dent Snap's value.  Remember, Kylie Jenner says  does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore or was it just me? In this case,  the -- this is so sad.</p><p>It costs Snapchat $1.3 billion in market cap.  This one is about 800  million in it.  Joining me from San Francisco is Kurt Wagner; Recode's  senior editor for social media.</p><p>This is a fascinating one because you know, one question is, were  Snapchat's culpability is, bearing in mind, they are merely the  distribution channel if you like.  They didn't -- they didn't create the  ad, they're not the creators of the ad, but they're culpable because they  allowed it onto their site.</p><p>KURT WAGNER, SENIOR EDITOR FOR SOCIAL MEDIA, RECODE:  Yes, that's exactly  right, and Rihanna was a little bit confused in her statements, saying, you  -- you know, went out of your way to create this graphic. </p><p>Snap didn't create it, the advertiser did and they purchased ad space on  Snapchat and put that ad on there.  So there's little confusion around who  actually created the ad. </p><p>At the same time, a human moderator actually looked at this ad and said  this is OK to appear on Snapchat, Snap uses human beings to redo all of the  ads created because on the app -- except for a small group of advertisers  that they pre-approve.</p><p>So a human did say this was allowed, that's why Snap had to apologize, but  it wasn't Snap's ad, they just simply run the ad.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, the whole programmatic way in which apps do automatically  punch relevant apps to an algorithm of known interest from users.  Is it  possible, bearing in mind the size and scale that you can ever get -- the  sort of it here like -- just take a network like Cnn where it has -- or any  television network, you don't have that many commercials.</p><p>Therefore somebody can look at them and truly dissect them.  You can't do  that online within the greater numbers involved.</p><p>WAGNER:  Yes, and that's been an issue for both Facebook and YouTube most  recently, you know, it's called ad adjacency, right? If I'm a brand -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>WAGNER:  Where's my ad going to appear, so it's not just, is Facebook going  to run a crummy ad? But is Facebook going to run a good ad that runs next  to crummy content, right, with YouTube. </p><p>You know, someone's ad was appearing for example in front of before an ISIS  video, right? So if you're a marketer, the last thing you want is for your  ad to be last thing someone sees right before they see an ISIS recruiting  video.</p><p>So there's this issue right now when all of this automated, that it's  really hard to -- you know, monitor all the ad content and where it's going  to be in real time for everybody on the internet. </p><p>They can do it, you know, pretty well for some folks -- </p><p>QUEST:  All right, so -- </p><p>WAGNER:  But it's not everyone.</p><p>QUEST:  Let's be clear here.  The blame in this Rihanna story rests with  the creative who came up with it and who thought this was a good idea.  The  tangent(ph) if you like, tertiary blame goes to Snapchat only. </p><p>WAGNER:  I think that's right.  Whoever created the ad, obviously poor  choice, Snap gets a slap on the wrist because they should have known better  than to allow this to run on the platform.</p><p>But I think that you are -- I think that you said it clearly right there.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see sir, thank you, have a good weekend. </p><p>WAGNER:  Thank you, Richard, take care.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, now, you're all familiar with the bulldog that died because  it was put into the overhead compartment on the United Airlines flight from  Houston to New York. </p><p>And then there were the two dogs that got mixed up on United, one went to  Tokyo and the other went to Denver when they should have gone in the  opposite directions. </p><p>But now for the second time this week, a dog flying on the United Airlines  plane has been sent to the wrong destination.  OK, so the dog was meant to  fly from Newark to Akron, Ohio, and instead was put on a flight to Saint  Louis, Missouri instead.</p><p>The flight was diverted to Akron, all the passengers were offered  compensation and the dog made it home safely.  And it all follows an  instance where the Great Dane which was meant to go to Kansas City was  accidentally sent to Japan, and of course the bulldog that died.</p><p>[17:55:00] Continues to raise the question, does United Airlines have  systemic problems, not just with dogs, but obviously with certain -- with  passengers as well.  And one of the reasons why the Department of Transport  of the United States says it is now investigating what happened with the  various issues.</p><p>We'll have a profitable moment after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment.  The European Union's list of  potential items to be tariffed against United States is truly remarkable.   A digital flight data recorders, fully automatic household or laundry type  from clothing, washing machines. </p><p>And how about this one, electrical machines and apparatus, I think  individual functions.  And absolutely no idea what that means.  But I do  know what orange juice, Long Grain Rice, Tennessee Whiskey Jack Daniels  would mean.</p><p>We are just a week away from the tariffs from the United States coming into  effect.  And by publishing this list which is strategic in nature, but  somehow random in content -- well, we know that the European Union is  sending out a very sharp message. </p><p>The problem is whether anybody in Washington is listening.  Make no bones  about it, yes, we all still someway offer trade war, and there those people  that think it will never happen.</p><p>But we're not that far off, because all it will take is these tariffs to  come in without exemptions, untargeted, broad range and then bang, this  will come in. </p><p>And the president who doesn't like to be questioned will then go for the  next round and tit-for-tat becomes a full trade scale trade war.  Make no  bones about it, it still put up.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London,  I'm off in next week, whatever you're up to in the week ahead, I hope it's  profitable, I'll see you when I get back, have a good day. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

And the markets enjoyed a bit of a tipper (ph) as well, the S&amp;P and the Dow was up, the NASDAQ and the other market was flat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Come along sir?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One, two, three, yes, there we are, that's how you close the market, that's how you bring trading to a close on Friday, it's March the 16th.</p><p>As President Putin prepares for the polls, London's icy relationship with Moscow has now gone into deep-freeze.</p><p>The E.U.'s list of hundreds of American products it would target if the Trump tariff plan goes ahead. We have the list and we will analyze the contents.</p><p>A costly mistake, Snapchat's paying dearly for mocking the singer Rihanna.</p><p>I am Richard Quest, live in London where of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight, icy exchanges continue between Britain and Russia. Vladimir Putin is now standing accused of ordering a killing on U.K.'s soil, only days before he goes to the polls. The accusation came from the British Foreign Secretary, who says, \"It is overwhelmingly likely that Mr. Putin approved the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy.\" The Kremlin calls those comments, \"Shocking and unpardonable,\" as it is deciding how to retaliate.</p><p>Now at the same time, the British police say the death of a Russian businessman in the U.K. capital, they are just saying it was murder.</p><p>Melissa Bell is covering that story from Salisbury, we'll talk about that with Melissa, we will be with you in just a second.</p><p>Let's go to Fred Pleitgen who is in Moscow. So, you know, the rhetoric is ugly, we thought it couldn't get worse and it just.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: .has.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Yes. I think you're absolutely right. That's something that we saw. When that statement was first made by the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, where he said that he believed that it was overwhelmingly likely that Vladimir Putin himself had ordered the hit on Sergei Skripal and Yulia Skripal as well.</p><p>And you know, immediately after that was said we got in touch with the Kremlin and they really they responded very, very quickly, Dmitry Peskov a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, he came back and he sent us a message, I just want to read a little bit of it, it's very short, but he says, \"We have said on different levels on occasions that Russia has nothing to do with this story, and here we come, any reference or mentioning of our president is nothing else but shocking and unpardonable, diplomatic, misconduct,\" so that's how the Russian see it.</p><p>As far as the Russian retaliation Richard, they say that they finalize what they want to do in retaliation against the Brits but they have not exactly said what that is yet Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Melissa, so we've got this extraordinary business of another Russian dead in London, where the police say from compression of the neck, attempted murder or -- well a murder in this case. Is there a connection?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There is. No links say the police. They repeated it once again in the statement that was issued in the wake of that pathologist report that indicate that Nikolai Glushkov was indeed murdered; there is no finger-pointing at the moment, there is no blame being apportioned, this is very different to the case in Salisbury, the Skripals where as you said Boris Johnson has firmly, squarely, (INAUDIBLE) it's not just since the defeat of the Russians but of Vladimir Putin himself.</p><p>And yet Richard, the timing of Nikolai Glushkov's death, the fact that he was found Monday night, that is eight days after the Skripals were found here in Salisbury slumped on a bench will raise questions, we're talking about two Kremlin critics, with very different profiles, very different --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>Bear: -- backgrounds who were attacked since one was found dead and the other one remains in a critical but life-threatening condition, within eight days of each other.</p><p>QUEST: Fred, help me understand, why would Vladimir Putin order the assassination or the murder on a British Street in an English town of the - - of the spy. I mean what's in it for Putin?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well on the face of it, it doesn't seem to be anything in it for Vladimir Putin and that certainly what the Russians are saying as well. They're saying look, we have an election coming up here in Russia, literally just two days away but it was two weeks away when the -- when the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter happened, they said there is no reasons why the Russians would want any additional international turmoil, with the international community, with the Brits, and with the Americans as well so close to their election.</p><p>They also --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>[17:05:00] PLEITGEN: -- say that quite frankly for them Sergei Skripal was not of any sort of value, there was no reason for them to do this.</p><p>As far as Putin's popularity is concerned I mean it -- it's -- he's certainly - it certainly hasn't impacted it negatively, he's certainly seen as --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>PLEITGEN: -- someone who is very strong right now, this conflict shows him as someone who is standing up to the West but I mean for him to allegedly have ordered it because of that it really -- there really is nothing that indicates that's actually the case.</p><p>Very interesting to see what the Brits actually have to underscore or any evidence that they would have to make such a -- such a strong statement like Boris Johnson actually made.</p><p>QUEST: Friday night in Salisbury, I'm sure it will be a hotbed of activity Melissa Bell. In a sentence or two what's the mood there tonight?</p><p>BELL: Well many questions here of course. This is a city that is not used to this sort of activity. It certainly not used to be in the center this sort of diplomatic storm and even now all of these areas that the Skripals visited are cordoned off, we were confronted once again with --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>BELL: -- police -- policemen wearing protective gear, collecting samples again today. This has become something the people have gotten use to over the course of the last couple weeks in Salisbury.</p><p>They want answers. How did the Skripals become poisoned? How were they poisoned? Where was it administered? Why did this happen? How could it happen on British soil? The people of Salisbury really want to get to the bottom of that.</p><p>QUEST: Melissa, Fred, thank you both.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now Europe has started the process of retaliating against U.S. tariffs even before they have been issued. Europe has published a list, it's 10 pages long, it is extremely detailed on products that could be hit.</p><p>And the E.U. is asking businesses that may be affected to provide comment. Look it's rather dry when you see it like this so bring her in. How about this?</p><p>Now, you've got a much better idea of what we are talking about. We've shipped some of them in. How about the bottle of Jack Daniels? There are about 16 different forms of rice, long grain, short grain, numerous orange juices including those with added sugars, with added-this or with added- the-other and even the dreaded cigarettes; oh, and a pack of playing cards because playing cards are also on the agenda into this.</p><p>So, what we have in this? They're each now dealing their hand deciding who is going to retaliate against what. We couldn't fit some of these things onto the desk, motorcycles, sailboats, and kitchen sinks for example.</p><p>Now the stakes could not be higher, in this particular game, the E.U. and the U.S. trade around $1.3 trillion in goods and services, each -- everything from all of this to, well and maybe even how about a bit of a paddle as well - thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me from Brussels, Jakob Hanke. Jakob Hanke is the Reporter of Politico, covering Trade. I look at this very sizable list, basically they have gone to the WTO list and they've just taken an entire range of U.S. goods which could be there but Jakob how serious are the Europeans about this?</p><p>JAKOB HANKE, TRADE REPORTER, POLITICO: Right. They've -- they've chosen goods that are very known for being American goods and also goods that if you target them, won't hit European producers because no big European business need American whiskey or needs Harley-Davidsons to make its machines. Those -- they've chosen this rather smartly.</p><p>They've also chosen products that will hit Republicans, in Republican states. How serious are they? This is -- this is an escalation from the E.U. side but the -- this was not the spin the E.U. was giving today. There were saying we have to do this, just as a precaution.</p><p>It's definitely a --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>HANKE: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUEST: -- but they are also having to go along with the U.S. story and the U.S. game if you like by attempting to or applying for an exemption from these sanctions.</p><p>So, they first of all got to -- I mean that's the first thing they've got to decide, whether to apply for an exemption, under what terms, and whether they will be granted it and there's only a week to go.</p><p>HANKE: You're -- you're right Richard, they are trying to get an exemption but this shows how little the trust is in the U.S.</p><p>I was speaking to a commission official today and he was saying, look even if -- even if we get an exemption who is going to promise us that in a month's time Trump is not going to get -- go back to his tariffs and hit us after all so we need to be prepared this is why we've drafted this list.</p><p>And they've actually added more products. It used to be EUR 2.8 billion, no it's EUR 6.4, the total of products that the E.U. could hit back so they're definitely warning Trump but I think there even more they're warning Congress because they are hoping that Congress will put some pressure on Trump to backtrack, this is the E.U.'s biggest tool (ph).</p><p>[17:10:00] QUEST: Good to see you sir. Thank you.</p><p>Jakob Hanke joining us here --</p><p>HANKE: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: --from Brussels tonight. Thank you.</p><p>Now this whole tariff battle started over steel. How you get from steel to whiskey and orange juice, beggars belief.</p><p>But now Europe steelmakers are bracing for the tariffs to take a weak effect one week from now. The President says the measures were necessary to counteract WTO rules which allow for unfair competition from markets like the E.U. and China.</p><p>Axel Eggert joined me on the line, the Director General of the European Steel Association and he basically said, the President's wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>AXEL EGGERT, DIRECTOR GENERAL, THE EUROPEAN STEEL ASSOCIATION, EUROFER: The problem is not the WTO, the problem is that some countries are not following the WTO and I would agree with the U.S. president that countries such as China are not -- or not following the WTO rules but then we have to strengthen the WTO and not undermine it.</p><p>The tariffs are undermining the WTO because not -- they are not according to those rules, so my proposal would be that the U.S. is sitting together with the European Union and working on further improving WTO rules which I believe they are doing but in the meantime the U.S. tariffs attack E.U. steel companies --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>EGGERT: -- unfairly. That's unfair trade and that's protectionism which we do not want.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so what do you want the European leaders, the community, the commission, to do? How strong do you want a retaliation to be?</p><p>EGGERT: So first of all, of course we fully support the European Commission, the European Union in deploying all the policy actions possible, legitimately possible to counter the threat from U.S. Section 232.</p><p>Now there are several possibilities and of course rebalancing is one option, it's a political option. What the European Steel Industry in particular needs now is safeguard measures because we expect deflection of millions of tons of steel originally foreseen for the U.S. which will now seek new markets and the European Union is the major open market in the world.</p><p>So, logically those volumes would end up in our markets and destroy our industry. We really see ourselves back --</p><p>QUEST: (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>EGGERT: -- into a --</p><p>QUEST: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>EGGERT: -- crisis situation where we have been two years ago.</p><p>QUEST: Right so do what President Trump has done, impose your own tariffs on everybody else's steel.</p><p>Look, it may lead to a trade war but that's going to be the answer to the Chinese or Indonesian or Indian steel that then gets dumped into the European Union.</p><p>EGGERT: I feel that is not the answer because if you're starting a trade war now, we are risking according to studies with the U.S. tariffs, 20,000 steel worker's jobs in the European Union and 140,000 jobs in direct and induced jobs in the European Union.</p><p>But also, in the U.S. according to studies, you are risking 150,000 jobs in the steel-using sectors in the United States and that will not, let's say, replay for or makeup the few jobs which could be added to today's U.S. steel industry so we are all losing with the trade war.</p><p>QUEST: Do you fear that a trade war is imminent?</p><p>EGGERT: Yes. We fear that a trade war may be the result but of course we want to avoid any escalation so we still have some days' time until the 23rd of March when the U.S. tariffs will come into force and we appeal on the U.S., and on the European Union to sit together.</p><p>And first of all, we need of course, exemption for the E.U. countries because the E.U. is a close NATO partner, we are one of the most important political and economic partners to the United States so there's absolutely no reason to come with measures based on national security.</p><p>(END AUDIO)</p><p>QUEST: Now just reading the list, a little bit detailed, extraordinarily, sun beds, sun lamps, and similar, sun-tanning equipment and electric fence energizers, just what you'd always wanted to have on a list of tariffs; we're going to tariff your electric fence energizers.</p><p>(STUDIO BELL RINGING)</p><p>As we come up, it's Friday, so what's missing?</p><p>Well, a sacking at the White House, they're waiting for the revolving door to turn once again</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: The door -- the revolving door at the White House is spinning ominously, even as the White House says there are no immediate personnel changes coming.</p><p>Now the administration is denying any rift between Mr. Trump and his National Security Advisor, H. R. McMaster. Speculation continues over his long-term future in the administration and the White House insist it is business as usual.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE: The Chief of Staff actually spoke to a number staff this morning reassuring them that there were personnel changes -- no immediate personnel changes at this time and that people shouldn't be concerned. We should do exactly what we do every day, that's come in to work and do the very best job that we can.</p><p>And that's exactly what we're doing, that's exactly what we are focused on and many of us have relayed that to other staffers that weren't part of that meeting and we're going to continue to focus on having record success in the second year as we had in or first year and we fully expect to do that and we expect that -- to do that as a staff and as a team.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The tension, comes in part, from what has almost become a tradition in this administration, losing a top official on a Friday, usually after the markets close.</p><p>Now Mr. Trump got rid of a press secretary and a chief of staff on consecutive Fridays, last July. The same happened the next month with the departure of his chief strategist and his deputy assistant, and his Health secretary, also quit on a Friday night, in that case it was over a jet scandal, flying on private jet.</p><p>Ryan Nobles is at the White House, what is it Ryan with Fridays?</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I don't know Richard. I know that we are all kind of like just waiting with nervous anticipation for something to happen here today but I have to tell you that the White House has made quite the effort to try and convince all of us here that this isn't going to be one of those Fridays, that we shouldn't expect any major staff changes.</p><p>Sarah Sanders, the Press Secretary, briefed earlier this afternoon and said repeatedly, that there are no plans for anyone to lose their jobs or for anyone to replace anyone today. And we also know that Chief of Staff John Kelly, specifically brought together staffers in the West Wing today to tell them that nothing was imminent and at this point the President doesn't have any plans to make any big moves.</p><p>But obviously the complicating factor to all of this Richard is that, while there's no doubt that John Kelly and Sarah Saunders are close with Donald Trump, the only person for sure who knows when the President is going to be ready to make a staff move is the President himself and if he has --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NOBLES: -- his phone at the ready and he decides he wants to makes a staffing move, he could do that at any moment even tonight.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so it's going to be very difficult for -- oh, well not actually anybody cares at the White House anymore but to do a -- to continue with a straight face, having told everybody McMaster's is you know, rock-solid and --</p><p>NOBLES: Yes.</p><p>[17:20:00] QUEST: -- there were no problems, even a weeks' time, he then - - he's then gone, what is it about McMaster? This is one of the great strategic thinkers, military thinkers in the U.S. Forces, what he's got against him?</p><p>NOBLES: Yes. I mean it seems to be that there are just some certain foreign policy issues and a style perhaps that General McMaster has that doesn't necessarily seem to mesh with Donald Trump.</p><p>We know in particular that McMaster has long been a proponent of keeping the Iran deal in place, this is something that Donald Trump just criticized heavily during the campaign and has also suggested that --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NOBLES: -- it may be time to tear the Iran deal up, that's just one example.</p><p>We know that they also had different opinions as it comes to North Korea but a lot of contrary, this comes down to personalities and there are people that Donald Trump gets along with and people that he doesn't necessarily get along with.</p><p>Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo are the two best examples of that, for some reason Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump didn't get along --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NOBLES: -- he's no longer the secretary of state.</p><p>He really likes Mike Pompeo and that's why he's going to take that job in the very near future.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you Ryan. Thank you. Have a good weekend.</p><p>NOBLES: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: It's Friday, just -- we've only got a few hours to go, Friday would've passed without a firing.</p><p>Stephen Moore was an economic advisor to the Trump campaign, joins me now. Wait, it's bizarre, come on Stephen, even with your friendship with the President or having --</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST: Right.</p><p>QUEST: -- worked for him and --</p><p>MOORE: Right.</p><p>QUEST: -- advised him, it's bizarre, his firings on a Friday.</p><p>MOORE: Well you know, I guess -- and this is the President who it was -- two favorite words are, \"You're Fired,\" as we learned from his TV shows.</p><p>And you know, look, people say --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>MOORE: -- there's a lot of chaos and crisis in the White House, I mean this is the way he manages and you know, I work for him in business and so I'm not that disturbed by it.</p><p>I'm -- as you know, Richard I'm very pleased by the fact that my buddy Larry Kudlow is now going to be the head economist at the White House, he's a superb economist, he was in your line of business by the way, he was a -- he had his own TV show for you know, 10 years, explaining finance and economics.</p><p>And so, I think he's got a very good team in place right now.</p><p>QUEST: OK so let's stick with economics. I want to -- I want to go back to what you and I were talking about earlier, along Quest --</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- Express because --</p><p>MOORE: Right.</p><p>QUEST: -- we were talking about Bear Stearns which of course collapsed 10 years ago today. Now look, you were saying that the way around all of this --</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- is to go back to sound lending, 10, you know, 10 --</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- percent, 20 percent deposits --</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- before you can buy a home. Come on you've touched -- you've lost touch with reality when you -- bearing in mind Stephen --</p><p>MOORE: How so? No that's --</p><p>QUEST: -- the cost of an -- the cost of an apartment in New York or London or Paris.</p><p>MOORE: -- so let me -- let me take that up.</p><p>First of all, I did look at the data going back you know, in 2007 --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>MOORE: -- `8, `9 and it is very true I mean it's -- it's just -- it's clear as a bell that the low down-payment loans were the ones that were foreclosed on. It's very few loans with the down payment of 10 percent or more were defaulted on and the reason for that is, people had skin in the game.</p><p>Now think about this, if you --</p><p>QUEST: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: -- Richard, if you've got a let's say five percent down payment on your house and let's say falls by 10 percent in value you don't have any equity in the house, right? In fact, your mortgages more expensive than the home is worth and so people were walking away.</p><p>And -- what I'm saying is, I don't think we do any favor to people to induce them to purchase a home that they can't afford and that's what happened in 2007 and `8 and `9.</p><p>And then I want to make one other point because I was thinking about our conversation earlier today, you asked me a tough question, you said, \"Are we looking at 2007 and `8 again, another financial crisis,\" and I --</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>MOORE: -- was scratching my head and thinking about it. And I'll -- I'll tell you one thing that does worry me.</p><p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are back doing the 100 percent guarantees on those three percent mortgages and that makes me nervous because those are - -</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>MOORE: -- if you have a downturn in housing, people walk away.</p><p>QUEST: -- but surely the bigger danger and I don't know how you'd solve this, I don't have an answer but the bigger danger is the ability of Wall Street, the city of London, or the financial industry to literally shoot themselves in their foot, through greed, by coming up with the most complex derivatives and instruments that requires a PhD to realize that it is not going to blow you out the water.</p><p>MOORE: Yes. Look, that makes me uncomfortable too but as a point I made to you earlier today is those derivatives -- not -- you know, a lot of those weren't the instruments that caused the crisis, it really was what was regarded as the safest investments and traditionally had been, which is mortgages.</p><p>You know, Richard when you think about it, we had a big crash remembering the stock market in 1999 and 2000 with -- remember the Dotcom bubble bursting and of course we had it again in 2007 and `8 with the housing --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>MOORE: -- bubble bursting, you just never know and I made this point you before, we always -- when we regulate the financial markets we always put out the last fire and we're not looking ahead at what's coming, where is the overinvestment, where is the next bubble and if you know, that you'll - - you'll probably be a multimillionaire.</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>QUEST: Look, if I knew that I would not be sitting here talking --</p><p>MOORE: Exactly. And I wouldn't either. Maybe you'd do it (ph)?</p><p>QUEST: That's it.</p><p>Good to see you. Thank you for today. Good to have you, my pleasure --</p><p>MOORE: You too. Have a great weekend.</p><p>QUEST: -- as always. And to you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, it's always nice on a Friday.

It follows months after he resigned as president. Eleni Giokos is in Cape Town for us tonight.</p><p>These are historical allegations concerning arms deals back in the 1990s --</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Was he in that (INAUDIBLE) then?</p><p>GIOKOS: I mean, this is what is so fascinating about it. We know that Jacob Zuma has been protected during his presidency, you know, over the last eight years or so.</p><p>And these original charges were dropped in 2009, Richard, just before he became president. Handing over the presidency for such a long time and assigning the national prosecuting authority, coming in and saying, there's enough evidence, there's enough of a case to prosecute Jacob Zuma.</p><p>Remember, this is a guy that we called the teflon president, surviving numerous new corruption scandals swirling around him again for such a long time.</p><p>And this isn't the only thing that he's going to face down the line. You know, an investigation into the so-called state capture and the capture of Jacob Zuma is also currently underway, and it seems that this could be the nail in the coffin for him, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: OK, if convicted, one assumes, there will be a serious -- I mean, honestly, it's a big hit. There will be a serious time of imprisonment.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, exactly, I mean, this is what everyone has been saying that, you know, Jacob Zuma getting his day in court and getting his time in jail. But we're also talking about a man that has been so good at delay tactics and getting his defense team, you know, ready to fight as much as possible and delaying as much as possible so that it just carries on for, you know, two to --</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>GIOKOS: Three to four to five years. But he's going to have money to do that.</p><p>QUEST: OK, now, let's look. The reaction in South Africa to this, and there was --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And there was jubilation when he finally resigned and Cyril Ramaphosa took over. And --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: But you know, I guess is there an element of sharp fraudster that is now going to be prosecuted, or will there be an ANC hardcore that says no.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, I mean, look, the ANC also doesn't want to look weak. And it's stuck between a hard -- a rock and a hard place. Because at the end of the day, the ANC does have this black market against it because it allows Jacob Zuma to get away with so much for such a long time.</p><p>At the other end, it's got to bring credibility back to the judiciary, and that's going to be just as important. With Jacob Zuma, has to pay for what he did and a lot of money has been lost in the process, Richard.</p><p>I mean, just his defense, just defending Zuma within the presidency has cost South Africa around $2 million, and many say it could be, you know, just double that --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GIOKOS: So lots of positive reaction and people on the ground are hoping to see the man behind bars.</p><p>QUEST: Pravin Gordhan was on the program earlier in the week, and we were talking --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: About a minister, and he was saying how difficult it's going to be dealing with the state --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Capture. But is there a feeling that even though Ramaphosa was the number two, and Zuma, that -- this government is determined to clean up a mess that maybe they --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Should have not let happen in the first place. But at least, they're getting on doing something about it --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, but you got a new different time, you've got Cyril Ramaphosa, you know, speaking -- you know, talking this whole -- saying that he's going to clean up, but it's something we've heard before.</p><p>[17:40:00] But remember, Richard, the people at the top within the important ministerial positions of people we've known before, we've seen them before. We're hoping that this is going to be a new dawn like the president says, a new ANC fighting corruption and it's got to be -- you know, we've got to see the proof.</p><p>State capture, they've got to be results and consequences. You know, you spoke to Pravin Gordhan after -- you know, during that interview, I spoke to him afterwards and he said, Eleni, it's going to be really tough because we've got to get rid of people as well as finding where the money has gone and bringing it back to the country.</p><p>So it's going to be a tough task, Richard, and everyone is watching, and it's not going to be easy and it's not going to happen quickly.</p><p>QUEST: Got it, Eleni, have a good weekend, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: European markets, now take a look at the European markets with a strange start to the day in Frankfurt. Well, there were technical problems and the trading was delayed.</p><p>The big mover of the day was next group, once known as ICAP, its shares were up 30 percent after it got a takeover offer from CME Group. Markets have closed the week on something of a high.</p><p>Take a look and you'll see exactly how this market is closed. Strong impression, except that it don't quite show up until blip was right about 9:30 this morning. But we won't waste no time too long enough.</p><p>Just look at that, it's a bit like the ounce, the way it did trade, now the day still manages to put on 72 points. It did go through 25,000 out once, it was around 130 odd points, a third of a point, we'll take that.</p><p>Over the week as a whole, down 1.5 percent. Caterpillar was one of the biggest gainers, it's cutting 900 jobs in the United States and in Central America. Caterpillar was of course, also concerned there by the steel tariffs coming into the United States.</p><p>The Nasdaq demand was sky high, and the first big tech IPO of the year. It's a cyber security company, it's called the Zscaler, and it rose 106 percent on its market debut.</p><p>Now, I asked the company's chief executive, whether the enormous jump basically when a share price rises that much, you misprice the stock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY CHAUDHRY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ZSCALER: The thing with all that wise and data we had, we made the call and I think it was a good call, and I think the results really matter in the long run.</p><p>And I believe that if we keep on delivering value, keep on solving (INAUDIBLE) problems, everything will work in the long run. So it's a one day focus, it's not really what you're looking at.</p><p>QUEST: All right, let's talk about the business you are in. Everybody agrees cyber security is the number one issue that really should be on the minds of not just the CIO and the CTO, but also the CEO. How --</p><p>CHAUDHRY: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Woefully unprepared are we from major cyber attacks?</p><p>CHAUDHRY: I think for you fairly unprepared, I knew you'll say that because lots of these companies are getting hacked quite often. And what has happened is a cloud and mobility are driving business to move applications to the cloud and use it as I work at home every day.</p><p>Because they're mobile, they're more productive, but security is stuck in the data center, and the lots of security companies, but they all sell old school technology that sits in the data center, trying to protect the data center which is no longer the center of the universe.</p><p>That's why I started Zscaler to solve the security problem whereby security must move the cloud, and it should be purpose built and that's what we did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, two executives, top executives of Nike leave within 24 hours, and it's to do with improper conduct, but what has gone on? We need to discover after the break.</p><p>[17:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Two Nike top executives left the company amid complaints about inappropriate behavior. And Vice President Jayme Martin was forced out on Friday 24 hours after Nike's president left for the same reasons.</p><p>Ahiza Garcia joins me from New York. I mean, one has to start with the basics here. What did they -- what did they do? What's the allegation here?</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, SPORTS BUSINESS REPORTER, CNNMONEY: It's very unclear at the moment. All Nike is saying is that there were work place issues and work place conduct was not to the standard of Nike's code of conduct.</p><p>They have come out and denied that any allegations were brought against Trevor Edwards. For Jayme Martin, they're saying they cannot comment. So it's -- at this moment, it's very unclear. But it does seem that Nike is really trying to clean house on this.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so, well, it sounds to me like one may have gone for behavior and the other has gone for the way it was handled or something like that. I mean, which way -- you help me understand what's going on there.</p><p>GARCIA: Right, so Richard, so Trevor Edwards was the president, and --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GARCIA: And Jayme Martin worked below him. So what -- that scenario that you're laying out could make a lot of sense. And if you look at the fact that Trevor Edwards has not -- he immediately resigned from his position as president of Nike brands.</p><p>But he's still staying on with the company until August, he will work under -- as an adviser to Nike CEO Mark Parker. So as we've seen with a lot of these -- you know, these new cases within the Me Too Movement, when allegations are brought, it seems to follow that the person -- the violator whoever has --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>GARCIA: Done this, who has committed this is immediately released. And so that kind of follows with what we're seeing with Jayme Edwards.</p><p>QUEST: And where does it leave Nike in terms of succession or at least upper management, direct to management, when you have the president who is basically going in August.</p><p>GARCIA: Right, and he was supposed to be -- he was kind of been groomed as the new CEO or the next CEO after Parker. Parker said in that same announcement, where they said that Trevor Edwards was going to be stepping down or stepping away.</p><p>And they said that Mark Parker will stay on through 2020. So it seems to me that as far as Nike is concerned, in terms of the succession of management, they have a plan, right?</p><p>Mark Parker is just going to stay in place. And it seems like they're just going to clean house, and anyone below who, you know, wasn't kind of being up to Nike's total conduct is going to be out.</p><p>QUEST: How far has the sports world been hit by Me Too? In the sense, we know what's happened in the media world, we know what's happened in the entertainment world, and to a certain extent we've seen it within the political world.</p><p>GARCIA: Right, so the sports world has been a little more insulated, and I hate to say that, but it just kind of is. If you will look at some of the bigger names that have had accusations, they haven't been recent.</p><p>So if you look at some of the -- you know, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger thinks like players like him who had these allegations in the past, and then seem to kind of right their wrongs, and it seems that they've been insulated, right?</p><p>The Me Too Movement seems to be something that's like not hit the sports world with the same retroactive punishment that it has the rest of the political Hollywood --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>GARCIA: Media world.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, have a good weekend, thank you very much. Now --</p><p>GARCIA: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: Some $800 million has been wiped from Snapchat's mark while get capitalization. And it's all because an offensive ad appeared on the platform. Now the ad was for an app for a game, would you rather, and it's really simple. Would you rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown?</p><p>[17:50:00] It's distasteful even in its rawer sense, but want you to remember that in 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to beating Rihanna, you start it, you start to really understand how deeply grotesque this actually is.</p><p>Snap apologized and said it is investigating. However, Rihanna is not accepting that apology and saying, \"I'd love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain't that dumb. You spend money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to domestic violence victims and made a joke of it.\"</p><p>Not the first celebrity to dent Snap's value. Remember, Kylie Jenner says does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore or was it just me? In this case, the -- this is so sad.</p><p>It costs Snapchat $1.3 billion in market cap. This one is about 800 million in it. Joining me from San Francisco is Kurt Wagner; Recode's senior editor for social media.</p><p>This is a fascinating one because you know, one question is, were Snapchat's culpability is, bearing in mind, they are merely the distribution channel if you like. They didn't -- they didn't create the ad, they're not the creators of the ad, but they're culpable because they allowed it onto their site.</p><p>KURT WAGNER, SENIOR EDITOR FOR SOCIAL MEDIA, RECODE: Yes, that's exactly right, and Rihanna was a little bit confused in her statements, saying, you -- you know, went out of your way to create this graphic.</p><p>Snap didn't create it, the advertiser did and they purchased ad space on Snapchat and put that ad on there. So there's little confusion around who actually created the ad.</p><p>At the same time, a human moderator actually looked at this ad and said this is OK to appear on Snapchat, Snap uses human beings to redo all of the ads created because on the app -- except for a small group of advertisers that they pre-approve.</p><p>So a human did say this was allowed, that's why Snap had to apologize, but it wasn't Snap's ad, they just simply run the ad.</p><p>QUEST: Now, the whole programmatic way in which apps do automatically punch relevant apps to an algorithm of known interest from users. Is it possible, bearing in mind the size and scale that you can ever get -- the sort of it here like -- just take a network like Cnn where it has -- or any television network, you don't have that many commercials.</p><p>Therefore somebody can look at them and truly dissect them. You can't do that online within the greater numbers involved.</p><p>WAGNER: Yes, and that's been an issue for both Facebook and YouTube most recently, you know, it's called ad adjacency, right? If I'm a brand --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>WAGNER: Where's my ad going to appear, so it's not just, is Facebook going to run a crummy ad? But is Facebook going to run a good ad that runs next to crummy content, right, with YouTube.</p><p>You know, someone's ad was appearing for example in front of before an ISIS video, right? So if you're a marketer, the last thing you want is for your ad to be last thing someone sees right before they see an ISIS recruiting video.</p><p>So there's this issue right now when all of this automated, that it's really hard to -- you know, monitor all the ad content and where it's going to be in real time for everybody on the internet.</p><p>They can do it, you know, pretty well for some folks --</p><p>QUEST: All right, so --</p><p>WAGNER: But it's not everyone.</p><p>QUEST: Let's be clear here. The blame in this Rihanna story rests with the creative who came up with it and who thought this was a good idea. The tangent(ph) if you like, tertiary blame goes to Snapchat only.</p><p>WAGNER: I think that's right. Whoever created the ad, obviously poor choice, Snap gets a slap on the wrist because they should have known better than to allow this to run on the platform.</p><p>But I think that you are -- I think that you said it clearly right there.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see sir, thank you, have a good weekend.</p><p>WAGNER: Thank you, Richard, take care.</p><p>QUEST: Right, now, you're all familiar with the bulldog that died because it was put into the overhead compartment on the United Airlines flight from Houston to New York.</p><p>And then there were the two dogs that got mixed up on United, one went to Tokyo and the other went to Denver when they should have gone in the opposite directions.</p><p>But now for the second time this week, a dog flying on the United Airlines plane has been sent to the wrong destination. OK, so the dog was meant to fly from Newark to Akron, Ohio, and instead was put on a flight to Saint Louis, Missouri instead.</p><p>The flight was diverted to Akron, all the passengers were offered compensation and the dog made it home safely. And it all follows an instance where the Great Dane which was meant to go to Kansas City was accidentally sent to Japan, and of course the bulldog that died.</p><p>[17:55:00] Continues to raise the question, does United Airlines have systemic problems, not just with dogs, but obviously with certain -- with passengers as well. And one of the reasons why the Department of Transport of the United States says it is now investigating what happened with the various issues.</p><p>We'll have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. The European Union's list of potential items to be tariffed against United States is truly remarkable. A digital flight data recorders, fully automatic household or laundry type from clothing, washing machines.</p><p>And how about this one, electrical machines and apparatus, I think individual functions. And absolutely no idea what that means. But I do know what orange juice, Long Grain Rice, Tennessee Whiskey Jack Daniels would mean.</p><p>We are just a week away from the tariffs from the United States coming into effect. And by publishing this list which is strategic in nature, but somehow random in content -- well, we know that the European Union is sending out a very sharp message.</p><p>The problem is whether anybody in Washington is listening. Make no bones about it, yes, we all still someway offer trade war, and there those people that think it will never happen.</p><p>But we're not that far off, because all it will take is these tariffs to come in without exemptions, untargeted, broad range and then bang, this will come in.</p><p>And the president who doesn't like to be questioned will then go for the next round and tit-for-tat becomes a full trade scale trade war. Make no bones about it, it still put up.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London, I'm off in next week, whatever you're up to in the week ahead, I hope it's profitable, I'll see you when I get back, have a good day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p>The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and App Store. </p><p>The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p>\"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. </p><p>Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p>EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into complaints of unfair practices against Amazon.</p><p>British Financial Secretary Philip Hammond said the recommendations must be approved by Parliament to take effect.</p><p>Recommendations include setting up a digital markets unit that would give people more control over their data, letting them move or share personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p>The report's authors said \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p>The report also recommends getting big companies to share key data with startups, while safeguarding personal information, to help foster innovation and new business ideas; drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behavior for tech companies in their relationships with users; and rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers that could \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\" </p><p>Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to authorize a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B61999602Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMT-S5R1-DYRG-W131-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Other options would lead to delay, to uncertainty and risk never delivering Brexit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p>CORBYN: Mr. Speaker, the only problem with the Prime Minister's answer is that her deal has been twice defeated in this House by in one case the largest the -- in one case, Mr. Speaker, the largest ever majority by which a government has lost a vote in our recorded parliamentary history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And that is about the only certainty. And this week, Parliament seize control of the agenda from the prime minister. It's a very rare step. But then, they failed to agree on any alternative Brexit plan.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a better person to help us understand all this than the Conservative M.P., Kenneth Clarke. He's known as the Father of the House, a title given to the M.P. with the longest record of continuous service. He has held many top government positions, including Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he's a passionate Remainer. He joins me now from a studio near Parliament</p><p>Kenneth Clarke, welcome to the program.</p><p>KENNETH CLARKE, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE M.P.: I'm delighted to be here.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you're over there are not over here partly because you're still, you know, watching and waiting and seeing and haggling and negotiating and seeing if we can get to any clarity.</p><p>So, you know, tomorrow --</p><p>CLARKE: That about sums up my day.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. Your day today and every day. So, you know, for all we knew, for months now, tomorrow was meant to be Brexit day and that can has been kicked down the road. What do you think is likely to happen, given this unbelievable face that not a single alternative that the Parliament, you know, wanted to see if it could find a majority, not a single one did?</p><p>CLARKE: Well, firstly, the government has decided that tomorrow is Brexit day again and they are going to try have a third attempt to get the prime minister's withdrawal agreement through, which I have she does it happens. I'm a ferocious pro-European, but I voted for the withdrawal agreement, which I think is quite harmless.</p><p>So far as a Parliament's attempt to take over and if she fails again, we knew, we were canvassing every possible option, we knew probably there'd be not a majority of any single one because people plug their favorite. We come back on Monday if the prime minister fails to make progress. On Monday, then we'll concentrate on fewer options in the moment (ph). I mean, I can't guess what's going to happen here at the moment. I'm reasonably confident that mine, at least, will get a majority.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And yours is one that was -- you know, got amongst the most votes and it's the one that talks about a customs union. Is that correct?</p><p>CLARKE: That is correct. I got the nearest to getting majority. I was only defeated by right votes, as it was the nearest to success. Some people abstained on it who really shouldn't have abstained on it but they were hoping that other things they preferred would do better. I think on Monday people will see this is the strongest way of coalescing around one option.</p><p>I'm not advocating new because you -- have most you haven't got a vote on it. But it's my genuine belief and I chose this amendment because it is the simplest, it's the lowest common denominator. I would like to see much more with the Customs Union. I'd like to stay in the European Union and I'd like to be in the single market in the Customs Union.</p><p>I deliberately pitched this basic one principle, least we mandate the government to be the Customs Union, (INAUDIBLE) a lot of other things, that would encourage the House to enable it all to move forward. And that should succeed on Monday if the government fails tomorrow, which they might. I mean, Theresa's falling on her sword and she still can't guarantee getting the right-wing of the party all to vote for her.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I mean, that's what I was going to ask you next, the fact that she has fallen on her sword, the prime minister, offering to resign early if they would only just pass deal. And even that, as you correctly say, did not get people to do that, and there's still people on the fence.</p><p>What do you think about the ethics of that? I mean, it sounds a little sort of like, I don't know, like she's being extorted to an extent. I mean, what do you think of demanding and then not stepping out with a vote that a prime minister leave?</p><p>CLARKE: (INAUDIBLE) dreadful. I mean, I have (INAUDIBLE) with Theresa May. I supported her withdrawal agreement but I think she's made many tactical errors. But the right-wing of my party, the nationalist right- wing, have formed a little party within a party which is they hope will take over the whole party. And they've been trying to get rid of Theresa for some time now. They launched an incompetent coup against her earlier year, which she survived.</p><p>And it's actually extraordinary, she pays far too much attention to them.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>CLARKE: They all (INAUDIBLE) out in their sports cars and their limos. To see her country, prime minister retreats on Sunday and obviously, all gave her an ultimatum and it is sad that she's given into it. I mean, I wouldn't have done that. But she has and it will be really -- I mean, I would find it, you know, really a dreadful outcome if she still fails to get them to deliver tomorrow. I would never have trusted them myself.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, can I just ask you then, what would you have done? Because many have made that point, those who've got the sort of nobody in the House has got the longevity that you have, nearly 50 years as an M.P.</p><p>CLARKE: True.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But people have said, \"Hang on. Her opposition played their card and they lost and they're still holding her hostage.\" I mean, is there really any way out of this now? What would you have done differently?</p><p>CLARKE: Well, the way out is to appeal to the Labour Party. Theresa's mistake has been made, firstly, to start the whole process before she did any clear idea of what she wanted. I mean, then to put down red lines, which are completely undeliverable contradict to each other. And then to get to this one simple solution and stick to it and keep trying to unite her own party.</p><p>Now, the other side of the House of Commons, the Labour Party, large numbers of members of the Labour Party are more pro-European than their leadership, don't want a disastrous no-deal departure. There are political enemies. Within the national interest, she should have reached across to them.</p><p>The reason -- if my amendment wins tomorrow, well, let's just confine ourselves to the fact that my amendment nearly got a majority yesterday, you know, closer than the prime minister ever has. I had most of the Labour Party voting with me. I had various straight people from other parties.</p><p>Next Monday, I would tell you, I'm (INAUDIBLE), I'm trying to negotiate get them to join. The reason I think I have a majority people and I have people from every party in the House will join us in voting -- some of them, in voting for it because Europe breaks up our party system.</p><p>Now, she -- Theresa should early on have spent 12 months ago, probably, started reaching across to the Labour Party and reaching an understanding with them because, you know, you can be enemies on the bigger issues, we certainly are with the left-wing leadership of the Labour Party, but the national interest and the stability of our future relationships with our biggest economic and political partners.</p><p>I mean, it was a cross party consensus (INAUDIBLE). But as she's a traditional alternative (ph) leader, keeping the party united and winning with party votes is what she constantly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. And it does seem many people have accused members of many, many parties, but most especially the prime minister and the hardliners, of putting their own political interests ahead of the national interest.</p><p>But I just want to ask you, just to listen to this little clip we're going to play. It's frankly from an American late-night comedy show, but it is designed to try to explain to our American viewers and to people who are really, really watching this process what's going on. So, this isn't a little tweak at the prime minister over her handling of it. Just listen for a second.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMANTHA BEE: This is the woman who knows the meaning of Brexit.</p><p>MAY: Brexit means Brexit. And we're going to make a success of it.</p><p>BEE: And no one knows what that means either or even how to say it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will make breakfast -- Brexit.</p><p>BEE: That (INAUDIBLE). She's busy having the time of her life, for missing Brexit will be easy even though she has no idea how to fix all this stuff. And rather than figure it out first, she decides to pass the law that triggers that Brexit countdown clock, which means May has to figure everything out by March 2019.</p><p>And if she doesn't, will crash out of the E.U. with no deal at all, which is very bad. So, the E.U. stops (INAUDIBLE) and says, \"Maybe let's start figuring out what the hell you just did?\" But May is like, \"Not now. Thanks, love.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, you know, it's funny if it wasn't so serious. This was from Samantha Bee, \"Full Frontal,\" in the United States. It is --</p><p>CLARKE: Well, what's happening here, it would be entertaining if it wasn't a very, very serious. For political addict like me, the machinations going on in the House of governments are absolutely fascinating, political game, which obviously is not just a game.</p><p>I mean, the future, prosperity of the next generation or two and Britain's status in the world is all going to be determined by the eventual outcome of this.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I just want to ask because you gave a very, very impassioned speech in the House regarding that particular issue, and that was the idea of her calling Article 50 and triggering Article 50 before that there was any -- you know, any idea of a road map.</p><p>You were very, very upset and you said things like this House has gone mad, Brexit will be a historic disaster. And you even said that, you know, \"Perhaps we should all just stay -- you know, ignore the referendum and just stay in the E.U.\" What do you think seriously about that today? Do you think enough demographics have changed, enough public opinion has changed? Because another of the big votes the did come second to yours was --</p><p>CLARKE: Yes. They're trying to get people's vote.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- a second referendum. Yes.</p><p>CLARKE: Well, firstly, you've chosen some of the flowery phrases I've used. I mean, I've tried to use throughout, try to be, you know, a bit statesman like and argue common sense and practicality. But I -- as you say, I've got out of the corner (ph) sometimes because I -- it's undeniable that the system is dysfunctional the moment and the public here are very, very annoyed about it and holding their politicians in near contempt.</p><p>So, what -- with -- I mean, (INAUDIBLE), I was always against having a referendum in the first place, as in Cameron's cabinet, but he went off and announced it without even telling me. I read it in the newspapers. Now, it did turn out to be a disaster.</p><p>So, I'm not in favor of a second referendum, a simple yes, no answers to hugely complex sometimes specialist questions that all depend on the answer, I mean, is no way of running anything. There we are. And I know that some people who do except referendums, the pro-European, are now passionately demanding a second one. There's a lot of support for that in the House because they're all trying to get off the hook.</p><p>I'm one of the few M.P.'s who did not promise to be bound by the result of the referendum. The others want to get off by having another referendum and her winning it. Meanwhile, the Brexiteers, you know, the only democratic referendum is the one they want. Any subsequent referendum is undemocratic. They've got all their prize and they get very, very angry at the idea that people might be asked if they change their minds, although M.P.'s. change their minds all the time.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, to that point, let me just put a few (INAUDIBLE). Our reporters have been talking to some people in various parts of the country about the current state of affairs, and this is in the wake of, you know, 6 million people signing a petition about revoking Article 50 over the weekend, there was a massive march of people talking about, you know, let's try and do something different. But this is what people are saying on the streets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, we're in such a mess. And whether she's put us there or whether the situation has put us there, I don't know. I think hindsight, we'll be a wonderful thing when it happens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we need to get out and that's it really. To put a no-deal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm quite sad about it all. And I think at the moment, it's a bit of a mess.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just kind of comes across as a bit pointless (INAUDIBLE) to be honest, because it doesn't seem like the vote was taken seriously.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think a lot of people (INAUDIBLE) would vote differently, I really do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, I mean, that you see a mixed opinion. But I mean, on both sides like overwhelming majorities feel that it's being handled by the government and prime minister extremely badly.</p><p>You mentioned that you were in David Cameron's cabinet. You know, he's told us and he's told others that he doesn't regret calling the referendum. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>CLARKE: I think it was the worst decision David made. I think it was reckless, it was irresponsible. I was very angry when I read about it. I (INAUDIBLE) but I still stayed in his cabinet because -- I would never resign. I didn't vote for it as a (ph) government, but they didn't bother about that despite the fact I was Lord Chancellor and I was Justice Secretary in the government.</p><p>I was furious that he called it. I'm afraid I (INAUDIBLE) go very well with David. But with hindsight, I think it's a number for a guy he's asked to go very well with David. But with hindsight, I think one can claim he set off a chain of events, which has been disastrous for the working of our democracy in this country.</p><p>You're vox pop just showed how the public obviously are not engaged with the complex detail, which is frustrating the House of Commons. The trouble with referendums is, in the real world, somebody has got to actually deal with complex specialized issues, trade negotiations, arrangements for regulations, how do you keep the Irish border open. I dare you can devise an opinion poll question with a yes, no answer. That means the public decide the whole blocks of those things one way or the other is nonsense.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>CLARKE: They're all angry about the mess, which they quite rightly say it's in, and people to say, \"Oh, let's leave with no-deal. Let's get it all over with. God, I'd like read about something else,\" all this sort of thing. Ad so we've got ourselves again in a mess because the public having had a referendum can't understand why the politicians haven't simply delivered it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And if I might, it's a mess of historic proportions but with historic potential ramifications. I guess I just want to ask you because everybody is trying to figure out leadership. You know, there's this crisis of leadership all over the world now and I wonder whether you think your party will survive, whether the Labour Party, which is equally riven over different issues, the anti-Semitism and other such things, will the traditional parties survive the next cycle, if you like, or two? And do you ever think, \"Hold on a second. Maybe I should have resigned and joined the independent movement.\" Why do you stay in the party given, you know, your sensible centrism?</p><p>CLARKE: Well, you wrapped a lot up there. Firstly, both parties are at risk of not surviving, which is true or was said to being transformed, they're both polarizing. I mean, what I would say is it happened in every Western democracy. I mean, we haven't time to go into it unless you are going to have me on for a very long time.</p><p>But the Trump, Brexit, Yellow Jackets in France, kind of anarchist government in Italy, I could go on with other groups, they're all the same thing, the traditional political parties of center left, center right, vanished in France, polarizing and breaking up in Britain.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>CLARKE: Changed in American, as you would know certainly much better than me but not the old Republican and Democrat parties that I knew. And behind that is an angry public that finds the pace of change, the complexity of bottom life very difficult.</p><p>One answer I would say to any other countries, don't try and have a simple broad brush --</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>CLARKE: -- by holding a referendum.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I'm afraid on that note, we have to end. And I don't know whether you're going to one day leave and go to the Independent Party. One word, yes or no?</p><p>CLARKE: Probably not. I'm an old Tory. But they could elect a new leader who won't lead me anywhere. So, just for old time's sake and old loyalties, probably see it in the Conservative party over my remaining time in the House.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. And we'll see how all this turns out. Kenneth Clarke, thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>And we turn now from one roiling crisis to another. Facebook announced today that it would ban all praise support and representation of White nationalism and separatism on its main platform, and also on Instagram. It comes less than two weeks after a suspected gunman in New Zealand used Facebook to live stream his attack on two mosques, which left 51 people dead. And after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said social media platforms must be held to account.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACINDA ARDERN, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: There is no question that ideas and language of division and hate have existed for decades but the form of distribution, the tools of organization, they are new.</p><p>We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what are seen on them is not the responsibility of a place where they are published. They are the publisher not just the postman.</p><p>They cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, Silicon Valley faces a crisis of credibility. Big tech companies have gotten so powerful that Democratic Presidential Candidate, Elizabeth Warren, has proposed that the Federal government break them up.</p><p>Kara Swisher knows the intricacies of this story perhaps better than anyone. She is founder of the website, \"Recode,\" and tells me why she thinks there is little danger in underestimating the scale of the crisis.</p><p>Kara Swisher, welcome to the program.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, RECODE CO-FOUNDER: Hi.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you just heard the prime minister of New Zealand after this terrible massacre basically declared that Facebook is not just a postman, it is a publisher. So, what do you make of Facebook, our time overnight, dropping this new sort of statement saying that they will ban White nationalism and separatism from their platforms?</p><p>SWISHER: Well, it's a long time coming. It's something that everybody has been urging them to do. They've been trying very hard to sort of toe the line between being a technology company and a media company and never admitting that they're a media company like a lot of media companies and they have certain responsibilities.</p><p>And so, one of the things that I've been pushing on and many people have been pushing on is this abrogation of responsibility for what's on their platform, and it's not benign and it's quite dangerous and can lead to terrible things.</p><p>And obviously, what happened in New Zealand is a tragedy and it's the fault of the gunman, but he -- this was an attack that was built for the internet and broadcast on the internet and these tools were used by this gunman as part of his horrible plan to kill all these people and it was important part because he thought it was important to broadcast what he was doing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: That's right. And he said that in his rant, and specifically, Facebook not just any old media on the internet but specifically Facebook and specifically streaming it.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me read you Facebook's statement, because it is interesting. \"Our policies have long prohibited hateful treatment of people based on characteristics, such as race, ethnicity or religion, and that has always included White supremacy. Over the past three months, our conversations with members of civil society and academics have confirmed that White nationalism and separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from White supremacy and organized hate groups.\"</p><p>I mean, how do you read that? Because -- I mean, are they saying what we - - you know, we took down some stuff but now we're only already conflating it altogether and taking it all down? I mean, it's incremental --</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- everything that they do.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I usually after massive tragedies and huge pushback.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, you know, the thing is, I did an interview with Mark Zuckerberg last year where we had this argument about Holocaust deniers, if you remember, and he said, \"They don't mean to lie,\" and I was like, \"They mean to lie,\" and it goes back and forth.</p><p>And so, it's a really difficult thing. They're running a platform that is so complex from a technological point of view but is even a quantumly more complex as a social thing. Like it's not just social media, it's affective all of social, whether it's in Myanmar or the Philippines or here in this country or in New Zealand, everything that goes across this platform has an impact in real life.</p><p>And I think that's something that's been -- these are not malevolent people who run Facebook, these are not people who do not understand the gravity of the situation, it's just that they don't want to be responsible for what the tools that they have built results in. And now, they have to.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, now they have to after, you know, New Zealand. And you've just mentioned Myanmar and India and the Philippines. So, let me fill in those gaps and we can talk about that.</p><p>So, I mean regarding Myanmar, social platforms basically have been the steering wheel to violence in Myanmar and it is specifically on Facebook that the military have spread their anti-Muslim, anti- Rohingya hatred and their rhetoric.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: In India, we know that these WhatsApp sort of conspiracies about what certain villages are doing in villages lead to real life lynchings and injuries. And we know, as you mentioned, in the Philippines, that the, you know, nationalist, populist, some would say, you know, disruptor, Duterte, he has used --</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- it for his drug war, for his attacks on his opponents and just to get elected, because two-thirds of the Filipino population use Facebook and the other one-third doesn't even have the internet. So, these are --</p><p>SWISHER: Larger than that, it's a larger number actually --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Go on then, tell me.</p><p>SWISHER: -- among many people. In the Philippines, it's even larger. I just did a big column in \"The New York Times\" and also had done interviews with Maria Ressa who is a column -- who runs a site there called \"Rappler,\" and she's under attack. She's been arrested several times under very trumped up charges essentially. But she's been a big critic of Duterte and that's -- that Facebook has been used to attack her.</p><p>Now so, just to be fair, it's also Twitter, it's also Reddit, it's all these platforms that do not have -- that have immunity for what goes over their platform. So, I think a lot of people feel that they should be made responsible for what happens just the way a manufacturer would be or a chemical manufacturer or anybody else, where something that they use leads to something else, and it's a very clear and bright line.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, it is a clear and bright line to people like you and people like us maybe who are watching the fallout. But what are they like when you talk to them? I mean, and you know them better than ever.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, these are massive infractions that lead to real life death, injury and disaster. This is no longer something that you can just shrug off and say, \"Well, we're good people but we're not responsible for how our platforms are used.\"</p><p>SWISHER: They're not saying that anymore. They're saying that we were too slow to realize on lots of things, including Cambridge Analytica, some -- you know, misuse of the platform by Russians, Russian -- the Russian government in the elections, things like that. So, they're very aware that this platform is being misused.</p><p>And so, now what they're saying instead of saying, \"We didn't know,\" which was the first thing. The second thing was, \"Oh, we're so sorry.\" And the third thing was, \"Now, we have to do something about it.\" And now, they have to do something about it which has been urged by people for so long.</p><p>And I think the issue is that they're sort of wrestling with the complexity of what they're doing and perhaps not up to the task. I mean, this is a -- think about it, it's like running a -- the way I look at it is, they've created these cities and I've used this example at \"The Times\" and other places, they've created these cities and they've declined to put in police, sewer -- sewage, fire men, street signs, anything else. And, so every night it's like the purge. You know what I mean? Like you don't know what you're going to get.</p><p>And so, good citizens are sort of caught in this city where Facebook and other platforms are collecting all the rent and becoming obscenely wealthy doing it, sort of left to their own devices, and I think that's something they have to realize that they have responsibility the way any media company has over what is broadcast by it or what is put out by it. And I think that's going to be a very hard and difficult journey for these executives.</p><p>Because again, they're not malevolent. I just think they, one, didn't realize what would happen. And two, now that they realize what's happening don't quite know what to do. And so, this is a step in that direction.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I think you've really given a brilliant analogy with that village and not putting in the infrastructure or rather the cities without the infrastructure to police themselves and collect the garbage and all the rest of it.</p><p>But let me ask you this, because they have been told and Facebook has been told and you would know it better than I that they need a lot more people to patrol and remove this content.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, look at this, 2.32 billion monthly active users, only 30,000 content review stuff. That is something they can change from one week or one month to the next.</p><p>SWISHER: Sure. But the issue is this, you don't understand the massive amount of information that are rolling over these systems. I mean, not just -- it's not just Facebook, YouTube has the same problem --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>SWISHER: -- around content on there. The -- and the amount of content that is going over these systems is unprecedented in human history. This is the biggest experiment in human communication in the history of man and it is not going well. And it's because these tools -- first of all, content moderators -- and we written them a lot about this. There was a great piece by Casey Newton recently in \"The Verge\" about these content moderators, it's a terrible job.</p><p>Secondly, you can't have -- there's not enough people in the world to moderate all the stuff that's going over and it's very expensive, by the way. So, they're trying to use AI to do that. Now, AI is still in infant stages in this kind of stuff, although some of it's very sophisticated. And so, the question is, if you created these platforms where massive amounts of information is flooding over it and then you decide to build a dam, how difficult would it be to build the dam while the water is rushing over it? It's -- to me, it's almost impossible.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So, if you a king of tech land and social media and all these problems and you could. put in a corrective measure -- you just said it's almost impossible, is there anything, given everything you've just said, that can actually be done to really materially mitigate this, not just playing around at the edges?</p><p>SWISHER: Right. Shut them down. I mean, sorry to say. I mean, that's really -- these tools are astonishing in many ways and they're amazing. We all use them every day. But they don't have any governors, there's no governors around them. And I'm not quite sure that they're not going to -- they can they can make some very big efforts in areas like White supremacy, White nationalism, they can do it in hate speech. They've done it with terrorism. They've definitely made some real inroads in shutting down the uses of their platform by terrorists.</p><p>One way Mark Zuckerberg wants to go now is to pivot to privacy, which means encrypted stuff, which is problematic because it hides under the covers there. That said, this massive ability to broadcast is something that you can fix like on WhatsApp by limiting the amount of people you can broadcast to by not allowing it to go viral.</p><p>[14:30:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let's just delve even further now. Let's move on to Google and some of the more controversial uses of this unbelievable technology, the likes of which we have never seen before.</p><p>So let's just start with President Trump saying that he's just met with the head of Google. \"He stated strongly that he's totally committed to the U.S. Military, not the Chinese Military. Also, we discussed political fairness and various things that Google can do for our country. Meeting ended very well.\"</p><p>This, of course, slightly in response to last year Google's project Maven, a Pentagon research initiative to develop algorithms to analyze drone footage. And that was shut down after thousands of Google employees sent letters saying that we are not in the business of war.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So let's talk about that then. Because what is President Trump saying and what is Google's responsibility now in terms of its military applications? And particularly, the whole sort of China-U.S. stand-off?</p><p>SWISHER: Well, that was -- I don't know what he's talking about there. Google's not working for the Chinese Military. It's just -- that was - that is the side light. I think the issue is whether Google employees want to work for anything military, whatsoever, especially and including the U.S. government.</p><p>And a lot of employees do not want to do this. They do not want to work on drone technology. That's not what they signed up for when they were working for a search engine or whatever Google is doing.</p><p>And so because employees have a lot of power at these companies -- as you know, the talent pool is very tight. They have been objecting to some of the stuff Google is doing. It's happened at Microsoft. It's happened at Salesforce. It's happened all over technology.</p><p>And the question is, how do you solve that? If you want to do work for the government, like Amazon is doing some work around cloud, you know, everyone is going to hit the government in some place. And it is great business for a lot of these companies and it is great growth.</p><p>And so a lot of people at Google do not want to do this work. And so the question is, should you take -- make a separate division that works on it and people who are very aware of what they're making does it? Do you stop doing it altogether? Do you -- there's all kinds -- again, these are giant ethical issues that these companies have to face.</p><p>And in the past, you didn't have employees that spoke up and said, I'm not doing this, whatsoever. And then there's the question of whether Google is a global company or is it an American company. And so that's an interesting question.</p><p>I think Google thinks of itself as a global company based in America and thinks in a very different way from this tweet, which I found confounding. I'm not sure what he was saying in it.</p><p>But I do think they are facing pressure from this government and other governments to fall in line with some things that we're doing here. And the question is whether they're going to go along with it. I don't know.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And just to follow up on that. I mean you obviously know really well this project Dragonfly that Google was involved in.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, China.</p><p>AMANPOUR: China, exactly. To build a censored search engine version for China. Of course, the Pentagon got all upset about that. But also, Google employees got very upset about that. And then Google apparently dropped it.</p><p>But now, it's been revealed by the intercept that some 400 modifications have been made earlier this year. Is this project still viable, Dragonfly? Is it still being worked upon, do you know?</p><p>SWISHER: Well, I think they've got to think about how they should participate in China. It's a massive market for Google. And let's remember, Google was there and then they weren't. And now, they're trying to get back in because it's such an important market.</p><p>And the issue is around -- many issues around why they should be there, whether they should participate in the way the Chinese government wants them to. But there is an issue of data. One of the great -- data is gold in the future.</p><p>And there's so much data in China. A lot of the Chinese companies do all kinds of things, including facial recognition and things that are not allowed in this country necessarily or wouldn't be or would be objected to.</p><p>And so massive amounts of data are being collected around the world. And the company with the most data is the company that wins because then you put it into these machine learning systems, and you become more powerful because of the amount of data you have in.</p><p>And so Google almost can't not participate in China. At the same time, how they go into China is of question.</p><p>And obviously, if they want to be in that country, they have to adhere to the laws of that country, including doing a censored search engine. They did it in a way before, but this is -- it's become more controversial today because -- for obvious reasons.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I mean let's say they do end up deciding to do it again. How is that going to be reacted to by people like yourself, by people like -- I mean, how will you react if they do go the censorship route, as the price of doing [14:35:00] business in China?</p><p>SWISHER: Well, a lot of companies do that, right. A lot of companies do adhere to those rules. I think what's difficult for Google is when they left, they made a big deal of being on a high horse. You know what I mean.</p><p>We will not allow China to do this, and they made a big deal of don't be -- they sort of were down that \"Don't be Evil\" motto that they have. And so they made a big deal when they left.</p><p>And so going back is sort of what happened in the interim? Did you lose those values that you talked about? And so that's one of their problems is they've been sort of holier than thou when they left.</p><p>And the question is, do they have to get in? How do they get in? If they don't get in, what happens to their competitiveness?</p><p>Most of these people are running these companies, as intelligent as they are, are facing issues that are so massive that we've been -- that governments have been dealing with for centuries, and they're ill-equipped to deal with them.</p><p>And that's what you have to understand. These are -- these problems are massive, and then they change as you move around the globe.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But it's like -- it's kind of like Frankenstein's monster. I'm going to figure out what to do about it.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, exactly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me just ask you quickly to pick up on the other thing that President Trump mentioned in his tweet about Google. And that's that we spoke about political fairness.</p><p>President Trump has vastly already outspent all his Democratic potential challengers all put together regarding the 2020 Google and other ad spending. What did that word political fairness and how -- what do you think that's all about?</p><p>SWISHER: It's ridiculous. It's this idea on the right that these companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter especially, are gaming the system against the right in this country, the Conservatives in this country. It depends on who you're talking to, but that's generally the idea.</p><p>It's not true, but it's gets used a lot. And so what's really problematic for these tech companies, especially the social media companies, is the left doesn't trust them because of what happened with Russia and the abuse of these systems or the misuse of these systems.</p><p>And the right doesn't trust them because they think they're gaming the system for the left. And so everybody dislikes them together. That's one thing we can agree on here in this country.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And, of course, Facebook, as you mentioned, totally under the spotlight because of the Russian interference in 2016. Do you think they have a better game plan for 2020? Can the Internet be properly policed in that regard?</p><p>SWISHER: I don't know. I don't know. I think they're trying. They're certainly making efforts and they've improved.</p><p>It's a question of this growth at all costs idea. As you know, the famous motto of Facebook, which I've said a number of times was \"Move Fast and Break Things\", right? Well, they broke a lot of things.</p><p>And the question is, can they be fixed? And do these systems inherently, the way they're architected, mean you cannot control them? It's an unfettered, free-for-all platform essentially.</p><p>And the question -- they have sort of rules and they kind of do some rules. And they're going to make people angry no matter what they do if they make rules.</p><p>The question is can they just pick the rules they want and stick to them? And that's it. and these are private enterprises. And so just stick to them, and that's the way we're going to be.</p><p>The problem is they're trying to serve way too many people who have way too many differences. And that's going to result in this mess. And again, I go back to the Prime Minister of New Zealand. She's right. They're not a postman. They're something else.</p><p>And so we've all got to figure out together whether it's through regulation, cooperation with these companies as citizens of the world what we -- how we want these things to run. And unfortunately, as you know, that's going to be a really difficult thing to come to some sort of conclusion or agreement to do that.</p><p>And that's what's so hard is that humanity is talking to itself, right? That's essentially what's happening on these platforms. And they're not behaving very well because humanity doesn't behave very well. And they certainly don't behave well on these platforms.</p><p>And so how do you govern something so complex and so, so big? And that's, again, the problem with it that they have. These aren't governments, these companies. They're people who run companies. And that's the problem.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Kara Swisher, a lot for you to keep your eye on and keep us honest. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SWISHER: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And next, we turn to that very, very same topic of citizenship and leadership. Our next guest spends a lot of time thinking about moral leadership. He's the retired Admiral Mike Mullin. Maybe you'll recognize him in this famous photo in the Situation Room taken during the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011.</p><p>He served for 43 years in the military, culminating in being chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the most senior uniformed role in the U.S. Military. And he sat down with our Walter Isaacson to talk about this issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CONTRIBUTOR: Admiral, thank you for being with us.</p><p>MIKE MULLIN, RETIRED ADMIRAL, FORMER CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: Good to be with you, Walt.</p><p>ISAACSON: So we seem to have a lack of courage, political courage in this country. You're an expert on courage. What's happened to this country's leadership?</p><p>MULLIN: Well, I've [14:40:00] said for years, I watched when I was working in Washington, which is almost a decade now, and watched it since as the politics have just become so polarized and polarizing.</p><p>And actually, in Washington, I've watched the leadership group get pulled up to the top where we used to have sort of distributed leadership with very strong committee chairmen and women. No longer the case.</p><p>And it's a very small group of people. The speaker, the majority leader, et cetera, that actually control the agenda, the messaging, et cetera. And you are -- if you want to get re-elected, if you want to be supported in the power structure, you have to toe the line.</p><p>And what we are desperate for are leaders to stand up and say, what we're doing here is wrong. And the political attacks that then occur, if you say that, are legion right now. And therefore -- one of the things I don't understand is why we put all this capital in the bank, if I'm a leader, a political leader, then I never cash it in. I never stand up. I never use it for what I believe in.</p><p>ISAACSON: Well, part of the problem is having to stand up to the president in this day and age. And it used to be congressional leaders would stand up even to strong ones like Lyndon Johnson or George Bush. Why is it that Congressional Republicans, in particular, are afraid to stand up to Donald Trump when they think he's wrong?</p><p>MULLIN: At least my Republican friends tell me that with President Trump, there's a lot of things they don't like a lot, but it's the \"policies, the economy, the border, China, et cetera\", that they're OK with. And actually, I think the worst danger to us as a country right now is the lack of moral leadership.</p><p>I think over a period of what could be eight years with President Trump, you know, that the lack of a moral compass, the lack of values which gets reflected in how he speaks and how he acts, that has a great -- there's a terrific potential to actually just sort of rip us out in the underbelly.</p><p>And we'll be a different country after eight years. Those values and principles, the integrity that we all feel so strongly about that had been with us forever, they are actually being plundered as we speak. And someone's got to stand up.</p><p>ISAACSON: So what you would say to them is that the policy victories, this little victory on tax-lowering or something is definitely not worth it when it comes to the hollowing out of our moral fiber?</p><p>MULLIN: I would actually completely agree with that. I think they're short-term gains, they're short-term wins. And the long term, which is what leaders are supposed to focus on, and that's a difficult target in Washington, is what we're sacrificing.</p><p>And there's a lot that is being sacrificed. It's our future. It's our kids. It's our grandkids. It's our financial capability.</p><p>Look at the size of the debt that we're in. It's the unwillingness to come to grips with the health care challenges that we have in the country, the infrastructure.</p><p>Most of us have focused on education as a problem for years. And we talk and talk and talk, yet we have not had the kind of reform in our secondary system, in our public school system that we absolutely need. And at some point in time, it is really going to jump up and grab us.</p><p>ISAACSON: You're a man of institutions, the Navy, everything else. But let's talk about one I know that you really care about, the FBI. Are you worried that the president of the United States is undermining integrity, the belief in the FBI?</p><p>MULLIN: There was a piece, I think in \"The Washington Post,\" two or three weeks ago about the FBI's inability to recruit. And that has not happened for a long time.</p><p>And the reflection of that is in the institutional breakdown because they have -- for the FBI or of the FBI because they've been under siege now for two-plus years. And they've made some mistakes. The leadership has made some mistakes.</p><p>But I do worry that we're crushing that institution. Also, the same is true in Justice. The same is true in the media. I worry about the state of the CIA, the intelligence community, as well as the State Department.</p><p>And we don't have a playbook sitting around saying here's how you rebuild institutions. But when this is done, whenever that is, we're going to need to rebuild, and we're going to need to rebuild rapidly. When the military was broken after Vietnam, we rebuilt that. But it took us about 30 years to do that.</p><p>ISAACSON: Give me an example of one area where there's something you would do or should do right now.</p><p>MULLIN: I think probably the first thing I would pick would be the [14:45:00] whole issue of people. Am I recruiting good people into the CIA, into the FBI, into the State Department?</p><p>Are there good people staying as opposed to leaving? Are they properly incentivized? Is it a mission they care about?</p><p>And that takes really courageous leadership from inside the agencies as well as the broader institutions or the broader leadership. So it's something from my perspective that I would hope that Congress would focus on as well as these institutions continue to be under such a siege.</p><p>I would center it on how we're doing with our people. But there are other things associated with that. How are we doing -- how are they doing with the resources to do that? Not just to recruit and retain people but to build or rebuild the institutions that have been broken down.</p><p>As we seem to be from an overseas perspective coming home, you know, we are isolating ourselves in a world that I don't think will tolerate isolation, quite frankly, right now and will forgive isolation very easily particularly when you have other countries who I now think are adversaries like Russia and China who are filling that vacuum to a fairly well.</p><p>ISAACSON: One of the things that helped protect and be a bulwark for institutions was some of the military people who won into the Trump administration early on. General Mattis, General Kelly, et cetera, they're out.</p><p>What do you think of their role there? And do you worry that they were not able to keep Trump within norms?</p><p>MULLIN: Well, I was never -- I actually was one of the few that I knew that wasn't overly enthused with military leaders being inside the civilian leadership of our government. It's not what we do.</p><p>They're extraordinary people. They are patriots, and they wanted to move the country forward. And all of them wanted to do that in a very constructive way, but our system isn't based on military leaders. It's based on civilian leaders.</p><p>And each of them now obviously are gone. And so I don't know where the checks are. You'd like to think they would come from Capitol Hill. And I think the elections last September were part of the check and balance that we have in our system, but that's just -- to me, that's just a first step.</p><p>It's less about the check, which you had to have. It's more what does the Democratic leadership and the House actually do with it?</p><p>And one of my biggest worries is it just turned -- they just turn it around and play their own version of the Republican playbook, which has been out there for the last couple of years, back at the president. And so we continue the polarization and we absolutely go nowhere.</p><p>ISAACSON: So you think the Democrats are at fault, too, for now trying to play Trump's game and become polarizing?</p><p>MULLIN: Where we are as a country -- I mean President Trump was incredibly disruptive. And President Trump is not the problem in the country. President Trump, I thought, was symptomatic of the challenges that we have as a country.</p><p>And there are plenty of political leaders in Washington that brought this to us over a period of years. And I think it's important for those leaders to change. And if they can't change, they need to move out of the way and let the younger people take over.</p><p>ISAACSON: But you've said something just now that's sort of confusing to me. You think that it's not Trump but that Trump is a reflection of a larger thing.</p><p>MULLIN: Right. Yes.</p><p>ISAACSON: You do not think we're a better country than this, that we have more of a moral compass than our leadership?</p><p>MULLIN: Oh, and no, absolutely. Absolutely. When I speak publicly, you know, I talk about the challenges and they're significant. Usually, in the Q&amp;A part of that, someone says have you got anything positive to say because we're going through a lot?</p><p>We have to address this -- the race issue in the country. We have to address the income inequality issue in the country, the income distribution issue in the country, if you will, in ways that we just haven't. And we haven't done it over decades. It's not brand new.</p><p>So what's going on right now is focusing on that, but if all we have from the Democratic side is a reaction, and let's swing the pendulum as hard in the other direction as possible, we're not going to answer those questions. And that, to me, is the essence of what some leaders -- and it doesn't take many, but it takes a few from both parties have to recognize to figure out how to move us forward together.</p><p>And in the last 10 years, it's been how to move us nowhere because we're apart. And that's fundamentally, I think, the challenge that we have.</p><p>ISAACSON: So what is the effect, do you think, of America retreating from the world stage?</p><p>MULLIN: I believe we live in a world where we are dependent on friends and allies and relationships and engagements. And I don't think the world is going to just let us walk.</p><p>I mean one of the drivers for that [14:50:00] is just the global aspect of the economy. We can't not be out there. We have to be out there.</p><p>And these institutions, NATO is an example, and alliances, the alliance we have with Japan, the alliance we have with South Korea, they're coming under question. The leaders are asking if we're going to be there for them.</p><p>And I think there's more damage than we realize. When I talk to my foreign friends, I ask them, tell me what you see because we're in the middle of it here.</p><p>And I don't think we'll think it's as bad as it is. And they're pretty devastated. Pretty quickly pretty devastated. And they're trying to figure out what they're going to do for themselves as we leave the stage if you will.</p><p>And again, back to the vacuum piece as China and Russia and others sort of step in to fill that vacuum. So it's a huge, huge challenge and shift. That's something else, you know, when \"this is done,\" we're going to have to focus on and rebuild very, very rapidly.</p><p>ISAACSON: You've spoken of China's leader Xi Jinping as being a threat to the global order and world stage.</p><p>MULLIN: Yes.</p><p>ISAACSON: What -- leaving aside the economic threat for the moment, what is the real threat from China? Are they an expansionist nation? Are they going to build aircraft carriers to compete with the ones that you commanded?</p><p>MULLIN: They're not going to build aircraft carriers as big or competitive from a warfighting standpoint as we have, but they're building them. And they consider that to be a really critical part of their expansionism if you will.</p><p>I actually heard a presentation from Bob Kagan two years ago that talked about what China was doing in the South China Sea. And the analysis that he used was the United States in the Caribbean in the early 1900s.</p><p>They were focusing on their waters, close by, stabilizing that, getting control of that, from which we then started to project power. Some in World War I and certainly massively in World War II and ever since.</p><p>That they're using that example. They want to get control of the South China Sea. Four of the five top economies in the world are out there. It needs to be stable. They think they own it.</p><p>And I think -- and they have started to expand. And they may say they're not an expansionist power, but in terms of engagement around the world and if you go to any continent in the world, there are a lot of Chinese investments right now.</p><p>So -- and with that will be a requirement to secure them. And that's going to be an expanded military to do that, that's natural. That's what we've done.</p><p>And I think the relation -- I think our relationship, U.S. and China's relationship, is the most important relationship in the 21st Century between two countries, mostly driven by the economies, and the militaries will follow.</p><p>I also am not a fan of Xi Jinping. I mean they've made him, you know, basically the head of the place for life.</p><p>He's consolidated power. He's very, very strong. He has his own challenges. He's still got 800 million people that are in need there, and he's got to figure out a way to bring that up, create more middle class.</p><p>It's interesting that his future really, I think -- China's future resides in that middle class as we here in the United States continue to hollow out our own middle class. And I think we've got to reverse that part of who we are and then figure out how to make it work together with China.</p><p>And I'm much more hawkish on China than I was a few years ago because we've given Xi Jinping a lot of runway, and he's taken advantage of it. We need to draw a line in the sands and say that's it.</p><p>ISAACSON: You've painted a somewhat bleak view of America and America in the world. What should America be doing right now to get it right?</p><p>MULLIN: Well, I think we have to, first of all, recognize where we are. As a kid of the '60s and '70s, we've been through tougher times. I mean I remember that. The bombings, the race riots, the social revolution, you know, a president who certainly lied and resigned, if you will, in President Nixon.</p><p>So I 'don't -- it's different now, but at the same time, in terms of intensity and where we are in the overall crisis and evolution, I don't think we're close to that. We're moving in that direction.</p><p>And I don't see us on the upswing. I see us in decline, quite frankly. It's almost like a failing company. You can kind of see it happening. I think the question for America is will leaders step up and pull us out of that downward spiral before we crash or have some catastrophic event that galvanizes the American people and out of that some leader rises, he or she, that says, OK, here we're going to go and the American people align themselves with that leader.</p><p>And I think that's really where we are. The indicators are not positive right now. [14:55:00] Doesn't mean everything's bad. We're a country of incredible wealth, incredible resources, incredible innovation, and incredible leadership. We just need to bring all that to bear, recognizing where we are right now to get us headed in the right direction.</p><p>ISAACSON: Admiral Mullin, thank you for being with us.</p><p>MULLIN: Thanks, Walt. Good to be with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: That was a really timely warning from one of the more thoughtful soldier-scholars of our time.</p><p>And that is it for our program tonight. Thanks for watching. And goodbye from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019032801cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-56R1-JB20-G4KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The British government will publish later this month the results of a consultation into policing online platforms such as Facebook and Google, detailing the measures it plans to introduce after Britain leaves the EU on January 31, British daily The Times reported.  New regulations likely to emerge include placing the companies under a statutory duty of care, enforced by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. </p><p>Foreign companies would be required to appoint a British-based director who would be held personally accountable for any breaches in the duty of care, under new \"senior management liability\" rules. Breaches of the rules would result in fines, and could even result in jail time for the company managers. Ofcom will be responsible for drawing up legally enforceable codes of practice detailing what the tech companies need to do to protect internet users from harmful content. According to The Times, the rules will cover terrorism, child abuse, illegal drug or weapon sales, cyber-bullying, self-harm, harassment, disinformation, violence and pornography. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party pledged to make the changes in their recent election manifesto, which read: \"We will legislate to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online \u2014 protecting children from online abuse and harms, protecting the most vulnerable from accessing harmful content, and ensuring there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online.\"However, tougher measures floated in the consultation, such as asking internet providers to block access to sites or apps being accessed from Britain, are not likely to be introduced. A levy on technology companies to help fund the extra regulation is being considered, although penalties for breaches of the regulations will be tapered to avoid hitting smaller companies harder than the big tech giants. In the Queen's Speech given in December, the government promised to move forward with legislation following the consultation, with a voluntary code of practice being introduced before the legislation comes into force to encourage companies to re-think their approach to harmful content online. Concerns were raised when the consultation was released over the summer that the measures could impact press freedom, but the Conservatives pledged in their manifesto to protect the free press. The Campaign for Antisemitism welcomed the tougher regulations, saying that they had \"long called\" for \"social networks [to] proactively search for and remove hate speech from their platforms.\"In a statement on their website they added: \"It is reassuring to hear that social media sites will be held responsible for cleaning up their own sites. It is vital that Ofcom ensures that complex hate crime on social media is properly identified and understood, and that antisemitism is carefully monitored.\" <br/>All rights reserved  The Jerusalem Post 1995 - 2019  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/43/157830603450.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/43/157830603450.jpeg</url></p><p>A lock icon, signifying an encrypted Internet connection, is seen on an Internet Explorer browser in a photo illustration in Paris April 15, 2014 (photo credit: MAL LANGSDON/REUTERS)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JPCOME-163863274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JPCOME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXC-6NG1-JDJN-61T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411390</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Jerusalem Post.

The report called on U.K. lawmakers to create regulations to hold tech giants like Facebook accountable for the malicious spread of online information.Parliament lawmakers reviewed a series of internal Facebook documents they obtained late last year from Six4Three, an app developer that filed a lawsuit against Facebook in the United States in 2015. According to the committee, those documents showed Facebook was 'willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data' to other big tech companies[2] like Netflix and Spotify. Facebook has previously stated that it never sold users' data and that those companies were business partners.The report, which is 108 pages, also said Facebook was intentionally 'starving' its competitors by limiting data access to those apps, as alleged in Six4Three's lawsuit. </p><p>Parliament should investigate whether Facebook is 'unfairly using its dominant market position in social media to decide which business should succeed or fail,' according to the report.Facebook did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment. Karim Palant, the platform's public policy manager in the U.K., toldCNN[3] that Facebook had not broken any laws.'No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do,' Palant told CNN. 'We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.'Facebook has also been accused of spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. election and the U.K. 'Brexit' referendum on European Union membership. U.K. lawmakers said the tech giant broke the law last year after meddling with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultant that wrongly accessed the data[4] of 87 million Facebook users. 'These last 12 months really have been a period of investigation and discovery,' Damian Collins, the committee's leader, told The Washington Post[5]. 'But I think the year ahead has to be a year of action.'The report said tech giants like Facebook should be legally required to follow a code of ethics and immediately remove harmful online content like disinformation, and that independent regulators should be allowed to monitor and fine those platforms that don't follow the rules. Collins told the Post he plans to make Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify before Parliament if the the tech mogul ever lands in Britain. The lawmaker first shared that sentiment after Zuckerberg failed to appear at hearings multiple times last year.

Now, Britain is adding its voice to the worldwide backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech is reducing consumer choice and harming innovation, according to a British government report released on Wednesday. The government, as a result, needs to overhaul its antitrust policies. </p><p>  The 150-page report, ordered by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, the country's top treasury official, said the country needed stricter rules on acquisitions in the technology industry and stronger oversight to make sure that new rivals cannot be squashed.</p><p>  ''There isn't sufficient competition today,'' said Jason Furman, a professor of economic policy at Harvard who led the group behind the report and a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. Addressing that, he said, ''is one of the most important economic policy questions'' in the world today.</p><p>  Last week, <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>Democrat of Massachusetts and a presidential candidate, called for breaking up the largest tech companies. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat of Minnesota who is also making a White House bid, has proposed taxes and antitrust laws against the industry.</p><p>  Officials in the European Union have been particularly aggressive in pushing back against the industry, issuing billions of dollars in penalties against Amazon, Apple and Google for antitrust violations and tax avoidance, while passing strict privacy regulations. The European Union is weighing copyright regulations and rules to stop the spread of disinformation.</p><p>  Individual countries in Europe have taken stands as well. France has proposed taxes on technology companies, while Germany passed a law against online hate speech.</p><p>  In India, the government last year imposed rules against the e-commerce operations of companies including Amazon and Walmart. The country is also weighing regulations to block certain internet content posted on social media deemed libelous, an invasion of privacy, hateful or deceptive.</p><p>  The tech industry has thrived over the past two decades thanks in part to little government regulation. The companies say that it has allowed them to develop products that benefit consumers, like free internet services and online shopping.</p><p>  The panel said that this hands-off approach had benefits for consumers, but that it had also created consequences related to privacy and lack of competition.</p><p>  Critics have argued that existing competition laws cannot keep up with the fast pace and rapid growth of the tech industry. By the time authorities issue a verdict, the underlying technology has changed and companies have moved on with even greater power.</p><p>  Last year, the European Commission issued a record fine against Google of 4.34 billion euros, or about $4.89 billion, for antitrust violations related to its Android mobile operating system. But the case took more than three years to conclude, and is still being appealed.</p><p>  Over the last 10 years, the report said, the five largest tech companies have made more than 400 acquisitions globally. None have been blocked, and only a small number have had conditions attached for approval.</p><p>  ''Competition policy will need to be updated to address the novel challenges posed by the digital economy,'' the report said.</p><p>  Mr. Furman's panel called for the creation of a ''digital markets unit'' that would require companies to allow consumers to move data from one service to another. Large companies would also have to make data available to competitors, a bid to lower barriers to entry by forcing them to share information. The report also calls for a code of conduct to be drafted for the biggest tech companies that would be enforceable with fines.</p><p>  The recommendations are part of a broader review of tech industry policies as the country prepares to exit the European Union. British officials are also considering taxes on tech companies and making internet companies liable for the spread of misinformation, hate speech and terrorist content on their platforms.</p><p>  Any regulations would still need to be agreed to by Parliament.</p><p>  In the United States, Ms. Warren's regulatory plan would force tech giants to reverse some acquisitions, including Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deal for Whole Foods and Google's purchase of the mapping company Waze. Companies also would be prevented from transferring or sharing people's data with third parties.</p><p>  Mr. Furman, the Harvard economist and former Obama adviser, said breaking up the companies was not yet necessary. But he voiced some regret that the White House did not do more to regulate the tech industry while he was there.</p><p>  ''I wish we had gotten to some of the competition issues sooner,'' he said.</p><p>  A common argument against competition regulation is that new companies will emerge as technologies change, just as Google and Facebook overtook older technology.</p><p>  The British report said that rationale no longer applied because the barriers of entry for young companies were much higher. The largest companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are leaders in the most promising emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence.</p><p>  ''The companies most able to take advantage of it may well be the existing large companies because of the importance of data for the successful use of these tools,'' the report said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Above, an Apple billboard in Britain, where officials have warned about declining competition in the tech industry, echoing a claim by <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>left, who wants to break up the largest companies.

The plan, which includes an independent regulator funded by a levy on internet companies, will be open for public comment for three months before the government publishes draft legislation.</p><p> \"No one in the world has done this before, and it's important that we get it right,\" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told the BBC.</p><p> While the United States has largely relied on market forces to regulate content in a country where free speech is revered, governments in Europe have signaled they are willing to take on the tech companies to block harmful content and prevent extremists from using the internet to fan the flames of hatred.</p><p>Britain will consider imposing financial penalties similar to those in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which permit fines of up to 4% of a company's annual worldwide revenue, Wright said. In extreme cases, the government may also seek the power to fine individual company directors and prevent companies from operating in the United Kingdom.</p><p> Criticism of social media sites has grown amid concerns that extremists like the so-called Islamic State group or far-right political groups are using them to recruit young people, pedophiles are using the technology to groom victims and young people are sharing dangerous information about self-harm and suicide.</p><p> Australia last week made it a crime for social media services not to quickly remove \"abhorrent violent material.\" The crime would be punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 10.5 million Australian dollars ($7.5 million), or 10% of the platform's annual turnover, whichever is larger.</p><p> After the March 15 mosque shootings that killed 50 and wounded of 50 more, New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner wants his country to follow Australia's lead.</p><p> European Union lawmakers are set to vote later Monday on a legislative proposal requiring internet companies to remove terrorist content within one hour of being notified by authorities, or face penalties worth up to 4 percent of revenue if they don't comply.</p><p> The bill has been controversial, with some lawmakers and digital rights groups criticizing the one-hour rule. They say it places a much bigger burden on smaller internet companies than on tech giants like Facebook and Google, which have greater resources.</p><p> British Home Secretary Sajid Javid, whose department collaborated on the proposal unveiled Monday, criticized tech firms for failing to act despite repeated calls for action against harmful content.</p><p> \"That is why we are forcing these firms to clean up their act once and for all,\" Javid said.</p><p> Critics say the end result could be that Google and Facebook end up becoming the web's censors. Others suggested the rules could stifle innovation and strengthen the dominance of technology giants because smaller firms won't have the money to comply with such regulation.</p><p> \"We worry that this attempt at controlling the internet will entrench big tech players, stymie innovation, and lead to press censorship through the back door,\" said London's Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank.</p><p> As governments press to have the tech giants take on moral accountability, the challenge for the companies will be to translate that idea into the software, said Mark Skilton, a professor of practice at Warwick Business School. Politicians and technical experts need to work on the \"shared problem\" of providing guidance and control that is not excessively intrusive, he said.</p><p> \"Issuing large fines and hitting companies with bigger legal threats is taking a 20th century bullwhip approach to a problem that requires a nuanced solution,\" he said. \"It needs machine learning tools to manage the 21st century problems of the internet, combined with the courage and foresight to establish independent frameworks that preserve the freedoms societies enjoy in the physical world, as well as the online one.\"</p><p>Facebook's United Kingdom head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said the goal of the new rules should be to protect society while also supporting innovation and freedom of speech.</p><p> \"These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective,\" she said.</p><p> Wright insisted the regulator would be expected to take account of freedom of speech while balancing against preventing harm.</p><p> \"What we're talking about here is user-generated content, what people put online, and companies that facilitate access to that kind of material,\" he said. \"So this is not about journalism. This is about an unregulated space that we need to control better to keep people safer.\"</p><p> Danica Kirka is an Associated Press writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-688cf024956ffc8cd664b8342fcb2da7b7352011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-V0D1-DXVP-V0C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The British property technology company also plans to roll out an FCA-regulated current account in the weeks to come, according to an announcement from the firm.   Hammock said it would continue to grow the breadth of lending and money offerings as the company expands and onboard more properties.   \u201cFor landlords the time spent trying to manage the monies for more than one property \u2014 from rent collection to bookkeeping \u2014 can cause headaches. I know this first hand being a landlord myself,\u201d Founder and CEO Manoj Varsani  said in a press release. \u201cWe wanted to alleviate this by developing new tech that automates the mundane duties of managing property portfolios and provides instant insight into how well each house or flat is performing.\u201d   As it stands, Hammock connects with the bank accounts of landlords through open banking. It keeps tabs on payments, rent collections and expenditures without intervention, while offering in-the-moment analytical reporting on how well each rental apartment or house is faring.   Hammock has been created in the Founders Factory Studio and has been developed with the needs of landlords in mind.   In separate news, Zibo has notched $10.5 million in a  Canaan Partners -led seed round. Zibo aims to offer accessible and simplified financial offerings for landlords. Other round participants include Khosla Ventures , SVB Capital and QED Investors .   The firm has launched its own payments and banking initiative to transition landlords away from old platforms harnessing spreadsheets and more manual technologies.   Chris Hsu , the CEO and co-founder of Zibo, said per past reports that he entered the business so he could provide financial resources for his family. As he continued, he started to see a lack of technological help for landlords.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    PYMNTS Live Roundtable: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 \u2013 12:00 PM (ET)     Card products are undergoing changes from form factor to digital-first spend controls to totally touchless capabilities and more. Big-spending demographics like Millennials and Gen-Z reward digital-first features that have demonstrable value, and research shows they will switch financial institutions to gain Big Tech connected economy experiences. Credit union innovation must stay one step ahead. PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster and expert guests debate the best ways to modernize card products and strategies for credit unions at a time of big economic resets and Big Tech incursions.

Britons were the least trusting of all of those media: just 12% trusted information from social media, compared with 83% who had little or no trust in platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>In all, 23% of Americans said they trusted information gained from social media, as did 20% of Germans, and 28% of Canadians. In developing nations, however, the trust was much higher: a majority of Indians (52%), Saudis (52%) and Thais (52%) trusted information from social media - as did 51% of Poles.</p><p>Just two sources of information were trusted by a majority of Britons: national TV news channels (61%) and local news organisations (54%). Only the US was more mistrusting of information sources in general. According to the polling, local news organisations are the sole news sources that are trusted by a majority of Americans (58%).</p><p> Membership Event:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">The new populism: In conversation with Tony Blair</url></p><p>The deep mistrust of social media in the UK and other rich nations comes after a difficult spell for the sector in which companies have been accused of <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">eroding privacy</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">harming children</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">undercutting democracy</url>.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url> highlighted big tech's ability and willingness to harvest data and subvert democracy, while the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">Christchurch shooting</url> is the latest example of terrorism encouraged by online radicalisation.</p><p>YouTube has continually been found showing <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">inappropriate content to children</url>, and all the social networks have been implicated in nation-state information warfare, beginning with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">Russian trolls uncovered on Twitter</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">after the US election</url>.</p><p>Episodes such as these explain why Britain is leading calls for increased levels of regulation of social media and technology companies. More than 60% of Britons think those businesses should be regulated more than they are now, compared with just 6% who think there is too much regulation and 15% who think there is the right amount.</p><p>The calls for stronger regulation come as the UK government is consulting on legislation intended to make Britain \"the safest place in the world to go online\". The Online Harms white paper proposes imposing a new duty of care on companies that host user-generated content online, and landing them with strong penalties, potentially levied personally on individual executives, if they fail to live up to that duty.</p><p>In the US, those calling for increased regulation were comfortably the largest group: 47% of those polled believed the industry needed more oversight, while 14% said it needed less, and 21% said it was about right.</p><p>Those figures place the US near the middle of the pack when it comes to technology regulation: less supportive than countries such as France (56% calling for more), Spain (61%), and Turkey (65%, with 16% who think there is too much), but more supportive of harsher laws than Germany (46% in favour), Sweden (32%), or Japan (27%).</p><p>Appetite for regulation appears broadly correlated with beliefs about the extent of the power and influence technology companies have. Two-thirds of Britons polled said influence was too high, again the highest proportion in the world. At the other end of the scale, Japan was again the most comfortable with technology companies, with just 26% expressing concern about that power, compared with 29% who felt it was just right and 19% who felt the sector should have more power.</p><p>The finding suggests the stereotypical view of the US as supportive of laissez-faire market liberalism may be increasingly out of date when it comes to technology. However, the survey results may also reflect the relative lack of regulation in the US, where taming Silicon Valley's technology corporations is becoming a salient political issue.</p><p>Germany, for example, has some of the world's strictest regulations for technology companies, which came into effect in the past few years.</p><p>As an EU member, the country is covered by GDPR, a pan-continental data protection law that allows the authorities to impose steep fines for violations, and it will shortly be covered by the new <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">European</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">copyright</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">directive</url>, which imposes strict requirements on social media companies to take steps to prevent copyright infringement on their platforms.</p><p>Germany also has strong domestic regulations: the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (NetzDG) law that was passed in June 2017 requires social networks to remove \"obviously illegal\" posts within 24 hours after they have been told about them, or face fines of up to (EURO)50m.</p><p>By contrast, the US has seen little variation in the federal laws it has used to regulate the internet for decades. One of the most notable new pieces of regulation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-new-populism-in-conversation-with-tony-blair-59043808621\">Sesta</url>, is a comparatively narrow act aimed at ending sexual exploitation and trafficking online, but other than that, a mishmash of state-level legislation has been the extent of the US response to a growing wave of concern over the way the internet is reshaping society.</p><p>The YouGov survey also suggests that despite widespread use of social media across the world, people generally do not see the platforms as a tool for keeping up with news and current events.</p><p>Just 24% of Britons say they have used Facebook to consume news in the last month, and 14% say they have used Twitter for the same. In the US, those figures are 31% and 13%, with 16% also saying they have used YouTube to follow the news. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53036991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1F-4JK1-JCJY-G41R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The law also prohibits ISPs from refusing to serve customers or charging a penalty to customers who do not consent to the use or sale of their personal data. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2017, Congress repealed a similar regulation passed by the Federal Communications Commission during President Barack Obama's administration.</p><p>In February, four ISP trade groups, ACA Connects, CTIA, NCTA, and USTelecom, filed a challenge to the Maine law, saying it imposes privacy regulations on them but not on other internet-based companies such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, or Amazon.</p><p>The law \"imposes no restrictions at all on the use, disclosure, or sale of customer personal information, whether sensitive or not, by the many other entities in the Internet ecosystem or traditional brick-and-mortar retailers,\" the four trade groups say in their lawsuit.</p><p>The trade groups also argue the Maine law violates their First Amendment free speech rights to use customers' personal data and to send marketing communications about non-broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The law \"excessively burdens ISPs' beneficial, pro-consumer speech about a wide variety of subjects, with no offsetting privacy-protection benefits,\" the ISPs argue.</p><p>The law's regulation only of ISPs \"won't give consumers the protection they want,\" the trade groups said in a joint statement. \"Maine's approach of regulating the collection and use of data by internet service providers only, and not the practices of other companies, including the largest internet companies, data brokers, and others that collect, use, and monetize even more data than ISPs, leaves a gaping hole in the law, is unconstitutional, preempted by federal law, and should be struck down by the courts.\"</p><p>However, supporters of the bill suggest the bill targets a group of companies with unique access to personal data, including web browsing histories.</p><p>\"It's no surprise to see ISPs lobbying against anything that reduces their ability to profit from consumer data,\" said Harold Li, vice president at VPN provider ExpressVPN. \"But even for them, it's quite a stretch to frame it as an unconstitutional limitation on broadband companies' speech, while riding on anti-big tech sentiments to divert our attention from their bad behavior.\"</p><p>The ISPs' complaint reminds Li of an argument telemarketers made against a national do not call list in the 1990s and early 2000s. \"Consumers were annoyed by the proliferation of intrusive calls to their homes, but telemarketers argued that they gave them opportunities to hear about great deals and products,\" he said. \"Once the regulation passed, though, people signed up for the list in droves.\"</p><p>The law attacks a problem that's been happening for several years, added Paul Katzoff, CEO of WhiteCanyon Software, a cybersecurity software firm in Salt Lake City. </p><p>\"ISPs have been selling customer browser history to advertising platforms,\" he said. \"The value to ISPs is so high, they'd probably provide your internet to you for free, in order to keep it.\"</p><p>Online search histories are used to deliver targeted advertising that can be very effective, he added.</p><p>\"If customers knew that ISPs were making money off of them, while they are paying for their service, there would be an uproar by users,\" Katzoff added. \"This closely held secret, and what they sell about each device, is a gold mine.\"</p><p>But courts may be sympathetic to the ISPs' argument that they are getting targeted, said Dennis Sawan, managing partner of Ohio law firm Sawan &amp; Sawan.</p><p>\"I can see a scenario wherein the court is concerned about the singling out of one industry over other similarly situated ones,\" he said. \"Oftentimes, a law of this nature can seem as if it is not sufficiently related to the evil it is seeking to prevent \u2014 but rather a targeted attack on one particular company or industry.\"</p><p>The ISPs' argument that their data practices aren't causing consumer harm may resonate, he added. \"If there is no proof of harm, a regulation cannot logically be related to preventing it \u2014 or so the argument goes.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2366472385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9P-N1G1-JBHT-D3RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Facebook places restrictions on the use of logos, banners and advertising inserted into videos.</p><p>The inability to effectively monetise content on digital platforms, which benefit greatly from content created by local and international media and entertainment companies, has been one of the key issues raised in the ACCC's 19-month inquiry.</p><p>Free TV strongly backs the government implementing the ACCC's recommendation to set up a code of conduct which would require companies like Facebook and Google to negotiate arrangements regarding revenue and data sharing.</p><p>However, Free TV said it would prefer the ACCC govern the code. The competition watchdog has recommended the Australian Communications and Media Authority overlook a code.</p><p>Free TV said the code should include provisions around remuneration deals, information shares between media businesses and the tech giants, flexibility around the display and monetisation of content and dispute resolution.</p><p>Both Facebook and Google have slammed the proposal.</p><p>Facebook argued in its submission there is no imbalance of bargaining power with Australian media companies and claimed it is not an essential gateway for Australians accessing news and information. Google argued that the proposal overlooked more than three billion referrals the search giant sends Australian publishers' way every year.</p><p>\"Due to the restrictive nature of the rules stipulated by Facebook and Google, the content owner is given insufficient control over the content that they have created and which they are seeking to monetise,\" the submission said.</p><p>\"In effect, this means that Australian content is being undervalued and sold at a discount on digital platforms.\"</p><p>Free TV represents Nine, Seven West Media, Channel Ten, Prime Media, WIN Corp, Southern Cross Austereo and Imparja Television. Nine owns The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>The lobby said broadcasters find inconsistency and a lack of transparency around when and to whom advertising is served to along with their content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc777pjw4zxzd1ir7auknu</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-CS11-F0J6-J2NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Our next keynote speaker we're very thrilled to have here with us is Hock Tan, the President and CEO of Broadcom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Hock, before I get into some more Broadcom specific questions, you've been around this industry for many times. You've seen a lot of structural changes in it. So I wanted to ask you about some bigger picture questions.</p><p>So first, as we are just talking about in the ready room, during this work-from-home, COVID pandemic, there's been a lot of changes, some things structural and some things temporary. Talk about how Broadcom has adjusted to this. And do you believe there's some structural changes happening at the company? Or do you think Broadcom can operate just as efficiently in a remote environment as it does when people can work together?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BROADCOM INC.: Well, good morning, Ross, and good to be here. Good to see you virtually. And we're happy to try to respond to that. Well, as you can see, I'm in my office. And speaking for Broadcom on this perspective, we were shut down, locked down like most businesses and most companies, I would say, if not all, in March. Then in late April, we started gradually building ourselves up in terms of back to the office. And today, starting July, we are now at about 50% workforce back at the office. And that's as far as we can go really at this point in North America because of social distancing requirements and various other things given our footprint.</p><p>Having said that, there's obviously a reason why we brought back 50%. Because while in many areas, we can work from home, our workforce, the functions still operate very well working from home. And I dare say in many cases, even productivity is maintained. And I believe we saw that in some other situations, especially in large product development, we need collaboration, very close, constant collaboration between -- within teams of people. And for that -- and then for hardware, obviously, we need labs. We need the labs to run. We need validation.</p><p>So we have worked very well, very carefully, given safety is of paramount consideration, safety of our employees and workplace, to slowly bring in people to work and collaborate for our engineering development. As far as the operating cycle, we're chugging along very nicely now. And in Asia, except for India, our employees are 100% back at work. North America, as I say, is 50%. As far as structural changes, sure, on the demand side, we have seen quite a bit of change. And we kind of indicated that in our earnings call recently.</p><p>What we're seeing is very interesting. We put it in the context. As you know, Broadcom is especially on the hardware side, and it has -- which is 75% of its revenues currently. Basically doesn't do compute. It doesn't do general-purpose computing, doesn't do memory. But networking of connectivity, as we call it, we are pretty broadly based. We are in, I will consider, almost every critical product in connectivity today. A fairly broad range, something like 18 different product franchises for which our business model, we are leaders.</p><p>And they are very -- they are in multiple end markets, as we have indicated many times, ranging from broadband networking to server storage, wireless and pretty much industrial as well. Those are the end markets. What we have not literally pushed -- indicated in the past is metrics across these end markets are who those products we sell going to. And roughly, we're talking about 30% of our hardware going to enterprise, traditional enterprise roughly, 25% cloud and telcos and about 20% going to the consumer. And these are our wireless business. Then, of course, there's 25% in software, infrastructure software.</p><p>Now in this environment, demand environment, here is what's going on. 2019 was a recessionary year for semiconductors, well-known to the whole industry. Having said that, we see that as a cycle. We also see, as we emerge from fiscal 2019 or calendar for that matter, that the market, the tide was risen, the semiconductor. That part of the cycle where there is a recovery. So we put out a set of numbers for our fiscal '20 year as predicating a tide rising across the market and especially infrastructure, not to mention cloud and others, and showing a recovery.</p><p>COVID-19 hit early part of 2020 and immediately saw sectors of demand of the economy shutting down. That's it. Things are uncertain. Things look bad. And what's very interesting is looking back now at the close -- quite the close of fiscal 2020, we're looking back and saying, lo and behold, a surprising turn of events and something I did not even would imagine early part of 2020 when we got hit with COVID-19, economy. What we've seen is on cloud, on broadband, telcos, a sharp increase, whereas on enterprise, in hindsight, we could see work-from-home environment, demand softened. Sectors of economy are closing down like travel and hospitality.</p><p>And kind of looking back now, the 2 -- interestingly enough, we're able to offset each other. Now as far as our infrastructure software is concerned, again, these are 2 of the largest corporations in the world and they are on term contract. So they're just riding through this nicely. What's uncertain is obviously wireless consumer, and it's because the launch, where the biggest part of our customer base is, tends to be at year-end, is always at year-end seasonally. And obviously, we are seeing a delay in that. And therefore, our fiscal '20, which ends in October, do not see part of that.</p><p>But on our -- the rest of our business, it was, quite interestingly, offsetting the other. What I'm trying to get at for Broadcom is we're pretty diversified there. Diversity drove into a very defensive model as it's done now because if you take out the wireless, the total set -- the numbers, top line numbers came in just above what we initially predicted except for totally different reasons.</p><p>Now is this sort of thing permanent is what you're addressing. I don't know. What we see is obviously -- and what you see now then is that cloud -- a lot of people are working from home. A lot of companies have difficulty, obviously, bringing things back on-prem, in the offices. Enterprises cut back. So -- but a lot more -- the digital transformation, we see a big part of our economy, mostly to the cloud. And telcos provide the pipes to the homes, to various parts of it.</p><p>So we see that much stronger, as we have reported, than we set it out to do. In some situations, we see sequential double-digit growth or high single-digit growth for the last 3 quarters. The question is will it be that way next year, which is, by the way, as far as I can imagine, I want to see. And the answer is don't know. But I can imagine a situation that if the vaccine shows up and we restore ourselves back to more pre-COVID-19 social environment, I can imagine that enterprise will pick up on pent-up demand just for that. But I can also see -- foresee in the same situation that cloud and broadband from telcos would cut back down. And we'll be back to where we originally thought we should be. But to be honest, at this point, I can't see beyond that point in 2021.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Well, if you can see all the way into 2021, your visibility is better than most of ours. So we appreciate your discussions on that. Maybe the last COVID-related one is specifically on the supply side of the equation. I know in your last 2 quarters, you had some issues, and then those issues got resolved. Are those now in large part behind Broadcom? So if your customer needs the supply, they can get it? Or are you still dealing with some longer lead times or production issues due to shelter in place, warehouse issues in different regions, et cetera?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: No. The issues we had initially and when the pandemic hit, it's, in some ways, unique to partially us, though it's hit a lot of other businesses, too, which is the lockdown in certain countries, especially in Asia, where we have a significant part of supply chain, countries where there's substantial lockdown. And as a result, some of our back end, especially where there's testing, assembly testing or even our warehouse, would not -- are not -- were not able to operate at full capacity. These are countries in Asia like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines. They were hit. And initially even China. And that undercapacity production activity sort of constrained the supply chain.</p><p>Those are all largely done and resolved. And the lesson we learned, which we started doing during the -- and have continued, diversify, as we have diversified our products, our end markets, diversified or create second sourcing for where we do critical parts of our supply chain. And we actively do that. So lesson learned is diversify the risk in countries, locations.</p><p>Where supply chain is still constrained very strongly is more capacity, capacity as it relates to wafers, leading-edge wafers and capacity -- there is capacity constraint as there is capacity constraint on specific key components like substrates. That is still a real constraint on ability not just of us, I would say, of the industry to fulfill end demand in a manner we would all prefer to do.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: I know you mentioned that dynamic on your last conference call as well. When do you think that gets resolved?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, some things, especially in capacity, I'm sure -- I'm pretty positive by '21, much of that would go away because there will be time for the system, for the supply chain for semiconductors to adjust. And I think by '21, it would be likely resolved by, if not early '21, mid-'21.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Great. Why don't we pivot to the second macro dynamic that's made 2020 an interesting year to put it mildly? And that is the U.S.-China trade dispute and trade tensions. There's a couple of aspects on that. Let's leave the M&amp;A aside as a separate topic I'll get into afterwards. But as far as your ability to ship to certain customers, Chinese vendors being placed on the Entity List, how are you viewing that dynamic? And what impact, if any, has it had on Broadcom in the last year? And how do you think it's going to impact your business going forward?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, this interesting thing, I have to say, is it gets more headlines, frankly, than it probably, in some ways, for our business, from a business point of view for -- especially down to Broadcom, than it really deserts in many ways. Because at the end of the day, you're right, we have been living with this U.S.-China trade tensions and restriction for virtually 2 years, at least 18 months or 2 years. And so we have the benefit of looking back and seeing what it is, even though there's a sense that we should have -- we kind of would expect some of that.</p><p>And here's why it is. First, the semiconductor industry is a global industry, been that way for 50 years, 5-0 years. Long time, over the years, built up common standards and all that. It's a very coupled ecosystem. And I put it bluntly, very tightly coupled, over 50 years of development. It doesn't decouple very -- any way quickly. It doesn't decouple in a year, in 6 months or something, not easily. And it's -- so it is very coupled, number one issue.</p><p>Number two, we sell our products, our products, technology products. At the end of day, those are products, but those are most of the products we do, Broadcom, especially on the semiconductor side, all on the semiconductor, are basically technology. And these are technology serving end users, enterprises, consumers but end users at the end of the day. So what it really boils down to is simply this, and the best way is that we sell through channels. I call an OEM, original equipment manufacturer, be they like Huawei or anyone else on the Entity List. They are channels to the end user, the basic enterprise end user, be they in China or outside China.</p><p>And if -- and the other perspective I want to give on Broadcom is, as you know, our products are all we consider critical important franchises. We don't try to do products that are not. We, in fact, avoid those. So to give you a perspective on where we stand, the whole semiconductor output worldwide, globally, China consumes over 30% today of its output. As a percent of our revenues, our sales to China, exposure to China indigenously, 13%, 1-3.</p><p>What does that tell you? We don't sell commodity products. Whether they are substitutes, they've done that. So what this trade tension has done, obviously, and we've seen that for years, but what it's done the last couple of years, it probably tried to accelerate China in self-sufficiency in semiconductors. Something they would have done anyway given the size of the market, it would have done. Maybe this got accelerated.</p><p>And obviously, the things they could do along are more commoditized products. The products that are less commoditized, which is kind of where our franchises are, they do not -- cannot be easily replaced. I'm not saying it will never be replaced. It will take a long-term for that to happen.</p><p>Hence, that 13%, as I said, what's the 13%, in fact, a year ago, 2 years ago, hasn't changed that much. And what I'm trying to say is if people -- if -- and the end user in those economies would be -- they can't get it from one OEM. Another OEM would be picking up the slack. There will be, over a period of time, an adjustment. And we have seen that over the last 1.5 years of this U.S. trade tension.</p><p>Short term, you're right. On a quarterly basis, you might see some dislocation. But over a period of 6 months, a year, especially in 2 years, these things will all settle down. Market share will shift. But if your products are required, are needed, are critical, then it will end up in the -- where the end user needs it on a legitimate basis.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Thanks for that detailed answer. Let's go to the second aspect of some of the trade tensions, and the way that could apply itself to the semiconductor market and I guess even other markets would be in the regulatory approval for M&amp;A. Obviously, Hock, you've been incredibly active on the M&amp;A front, initially on the semiconductor side and then moving into the software side.</p><p>Before we get into the Broadcom specific aspects of that, I wanted to get your views on the aggregate M&amp;A environment right now, in the regulatory environment given that big M&amp;A in big tech seems to have come back into vogue, especially just yesterday with a couple of gargantuan deals being announced. So how do you view the regulatory environment for those sorts of deals as you've had to go through big deals you attempted to do in the past and unfortunately got blocked at that time?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Yes. Learned the lesson big time there. Thank you. And the environment has gotten much more challenging than we have ever seen it, I think. And in today's environment, especially with the U.S.-China trade tension, with a very aggressive European Commission in terms of scrutinizing any deals, much less large tech deals, I would say then it's very, very challenging to try to make -- to do any tech acquisition and get it through regulatory approval in any fairly normal fashion. I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm pretty sure there are basis in some situations, but it will challenging and it will be lengthy and might be even painful in terms of mitigating conditions that are required. So that's my sense.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: So when we pivot this to what it means for Broadcom specifically, do you think that your balance sheet is back in the position that you'll be playing offense on the M&amp;A front as we look into 2021?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, you were nice to put some words in my mouth to say I have visibility on 2021. I was actually guessing what 2021 might look like, we have a vaccine and post-COVID-19, maybe we won't be. Right now, to be honest, we are looking at 2020, almost at the tail end, but we are obviously starting our process and looking hard at 2021.</p><p>And there were some questions asked of our capital allocation. And it is inevitable because our M&amp;A strategy, as you correctly pointed out, is also dependent on our financial capacity, our financial position in terms of being able to continue a cadence of a decent-sized acquisition once a year.</p><p>And as -- at the risk of repeating myself, Ross, and since we have some 45 minutes, I'll jump in it, as you know, our business model is very simple and clear, okay? We have acquired -- and I don't want to use the word consolidate in the semiconductor industry or any industry. We acquired what we consider critical product lines, products within the semiconductor industry in the past and more recently software. We consider those mission-critical products performing important functions for end markets. We acquired those. And basically, we focus them. We then ensure that we optimize each of them.</p><p>And by that, I mean, we put in the investment sufficiently and as much as we need, sustain each of those franchises. And those franchises, as I said, are in, we believe, sustainable markets. And we make sure we remain -- continue the leader in each of them. We do it across the board. And as I said, we have pretty much done it in semiconductors, in connectivity, not doing memory, not doing general-purpose computing, very clearly in connectivity. We have a whole set of businesses that we almost believe we have a full portfolio almost of those critical franchises in connectivity.</p><p>And we do one at a cadence of on average once a year. So as far as '20 is concerned, with the COVID-19 and the uncertainty, we have pulled back on it. And right now, in '20, what we're focusing on doing, as we have done recently in the last 6 months or so, is shore up our financial position, one of which is we have a significant amount of debt, investment-grade debt, investment-grade position. And we are very, very clear about maintaining that position.</p><p>So we have pushed out the maturities of those debt. And on average now, average 6-month -- 6 years maturity of our debt. In the next year or 2, virtually nothing comes due. That's one. And we did that several months ago as we refinanced in the debt market. That's very favorable. And we're able to do it, pushing them out from 3% a year. Anytime we'll do that.</p><p>Then we focus also on the level of the debt. And last quarter, Q3, we paid down almost $2 billion of that debt. And this quarter, given the strength of our cash generation, we're going to pay down another $3 billion. Beyond that, that's what we're looking at very hard, which is looking at fiscal '21, which begins, obviously, November 1.</p><p>One, we will preserve our dividends, no matter what. Question is, we have a policy, would we increase our dividend? That's something we're looking at. We don't have to tell you that for another 3 months when -- in the next earnings call, when we have clear visibility. So then we go answer your question before you ask that.</p><p>But it also means that -- what does our financial position look like? Well, looking very good given the earnings we have reported in the last couple of quarters. We're generating a huge amount of cash. No travel. It's -- expenses are kind of down. And our demand is still there. And our margins are very, very good.</p><p>So we're generating a lot of cash. And for '21, we have to consider what's our likely use of that cash. For one, for sure, dividends. And the other aspect of it is would we be in a position to stand the cadence of an annual acquisition beginning in '21. We're not sure yet because the other choice of the money -- of the cash we're accumulating is really -- other than, obviously, the dividend is, for sure, preserve. And the level of dividends we have to decide is we could pay down more debt and strengthen our balance sheet further, if there's uncertainty we continue to see in 2021, or continue on the cadence of a thoughtful acquisition of a manageable size on an annualized basis, continue in that model, right? And right now, the answer to that is we're not ready to give you an answer yet until 3 months from now.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: I had to try. I'll try a few more aspects of that. So given the regulatory environment question that you answered before about it being more difficult, does that dictate the size of deals that you would try to acquire and pull off more so than it might have in the past?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Probably it has an influence on that. And because reality is what we call when you do a deal, as we have always thought through, we do actionable deals. We don't sell a must sell. We must want to -- we must want to buy it. That's the usual criteria, and that makes sense. And I said we're not consolidating. We're not buying for the sake of buying. We're buying because our business model is while we can grow our business base organically, both on top line and earnings profitability while we can still grow, we increase it from single-digit growth organically to double-digit growth through thoughtful acquisitions of the nature we want.</p><p>And we figured we can do it in a reasonable fashion if you look at it this way. Right now, our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA is about $12 billion to $13 billion a year. If we buy -- make acquisitions around $5 billion to $10 billion and generate from it, typically, we generate double-digit cash-on-cash return. We would add a nice -- we will put in a nice contribution within that kind of acquisition to grow our bottom line EBITDA double digits when we combine with organic growth.</p><p>And that's very much still our business -- our business model translating to a financial model, which is top line growth, mid-single digits organically and bottom line growth, high single digits organically with acquisitions on a total annual basis of a size of $5 billion to $10 billion. We would be able then push EBITDA growth to double digits on an annual cadence.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: So the types of deals you've done are similar in some ways but very different than others when you pivoted from the semiconductor side to the software side. So I want to dive a little bit into the software side of the equation. First, why did you make that pivot from semiconductors to software? And then secondly, tying back to the regulatory question, given the size of your business in the semiconductor side, do you believe it's easier to get software deals approved for Broadcom than it would be to get semiconductor deals approved?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, this is not really driven by our pivot, so to speak, wasn't really driven by regulatory considerations. It's more on the fact that, as I said, we look at connectivity, we look at networking as the area that we focus on doing. And we really have -- we have today 18 product franchises in that space. We pretty much believe we have almost every key product of importance in the connectivity space. Of course, it's not all, but it's pretty much most of it by then.</p><p>So it's -- and in looking at their ability to continue to do the same kind of business model, it was very logical on our side that we look at software -- infrastructure software simply because the characteristics of infrastructure software, parallels, very analogous, the one we see in semiconductor technology. And in looking at mission-critical technology, in this case software, very important to end-user customers and being able to continue to invest in it and sustain it.</p><p>It -- sustaining implies, too, from our viewpoint growth, but not necessarily crazy growth. It's on a sustained basis and being able to focus on those critical software. So the similarities is very clear. And that's why we pivot into software.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: So the software assets you've chosen to buy, and this might be somewhat similar to some of the semiconductor assets at one point in time, but nonetheless, the software assets weren't what I would describe as the most popular assets for software investors. Talk a little bit about how your view of those assets is different and why that might be a logical difference versus how investors had viewed those assets. And then secondarily, how have those assets performed during the recent COVID downturn? And what have you learned in running them during a challenging time?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, that is a great question, Ross. And I keep thinking about that before, during and now post acquiring, frankly, 3 businesses in this area. And we have Brocade, CA Technology and more recently, a year ago -- almost a year now, Symantec, as you indicated. So let me start off by saying this. In technology, where there's semiconductors, infrastructure software, we all know if we don't -- I want to highlight -- emphasize again, and we prove it, and you're seeing it today in our numbers on semiconductor. This technology is very critical to progress growth, development of our economy globally. But also built within it is enormous, is a deep profit pool, huge profit pool, which interestingly enough, has not really been optimized is our sense.</p><p>That's why we have the opportunity to come in and do what we do. Never really been optimized. Think about how optimization works when you develop a technology and you tell the world, as someone did 50 years ago, 40 years ago, hey, I can count my costs have 50% every year. You put a bull's eye on your bank, and that's what has been happening in the semiconductor industry for many years after that. I mean, yes, and that's engineers by the way. And by the way, I'm an engineer. So if you want to hit it, there's been, too, someone looking at it. But there's a level to love of technology and I'm a bit cynical for some of that.</p><p>But anyway, there is -- but having said that, it rubs off on some of your investors a bit there, right, because there are really 2 kinds of investors. There's one kind of investor, talking of software especially and even semis, who loves growth. These are most like fast money, I call it. They love growth. They want to see growth. There's another kind of investor, I believe, who sees sustainable, stable profit as the most important criteria. It doesn't mean the 2 dots cannot go hand in hand, but they can do extremes as we've seen today. Sometimes it doesn't. Sustainable profit versus just pure growth.</p><p>And especially, we see in the semiconductor companies we buy that are not, as you call it, well, popular or well respected, a lot of software investors love the growth, love growth. And so these companies react to it, and we see that after we bought it, the action and even before, they'll grow at any cost.</p><p>As one example, I'll tell you what I see, is when I bought CA, the last CA was trying to grow at any price. So in our focus, in our rationalization of business as an example, also it's one of the first -- one of the low-hanging fruits we did because what we're seeing one example is, and we mentioned it in the earnings call, the last $300 million of revenues CA was generating. Mostly, I would add from -- not all but mostly from small, medium-sized businesses, enterprises. They were spending over $1 billion a year to keep those back -- to win, acquire and to keep because when it buys -- when you do software -- gain software revenue and when you acquire it, it doesn't come at no cost. A lot of costs.</p><p>The acquisition, selling is one aspect of it, big expensive cost. You see a lot of spending on sales in a lot of software companies. Got to get revenue in that. That's almost a direct correlation. But what is not so obvious below -- behind it is after you get the revenue, you got to do several things. You got to support it. A lot of support cost. That's contractual. And that's also one you need to keep your franchise or your brand going. So support cost is enormous. And you got to not only support it. You got to enable the customer to adopt it. So services cost and adoption cost.</p><p>And finally, as part of adoption and support, customers always ask -- doesn't matter whether they're big, huge multibillion, hundreds of billion dollars of enterprises, banks or medium -- small, medium-sized companies. They want more features beyond just technical currency that you have in supporting your software. They want features, features and features. So you have to support it. The more customers you have, the more development you need to do. So R&amp;D cost shoots up, too.</p><p>So think about that huge amount of cost that goes in acquiring customers. That is some of this -- the characteristics of many of the software companies we acquire. So we obviously focus and change the model. And in doing so, we're able to focus on the core base of customers and invest in selling and having these customers purchase, acquire more software and more capacity and more products. Basically, we try to go after a larger wallet share of the largest enterprises versus trying to scale across 100,000 customers. And that's the basic difference in the business model.</p><p>And to answer your question, has it been successful, I think, yes. The only surprise I have is how enormously profitable one would make this business to be. We found penalizing the sustainability of your brand, of your products, of the perception your core customer base have of you even after you do that. What you chose not to -- we chose not to do is to address the small and medium-sized enterprises who provides a long tail to businesses of CA and Symantec.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Thanks for all that great color. And it does seem like the double-digit bookings growth that you've seen in those software businesses, which I know translates to more single-digit growth, is definitely much better than many of the naysayers had feared and asserted in that.</p><p>So we only have about 5 or 10 minutes left. So I want to dive into a couple of your segments quickly. So first, let's go into the networking portion. Like you said, semiconductor is about 75% of your business. I think networking is about 25% of your total business. There's a big debate...</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: That was 30.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: 30. Perfect. It's even bigger. That makes the question even better. There's a lot of questions about the sustainability of the cloud demand right now. Are we about to enter another digestion phase? What's your view on that? And could it be offset by company-specific product cycles with Tomahawk and Trident and Jericho, et cetera? Or if the digestion starts, it's going to hit Broadcom like everybody else.</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, let me be direct. As we said in our earnings call, we have not seen it. And we are not seeing that digestion phase come in, in our networking business. Now how long -- how far is our visibility in this environment? I guess clear visibility is all important as opposed to speculation and guessing. We have our lead times for our infrastructure products literally. It's north of 26 weeks, 6 months. In fact, many of them over 30 weeks, 7, 8 months. We book that.</p><p>And our policy to all our customers is when you place an order with us, Broadcom, you do -- you're not allowed to cancel. They know that. We have worked with all these customers for years. So they are very thoughtful before they place those orders. So we have that visibility. I'm just translating that to you guys. Beyond that, I don't know. To be honest, I don't know, and I'm not sure how much people will know that.</p><p>All I'm saying here is in networking, which is different, I'd first add quickly from storage and from computing investments, CapEx investment. But in networking, we're seeing that strength. And we continue to see the sustaining quality of that strength for the next 6 months. And so that's -- and that's all I can tell you. And beyond that point, having said that, I have limited visibility.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Then the last thing I wanted to touch on here was a lot of companies that are active in M&amp;A at one point or another also do divestitures. And this will be a segue over to your wireless business. I know you have a significant content increase. You have a long-term supply agreement. But about a year ago, you also described that asset, the wireless asset, as more of a financial asset. Some people on my side call that noncore. That were -- those were our words, not yours. How do you look at divestitures? And why was your wireless business even discussed as something that was a financial asset rather than a core asset?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Well, that's a very good question by the way. And I'll be very direct here. Well, you know that our wireless business, which is about 20% of our revenues today, roughly, as you know, is very seasonal. And it's very focused on 2 large customers. That's 20% of revenue on 2 large customers, in particular, one monster one. Great customer, having said that, because they value technology, they value engineering.</p><p>And -- but as I said, we did -- we have 18 product franchises. So how do we define those franchises? Two things: sustainable markets, as far as we can see sustainable markets, and we are a leader and sustainable leadership in that market. And -- well, a year ago, we were looking at especially #1 customer in Cupertino and asking ourselves, man, this is a very concentrated business for us. I mean it has to be sustainable, looks good, but still very concentrated, very amazing.</p><p>It's a sustainable leadership, sure. But do we bid on paper? Of course, usually, you don't. Today, looking back, yes, I have a 3-year contract. Not only are we #1. We're #2 as well. And so that's the entire market. So okay, we got sustainable leadership, at least for the next 3 years. But someone who signed them for 3 years, you more than have just 3-year leadership. You have sustainable leadership.</p><p>Now as far as looking at is this market sustainable, maybe things have changed somewhat better and looking back over the past year, certainly more recently, what we're seeing. But has it changed a lot? Some, maybe not much. At least we have sustainable leadership.</p><p>So to answer your question, yes, we hardened it into a core asset. And it's clearly a core asset. And as far as are we continuing on it for the time being, yes, because we always look at every one of our franchises and go through that with the banks, that review and ask ourselves, could our investment in those -- the resources we plug into each franchise, could they be used better elsewhere? We thought about that a year ago here. And obviously, our available customers also believe this is not something they don't want us to not think as them as being core and strategic. Hence, the agreements we have in place.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: So we only have 1 minute left. So why don't we just wrap up with the final wireless question on that topic. You mentioned concentration was a reason for your thought process around -- over the last year in that business. You still have a leadership position. It's core, as you said. Did competitive intensity enter into that equation as well? Is there a concentration of competitors that are catching up to you? Or was it more about the concentration on the customer side?</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Customer. No, I'm trying not to be arrogant, but it's hard not to be in the market. In each of our franchise, that's my -- it's -- the leadership we have is way far beyond any competitors trying to come in. And this -- wireless is one clear example. It's across the board in other areas. There will be little guys trying to come in, and of course, there always has been for years and years and years in the business.</p><p>The only thing we do to make sure that never -- that we never have to worry about leadership in the franchise is really to keep investing. And we do that. We invest in a very, very strong manner. We've put in, in all our semiconductor franchises, in all our franchises, over $1 billion, most of it R&amp;D, of investment every quarter of mostly R&amp;D investment. Every quarter, we put in that amount of investment. It's hard for anyone, especially in this environment where incumbency becomes almost everything for any competitor to try to make much headway. And we'll make sure it's very hard to do that.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Perfect. Well, Hock, our 45 minutes are up. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to talk in a relatively early morning out here on the West Coast where you and I are both sitting. It's great to hear from you. Glad to see that people are getting back to work and some normalcies returning. And we really appreciate you taking the time to join us at the DB Technology Conference this year. So thank you.</p><p>HOCK E. TAN: Ross, thanks for the invitation. Happy to participate. Thank you.</p><p>ROSS CLARK SEYMORE: Thank you.
